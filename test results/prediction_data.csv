"Appeals court can rule at any time in dispute over suspending FDA approval of medication abortion drug (CNN)The Justice Department and a manufacturer of abortion pills have submitted the final round of court briefs in the emergency dispute over whether an appeals court should freeze a judge\'s ruling that would suspend the Food and Drug Administration\'s approval of medication abortion drugs.\n\nNow that the filings have been submitted, the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Court could rule at any time on whether to put a hold on the order from US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.\n\nKacsmaryk on Friday night said he was halting the FDA\'s approval of the drug mifepristone but that he was delaying the order by seven days to give the pill\'s defenders time to appeal the case. The Justice Department has asked the appeals court to act by 12 p.m. CT Thursday on its request that Kacsmaryk\'s ruling be paused, to give the government time to seek a Supreme Court intervention if need be. The 5th Circuit is not obligated to meet that deadline.\n\nThe Justice Department wrote in its new filing that Kacsmaryk purported ""to be acting in a restrained manner ... but there is nothing modest about upending the decades-long status quo by blocking access nationwide to a safe and effective drug.""\n\n""Effectively requiring Danco Laboratories and GenBioPro to cease distribution of mifepristone after more than two decades would upend the status quo, severely harming women, healthcare systems, and the public,"" the Justice Department said, referring to the two US manufacturers of mifepristone.\n\nThe Justice Department filing pushed back on the assertions by the challengers, made in their filing overnight in the emergency dispute, that the 5th Circuit did not have the authority to hear the appeal of Kacsmaryk\'s ruling. The Justice Department also called out Kacsmaryk and the challengers for relying on anonymous blog posts to claim mifepristone is unsafe.\n\nDanco Labroratories, which intervened in the case to defend mifepristone\'s approval, wrote in its new filing with the appeals court that if the ruling is not frozen, ""women across the nation will face serious, unnecessary health risks from the elimination of access to a drug FDA has repeatedly deemed safe and effective and that is the standard of care.""\n\nIn an overnight filing, the anti-abortion doctors who sued to ban medication abortion drugs told a federal appeals court that it should leave in place the ruling that will halt the drug\'s FDA approval.\n\nThe anti-abortion doctors defended Kacsmaryk\'s ruling called it a ""meticulously considered"" ruling that ""paints an alarming picture of decades-long agency lawlessness -- all to the detriment of the women and girls FDA is charged to protect.""\n\nMifepristone has been approved by the FDA for terminating pregnancies for nearly 23 years. Leading medical associations have rebuked the claims by the approval\'s legal challengers and by the judge that the drug is unsafe. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/appeals-court-doj-danco-briefs-abortion/index.html"
"Hakeem Jeffries' 'vague recollection' of controversy surrounding his uncle undermined by college editorial defending him For years, Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has told a similar story: he was off at college and shielded from controversies surrounding his uncle, Black studies professor Leonard Jeffries, who eventually lost his job over incendiary comments about Jewish people. Hakeem Jeffries has said he had only a ""vague recollection"" of the controversy, saying he couldn\'t even recall coverage of it in local press.\n\nBut a CNN KFile review of material from a 30-year-old college campus incident sharply undermines Jeffries\' claims.\n\nWhile Jeffries was a college student at Binghamton University in upstate New York, the Black Student Union, in which Jeffries was an executive board member, invited his uncle to speak on campus after his inflammatory comments caused an uproar.\n\nAnd in a previously unreported college editorial, Jeffries defended his uncle along with Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan, writing, ""Do you think that a ruling elite would promote individuals who would seek to dismantle their vice like grip on power?"" He added that they were unfairly targeted by ""White media"" for challenging ""the longstanding distortion of history.""\n\nLeonard Jeffries faced widespread backlash in the early 1990s after comments he made about the involvement of ""rich Jews"" in the African slave trade and ""a conspiracy, planned and plotted and programmed out of Hollywood"" of Jewish executives who he said were responsible for denigrating Black Americans in films.\n\n""Dr. Leonard Jeffries and Minister Louis Farrakhan have come under intense fire,"" wrote Jeffries in February 1992. ""Where do you think their interests lie? Dr. Jeffries has challenged the existing white supremist educational system and long standing distortion of history. His reward has been a media lynching complete with character assassinations and inflammatory erroneous accusations.""\n\nJeffries\' office maintained his record in public service was one of ""bringing communities together"" and said he did not share his uncle\'s views.\n\n""Leader Jeffries has consistently been clear that he does not share the controversial views espoused by his uncle over thirty years ago,"" spokesperson Christiana Stephenson told CNN in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLike Jeffries\' uncle, Farrakhan, the leader of the Black nationalist group Nation of Islam, previously came under fire for incendiary comments about Jews. Farrakhan praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in the 1980s as ""a great man,"" and called Judaism a ""dirty religion.""\n\nThe editorial was mainly harsh criticism of Black conservatives, and contained other inflammatory remarks from the future congressman.\n\n""The House Negro of the slavery era and the Black conservative of today are both opportunists interested in securing some measure of happiness for themselves within the existing social order. In both cases, the social order has Blacks occupying the lowest societal echelon,"" wrote Jeffries.\n\nSoon after he was elected to Congress, Jeffries told The Wall Street Journal in 2013 he only had ""a vague recollection"" of the controversies with his uncle, remembering it only as a tough time for his father and claimed his mother shielded him and his brother from the controversies because he was off at college.\n\n""And so when a lot of the controversy took place and my brother and I were away at school,"" Jeffries said. ""There was no Internet during that era and I can\'t even recall a daily newspaper in the Binghamton, N.Y., area but it wasn\'t covering the things that the New York Post and Daily News were at the time.""\n\nIn another story, the WSJ reported that Jeffries said he had not even looked at his uncle\'s most controversial speeches.\n\nJeffries\' office has repeatedly pointed to the comments made to WSJ when asked about his uncle\'s most inflammatory beliefs, most recently in December 2022. ""His on the record comments made to The Wall Street Journal speak for themselves,"" his office told the conservative website Just The News.\n\nHe made similar comments to the AxeFiles podcast in 2019, saying, ""My father made a deliberate decision to try to shield us from that controversy, because he was very concerned as to how it could just impact our wellbeing, our focus, because it was an intense situation.""\n\nThe incident is receiving renewed scrutiny after first being reported by the conservative Washington Examiner and The New York Times following Jeffries\' ascension to House Minority Leader.\n\nA controversy on campus\n\nIn the summer of 1991, Leonard Jeffries gave a speech at a Black arts festival in which he said there has been ""a conspiracy, planned and plotted and programmed out of Hollywood by people called Greenberg and Weisberg and Trigliani,"" for denigrating Black Americans in films, and that ""Russian Jewry had a particular control over the movies, and their financial partners, the Mafia, put together a financial system of destruction of black people.""\n\nThe comments led to Leonard Jeffries being repeatedly condemned by the Anti-Defamation League and American Jewish Committee.\n\nLeonard Jeffries later compared Jews to ""dogs"" and ""skunks,"" and was condemned at the time by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New York City Mayor David Dinkins. He eventually left his position as chair of the Black Studies Department at City University of New York in 1995, after a lengthy legal battle.\n\nIn February 1992, Hakeem Jeffries was a senior at Binghamton University in upstate New York and a board member of the Black Student Union. The BSU extended an invitation for the embattled professor to speak on campus for an undisclosed fee, drawing outrage from some students on campus and members of the Jewish Student Union. The BSU said the profits from the event would go to a foundation in an honor of a student killed in an auto accident.\n\nAfter a Jewish student group called on the BSU to cancel the professor\'s speaking engagement, Jeffries led a news conference defending his uncle and his speaking engagement.\n\n""We have no intention of canceling a presentation that contains factual information, proven through scholarly documents and texts,"" read Hakeem Jeffries from a statement reported in the student newspaper the Pipe Dream. ""The proper way to way to debate scholarship is with scholarship–not with high-tech lynchings, media assassinations, character desecrations and venomous attacks.""\n\nThe BSU executive board also wrote an editorial in the student newspaper, Pipe Dream, defending Jeffries and condemning a comparison of the professor to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nIn an editorial penned solely by the younger Jeffries in The Vanguard, the BSU student newspaper, Jeffries defended his uncle against the ""White media."" But his harshest criticisms were reserved for Black conservatives, who he called ""token"" and ""opportunists"" comparable to ""house negroes"" during American slavery.\n\nCNN\'s KFile reviewed a copy of The Vanguard in the special collections of the library of Binghamton University. In only one of two available issues of that year did Jeffries write an editorial.\n\n""There has been a recent trend in the Black political arena which I believe threatens to sustain the oppression of the Black masses. The phenomenon I refer to is the rise of the Black conservative,"" wrote Jeffries.\n\n""During the period of African enslavement, our ancestors were given the duality of the Field Negro and the House Negro. The Field Negro labored from dawn \'till dusk, had nothing but contempt for his white master, and most importantly, the majority of Black slaves, who were Field Negroes. In contemporary terms, what we would refer to as \'the masses.\' The House Negroes didn\'t labor in the field, they were domestic servants. The House Negro was dressed up and was led to believe that he or she was better than those in the field. Most importantly, the House Negro sought to emulate the white master. This emulation was not designed with the interests of the masses at heart. Rather, the motivating force was personal gain.\n\n""Perhaps this is the problem with the Black conservative politician of today. Their political agenda is not designed to contribute to the upliftment of their people. These right-wing opportunists espouse the political ideology of the power structure and, in return, they are elevated to positions historically reserved for whites.""\n\nJeffries also attacked Black conservatives for buying into the ""idea of the American dream,"" which he said ignored ""the economic reality of this country\'s capitalist system,"" adding that ""capitalism necessitates the perpetuation of a permanent underclass.""\n\nHe later clarified he is ""not trying to encourage the restriction of Black political thought to one particular ideology"" but to critically examine the phenomenon. He pointed to Black conservatives such as Clarence Thomas and Colin Powell as prominent examples of the phenomenon.\n\n""Clarence Thomas was appointed by George Bush to the highest court in the nation. Colin Powell was appointed by George Bush to lead the military establishment \'policemen of the Wall Street Bankers\', in the words of Cesar Agusto Sandino. Where do you think their interests lie?"" wrote Jeffries.\n\nDays after the editorial was published, Leonard Jeffries spoke on campus.\n\nAccording to press coverage of his speech from the front page of the Press & Sun-Bulletin, the local Binghamton paper, Jeffries spent ""much of the speech defending himself from charges of anti-Semitism"" and reiterated his remarks on ""anti-Black"" Jewish moguls in Hollywood. Speaking on Jewish opposition to his speech, Jeffries compared the opposition to Nazism.\n\n""It\'s ironic that members of the Jewish community felt compelled to take a position that is antidemocratic and….pro-Nazi in its viciousness,"" he said. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/kfile-hakeem-jeffries-college-editorial-defending-uncle-from-antisemitism/index.html"
"New York City appoints its first-ever 'rat czar' Washington (CNN)The search for New York City\'s first-ever ""rat czar"" has come to an end.\n\nKathleen Corradi has been hired as the city\'s director of rodent mitigation, Mayor Eric Adams announced Wednesday.\n\nCorradi will coordinate city agencies such as the Departments of Health and Mental Hygiene, Parks and Recreation, and Sanitation and find ""innovative ways to cut off rats\' food sources"" and use ""new technologies to detect and exterminate rat populations,"" Adams\' office said in a news release Wednesday.\n\nThe city also announced the creation of a ""Harlem Rat Exclusion Zone"" that covers much of the northern half of Manhattan, where $3.5 million will be spent to improve and increase inspections, use equipment such as bait and traps, and harden floors at some public housing to prevent rat burrowing.\n\n""Rat mitigation is more than a quality-of-life issue for New Yorkers,"" Corradi, who previously served as the Queens director of space planning for the city\'s Department of Education, said in the announcement. ""Rats are a symptom of systemic issues, including sanitation, health, housing, and economic justice. As the first director of rodent mitigation, I\'m excited to bring a science- and systems-based approach to fight rats. New York may be famous for the Pizza Rat, but rats, and the conditions that help them thrive will no longer be tolerated -- no more dirty curbs, unmanaged spaces, or brazen burrowing.""\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams, left, introduces Kathleen Corradi, center, as the city\'s first-ever citywide director of rodent mitigation, also known as the ""rat czar,"" in New York on Wednesday.\n\nAs Adams put it: ""The rats are going to hate Kathy, but we\'re excited to have her leading this important effort.""\n\nThe city had unique criteria in mind during the candidate search, looking for someone who is ""highly motivated and somewhat bloodthirsty,"" with both ""stamina and stagecraft."" Not to mention a ""swashbuckling attitude, crafty humor, and general aura of badassery.""\n\nRodents pose a serious public health challenge for the city: They can contaminate food and spread diseases like leptospirosis, according to the NYC Department of Health website.\n\nIt\'s unclear exactly how many rats call New York City home. An oft-repeated urban legend tells us that the city has more rats than people (or over 8 million). But a 2014 study led by statistician Jonathan Auerbach and based on rat sightings reported to the NYC hotline estimated that there were only around 2 million rats in the city. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/new-york-city-rat-czar-kathleen-corradi/index.html"
"GOP House Judiciary chairman subpoenas FTC over Twitter probe (CNN)House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan on Wednesday subpoenaed Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan as part of his panel\'s investigation into the agency\'s probe of Elon Musk\'s purchase of Twitter.\n\nThe House subcommittee investigating the so-called weaponization of the federal government has made Twitter -- and the federal government\'s relationship with the social media platform -- a central focus of its investigative efforts, particularly as it relates to free speech and the First Amendment.\n\nThe subpoena demands the FTC turn over a series of documents and internal communications relating to the agency\'s investigation of Musk\'s acquisition of Twitter by April 26.\n\n""The FTC respects the important role of congressional oversight,"" said FTC spokesman Douglas Farrar. ""We have made multiple offers to brief Chairman Jordan\'s staff on our investigation into Twitter. Those are standing offers made prior to this entirely unnecessary subpoena.""\n\nJordan asserts in a letter accompanying the subpoena that the FTC has ""abused it statutory and enforcement authorities"" and cites a report released by the subcommittee last month alleging the agency ""made inappropriate and burdensome demands coinciding with Elon Musk\'s acquisition of the company.""\n\nThe committee\'s Republicans have also criticized the FTC for demanding that Twitter identify journalists who were given access to the company\'s internal records.\n\nThe panel and the FTC have so far engaged in a back-and-forth over House Republicans\' investigation. But Jordan claims that the agency\'s responses so far have been ""woefully insufficient"" and the committee is moving forward with a subpoena ""to compel the production of documents necessary to inform our oversight.""\n\nSen.

"Did Your Aging Parent Really Win The Sweepstakes? This is a case that really happened as I report it.\n\nA 93 year old grandma played all kinds of sweepstakes and got mailings from them regularly. She loved the excitement of entering contests. She got a letter from one of them, informing her that she had won a huge cash prize. Shortly after, she got a phone call congratulating her on her win. She was so excited. She called her son and reported that she was going to get a million dollars! All she had to do was go to the bank with the lawyer for the sweepstakes company and withdraw the tax on her winnings and he would then give her a check for her prize. The bank was across the street from her assisted living home and he was coming next Monday. She could hardly wait.\n\nElder getting the call she won a cash prize\n\nHer son, Vince, called AgingParents.com, in a bit of a panic. He got the news from his 93 year old mother on a Friday and he had an obligation taking him away for the weekend. He would be back late Sunday night. He thought this story was a scam and he wanted to stop his mother from taking a stranger to her bank Monday morning. I assured him that it was indeed a scam, and that no legitimate company requires that a person pay tax on their winnings in order to get them. Taxes are the IRS\'s business, not a sweepstakes company\'s doings. But how could he stop is mother from this fake ""you won"" trap? Could he get there in time?\n\nSince the fake ""lawyer"" for the scammer was coming to his mom\'s apartment on the following Monday, I advised Vince that he had to go there first thing in the morning and stay with her all day. He did live reasonably close and was able to show up at 7:00am. His mother showed him the letter saying that she had won the million dollars. While he was in her apartment, he collected a tall stack of papers for sweepstakes, lotto and other contests she had entered, all of which now had her name and contact information. Vince knew that his mom had memory problems at 93 and he understood that she should not be solely in charge of her finances anymore. But he just just hadn\'t gotten around to asking her to resign from her trust and let him take over. She had appointed him but she was still solely in charge. Now he was dealing with the scary consequences.\n\nVince intercepted a call from the fake sweepstakes lawyer to his mother at 9:00 a.m. that very Monday, confirming that he would arrive at noon. He demanded to know what company this was and what this man thought he was doing with his mom. The scammer made some excuse about being a distant relative and it got ugly. He hung up. Vince then had to tell Mom that it was a fake and she must never give anyone access to her bank or account number. She was very disappointed but she accepted it, because she loved her son and trusted him.\n\nVince was the duly appointed successor trustee on his mother\'s seven-figure trust, but he had not ever asked her to resign, a step he could have taken long before. I advised him about how to approach her and he did so. Fortunately, she did resign, and the estate attorney completed the transition with the right documents. Now Vince was the trustee over mom\'s accounts. He controlled all her funds. That saved his mom from any other predatory sweepstakes or contest scammers. She no longer had access to her bank account. Vince provided a new, monitored credit card with a low limit and monthly cash for her to spend as she had normally done, excluding contest entries.\n\nVince narrowly escaped failing to protect his vulnerable mother from losing all her money. Imagine the scammer getting access to the bank account and all her assets in it. He could have cleaned it out in a matter of minutes. Learn from Vince\'s mistakes early on that would have stopped this close call.\n\nBillions of dollars are stolen from elders every year in the U.S. The sweepstakes scams are just one way, among many. When our aging parents are alert and doing relatively well in their lives, it\'s easy to get lulled into that false sense of security. We think we don\'t need to upset them by changing anything. But they are aging and changing, sometimes increasing their risks around money. Raising our own consciousness about risks helps. I am sure Vince would tell you how frightening this was and to please act sooner than he did with his mom. https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolynrosenblatt/2023/04/12/did-your-aging-parent-really-win-the-sweepstakes/"

"Justin Pearson Reinstated To Tennessee State House A Tennessee county voted Wednesday to reinstate Justin Pearson as its representative to the state House, after both he and Rep. Justin Jones--who was also reappointed--were expelled from the body after participating in a protest for gun reform in the statehouse.\n\nTennessee Rep. Justin Pearson was reinstated to the state House Wednesday.\n\nThe Shelby County Board of Commission unanimously voted to reinstate Pearson to the Tennessee House, after none of its Republican members attended the vote.\n\nChairman Mickell Lowery indicated he would vote to reinstate Pearson earlier in the week and said he believed Pearson\'s expulsion was ""conducted in a hasty manner without consideration.""\n\nOne commissioner noted they would vote against Pearson\'s reinstatement over fears the state would retaliate by pulling money from its budget intended to fund renovations to a trauma medical center.\n\nThe vote follows a unanimous vote earlier this week by Nashville\'s Metropolitan Council to reinstate Jones, after council member Delishia Porterfield called the House\'s vote to expel Jones and Pearson a ""miscarriage of justice and an egregious assault on democracy.""\n\nSpecial elections will be held later this year for both Jones\' and Pearson\'s seats.\n\nPearson\'s expulsion from the Tennessee legislature was not the first time he faced criticism from House Republicans. Republicans condemned Pearson and argued he violated the state legislature\'s rules for decorum and dress attire after he decided to wear a black dashiki--a pullover associated with West African culture--during his swearing-in ceremony in February.\n\nPearson, a Memphis native and environmental activist, was expelled last week by Tennessee\'s GOP-controlled House over his and Jones\' participation in a gun reform protest at the statehouse the week prior. The expulsion votes were criticized by several major Democrats, including President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. Tennessee House Republicans argued the expulsion votes were ""the only path forward"" because Jones and Pearson had participated in ""disrespectful and deliberate efforts to disrupt the business of the House.""\n\nPearson wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times Wednesday that was ""hoping"" to be reinstated to the Tennessee House. Pearson condemned House Republicans--who have ""done little"" in the wake of the Covenant School shooting last month--for their vote to expel him and Jones.

"Should College Come With Trigger Warnings? At Cornell, It's a 'Hard No.' We cannot accept this resolution as the actions it recommends would infringe on our core commitment to academic freedom and freedom of inquiry, and are at odds with the goals of a Cornell education,"" Ms. Pollack wrote in a letter with the university provost, Michael I. Kotlikoff.\n\nTo some, the conflict illustrates a stark divide in how different generations define free speech and how much value they place on its absolute protection, especially at a time of increased sensitivity toward mental health concerns.\n\nAfter decades of university battles over tinderbox issues of students\' rights, speech codes and how best to grapple with unpopular speakers and ideas, proponents of free speech are lauding Ms. Pollack\'s quick and unequivocal action.

"Has Spring Sprung For These Three Agricultural Equipment Stocks? In this article I use AAII\'s A  Investor Stock Grades to provide insight into three agricultural equipment stocks positioned for success in 2023. With continued recovery from the coronavirus pandemic increasing consumer demand and severe weather impacting the supply of key agricultural goods, should you consider these three agricultural equipment stocks of AGCO AGCO , Deere and Titan International TWI ?\n\nThe powered agriculture equipment market encompasses a wide array of products such as tractors, combine harvesters, planters, sprayers and other equipment performing tilling, haymaking and baling functions. The growth of the powered agriculture equipment market has been extensive. However, a significant share of the population is unaware of the innumerable benefits this equipment has and the extent of government support for the agriculture industry. In the past two decades, next-generation agriculture techniques and technologies have also been adopted by farmers across the globe to increase crop yield and soil fertility, shrink wastage and ensure food security.\n\nThe agricultural equipment industry is coming off a strong year in 2022 as it continues to recover from the pandemic. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 2022 was a record year for agricultural exports, totaling $196.4 billion. This was an increase of 11% compared to the previous year. The USDA confirmed that this increase stemmed from a sales increase in each of the top 10 U.S. agricultural export markets. The top commodities exported in 2022 included soybeans, corn, beef, dairy, cotton and tree nuts.\n\nIn a growing market, U.S. farms need to acquire new equipment and maintain existing machines. The companies featured in this article produce a range of agricultural equipment used on farms across the U.S. In a report published in January 2023, the International Market Analysis Research and Consulting (IMARC) Group found that the global farm equipment rental market size reached $52.4 billion in 2022. Analysts expect the industry to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% over the next five years.\n\nWith more equipment needed in the industry, equipment producers will benefit from increased demand. However, there are risks in the agricultural industry related to crop yields as the changing climate makes weather patterns unpredictable. In addition, more severe weather conditions plague the Midwest, where most of the farming occurs. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there were 55 preliminary tornado reports in February 2023. This is almost double the average from 1991–2010. As severe weather becomes more destructive and unpredictable, farmers are at risk of losing significant amounts of their crops.\n\nUSDA chief economist Seth Meyer believes 2023 will be slower than 2022 for the agriculture industry. Meyer forecasts U.S. agricultural trade exports to be $184.5 billion this year, a decrease of almost $12 billion from 2022. Furthermore, 2023 net cash farm income is forecast to decrease 22.9% from the record high set in 2022.\n\nWhen analyzing a company, it is helpful to have an objective framework that allows you to compare companies in the same way. This is one reason why AAII created the A  Stock Grades, which evaluate companies across five factors that have been shown to identify market-beating stocks in the long run: value, growth, momentum, earnings estimate revisions (and surprises) and quality.\n\nUsing AAII\'s A  Stock Grades, the following table summarizes the attractiveness of three agricultural equipment stocks--AGCO, Deere & Co. and Titan International--based on their fundamentals.\n\nAAII\'s A  Stock Grade Summary for Three Agricultural Equipment Stocks\n\nAmerican Association of Individual Investors\n\nAGCO is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world. It delivers agricultural solutions to farmers through a full line of tractors, combine harvesters, hay and forage equipment, seeding and tillage implements, grain storage and protein production systems, as well as replacement parts. Its brand products include AP, Cimbria, Cumberland, Fella, Fuse, Gleaner, GSI, Precision Planting, Sunflower, Tecno, White Planters, Grain & Protein, AGCO GenuineCare, AGCO Parts, AGCO Power, AGCO Protection, AGCO Service and AGCO Trader. The company\'s tillage and seeding equipment joint venture operates within the North American geographical segment. Its grain storage and protein production systems operate within the Europe/Middle East geographical segment. The Chinese harvesting business operates within the Asia/Pacific/Africa segment.\n\nA higher-quality stock possesses traits associated with upside potential and reduced downside risk. Backtesting of the Quality Grade shows that stocks with higher Quality Grades, on average, outperformed stocks with lower grades over the period from 1998 through 2019.\n\nAGCO has a Quality Grade of A with a score of 84. The A  Quality Grade is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of return on assets (ROA), return on invested capital (ROIC), gross profit to assets, buyback yield, change in total liabilities to assets, accruals to assets, Z double prime bankruptcy risk (Z) score and F-Score. The score is variable, meaning it can consider all eight measures or, should any of the eight measures not be valid, the valid remaining measures. To be assigned a Quality Score, though, stocks must have a valid (non-null) measure and corresponding ranking for at least four of the eight quality measures.\n\nThe company ranks strongly in terms of its return on assets and F-Score. AGCO has a return on assets of 9.0% and an F-Score of 8. AGCO\'s return on assets exceeds the sector median of 3.0% by a significant margin. The return on assets indicates how profitable a company is in relation to total assets. The higher the return on assets, the more efficient and productive a company is at managing its balance sheet to generate profits. The F-Score is a number between zero and nine that assesses the strength of a company\'s financial position. It considers the profitability, leverage, liquidity and operating efficiency of a company. However, the company ranks poorly in terms of its ratio of accruals to assets (net income minus cash divided by total assets), in the 24th percentile.\n\nAGCO is held in the VMQ Stocks model portfolio. The company has an average Momentum Grade of C with a score of 54. AGCO also has a Value Score of 51, which is considered average. The company currently has a shareholder yield of 1.2%.\n\nDeere produces intelligent, connected machines and applications that help the agriculture and construction industries. The company\'s production and precision agriculture segment develops and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton and sugar. The small agriculture and turf segment develops and delivers global equipment and technology solutions for dairy and livestock producers, crop producers and turf and utility customers. The construction and forestry segment develops and delivers a range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry and roadbuilding production systems. The financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used equipment for production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, as well as construction and forestry.\n\nDeere has a Momentum Grade of C, based on its Momentum Score of 53. This means that it ranks in the middle tier of all stocks in terms of its weighted relative strength over the last four quarters. This rank is derived from a high relative price strength of 12.1% and 28.6% in the second-most-recent and third-most-recent quarters, offset by low relative price strengths of –17.0% and –16.9% in the most recent and fourth-most-recent quarters, respectively. The ranks are 33, 78, 90 and 28 sequentially from the most recent quarter. The weighted four-quarter relative price strength is –2.0%, which translates to a rank of 53. The weighted four-quarter relative strength rank is the relative price change for each of the past four quarters, with the most recent quarterly price change given a weight of 40% and each of the three previous quarters given a weighting of 20%.\n\nThe company has a strong Quality Grade of B based on a buyback yield rank of 86. Buyback yield is the repurchase of outstanding shares over the existing market capitalization of a company. It has a 3.2% buyback yield, which is well above the sector median. It also has a strong return on assets with a rank of 86. Its return on assets of 9.3% is over triple the sector median.\n\nDeere has a Value Grade of D, based on its Value Score of 39, which is considered expensive. This is based on a high price-to-book-value (P/B) ratio of 5.31 and a high price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) ratio of 34.0. The company has a very strong Growth Grade of A, with a score of 85. It currently has a dividend yield of 1.3%.\n\nTitan International is a global manufacturer of off-highway wheels, tires, assemblies and undercarriage products. Its segments include agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer. The agricultural segment manufactures wheels, tires and components for use on various agricultural equipment, including tractors, combines, skidders, plows, planters and irrigation equipment. The earthmoving/construction segment manufactures wheels, tires and undercarriage systems and components for various types of off-the-roads (OTR) earthmoving, mining, military, construction and forestry equipment, including skid steers, aerial lifts, cranes, graders and levelers, scrapers, self-propelled shovel loaders, articulated dump trucks, load transporters, haul trucks, backhoe loaders, crawler tractors, lattice cranes, shovels and hydraulic excavators.\n\nTitan International has a Value Grade of A, based on its Value Score of 89 (a higher score being more attractive), which is considered to be deep value.\n\nTitan International\'s Value Score ranking is based on several traditional valuation metrics. The company has a rank of 42 for shareholder yield, 20 for the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio and in 12 for the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. The company has a price-to-sales ratio of 0.30 and a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 5.8. A lower price-to-sales ratio is considered better, and Titan International\'s price-to-sales ratio is well below the sector median of 0.79. The ratio of price to free cash flow (the lower the better) is significantly better than the sector median of 20.1.\n\nThe Value Grade is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of the valuation metrics mentioned above along with the price-to-book ratio, the ratio of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) and the price-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nEarnings estimate revisions offer an indication of how analysts are viewing the short-term prospects of a firm. The company has an Earnings Estimate Revisions Grade of D, which is considered negative. The grade is based on the statistical significance of its latest two quarterly earnings surprises and the percentage change in its consensus estimate for the current fiscal year over the past month and past three months.\n\nThe company reported a negative earnings surprise for fourth-quarter 2022 of –1.1%, and in the prior quarter reported a positive earnings surprise of 11.3%. Over the last three months, the consensus earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2023 has fallen 6.7% to $0.595 per share due to one downward revision.\n\nThe company has a very strong Quality Grade of A based on an F-Score of 8, which is above the sector median. It also has a strong change in total liabilities to assets with a rank of 76. Titan International has a Momentum Score of 34, which is considered weak.\n\nThe stocks meeting the criteria of the approach do not represent a ""recommended"" or ""buy"" list. It is important to perform due diligence.\n\nIf you want an edge throughout this market volatility, become an AAII member. https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2023/04/12/agco-deere-titan-spring-sprung-for-these-three-agricultural-equipment-stocks/"

"Fox News Sanctioned by Judge for Withholding Evidence in Dominion Case The judge overseeing Dominion Voting Systems\' lawsuit against Fox News said on Wednesday that he was imposing a sanction on the network and would very likely start an investigation into whether Fox\'s legal team had withheld evidence, scolding the lawyers for not being ""straightforward"" with him.\n\nThe rebuke came after lawyers for Dominion, which is suing for defamation, revealed a number of instances in which Fox\'s lawyers had not turned over evidence in a timely manner. That evidence included recordings of the Fox News host Maria Bartiromo talking with former President Donald J. Trump\'s lawyers, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, which Dominion said had been turned over only a week ago.\n\nIn imposing sanction on Fox, Judge Eric M. Davis of the Delaware Superior Court ruled that if Dominion had to do additional depositions or redo any already done that ""Fox will do everything they can to make the person available, and it will be at a cost to Fox.""\n\nHe also said he would very likely appoint a special master to investigate Fox\'s handling of discovery of documents and the question of whether Fox had inappropriately withheld details about Rupert Murdoch\'s role as a corporate officer of Fox News. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/business/media/fox-dominion-trial-sanctioned.html"
"It's Tick Time! What To Know About The Growing Risk Of Infections From Ticks A Close Up Of An Adult Female, An Adult Male, Nymph And Larval Deer Tick Is Shown Next To A Paper ... [ ] Clip. Note that some forms can be as small as a poppy or sesame seed (Photo By Getty Images)\n\nThe Northeast and Midwest parts of the country have finally had thaws. With that comes the emergence of ticks. Here\'s what\'s changing in terms of these zoonoses, or animal associated infection.\n\nWith climate change, we\'re seeing a growth in tick-borne diseases and the range of different types of ticks. For example, according to data from insurance companies,  476,000 people are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease in the US each year. Previously thought to be limited to the NE, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Lyme is now also found throughout the Midwest and along the East Coast. Some cases occur in California and the Pacific Northwest as well. Rural Lyme increased 357% from 2007-21. Fragmentation of forested areas also contributes to the expansion of Lyme, as predators for the host white-footed mice decrease.\n\nAntibodies are proteins in the blood that are evidence of past infection. A meta-analysis last year suggests that antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb), the bacteria which causes Lyme, are found in more than 14 percent of the world\'s population, including Europe and eastern Asia.\n\nThere are a growing number of other ticks to worry about, too. For example, anaplasmosis is also transmitted by the black-legged tick ((Ixodes scapularis, or Ixodes pacificus in the west). I learned about this the hard way when I suddenly developed a bad headache, chills, nausea, and achiness while vacationing in Maine. Fortunately, the local doctor I consulted immediately recognized the symptoms as characteristic of anaplasmosis, which he said was common there. He treated me with doxycycline, and I promptly improved. Unfortunately, diagnostic tests for many tick-borne infections are inaccurate, so you need to rely on an astute physician for diagnosis. Only  5600 cases of anaplasmosis were reported in 2019, well behind Lyme.\n\nNext most common are spotted fevers. While known primarily for ""Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,"" this rickettsial infection, transmitted by the dog tick, is seen most in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Deaths occur in 5-10%. Similar spotted fevers are found in the West, and the CDC now groups these illnesses together. There were 5200 reported spotted fever infections 2019. There has been a notable increase in Arizona recently.\n\nBabesiosis is a parasitic infection transmitted by the same black-legged (or deer) tick. In addition to the non-specific flu-like symptoms noted above, Babesia parasites destroy red blood cells, causing a particular type of anemia (hemolytic), jaundice, and dark urine. People with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, loss of spleen, and the elderly are particularly at risk. The parasites can be seen under the microscope, making the diagnosis. Treatment requires a combination of antibiotics.\n\nEhrlichia is transmitted by the Lone Star tick (pic). Cases have risen 10-fold in the past 20 years to  2000/year. Most patients are in SE or South Central US and New York. There are no unique symptoms or timely good tests. Like most tick-borne infections, treatment is with doxycycline.\n\nTularemia, which is transmitted by dog ticks, wood ticks, or lone star ticks, skin contact, or by aerosolizing infection from dead rabbits or landscaping. There is a broad range of symptoms, from ulcers to swollen glands, to pneumonia. Fortunately, it is rare, with 150-250 cases per year. It also requires specific antibiotics and specialist care.\n\nPowassan virus - in the northeast, unique in that the tick only needs to be attached for minutes, rather than hours, to infect a person.\n\nHeartland virus - from Lone Star ticks, in the midwest and south. Rare ( 100 cases total reported). It can cause low white cells and platelets, like Ehrlichia.\n\nSTARI - (Southern tick-associated rash illness) - Lone Star tick. Expanding, Lyme-like rash\n\nRickettsia parkeri - Gulf coast tick, recently spotted in Arizona. It has an eschar (scab), as an early sign. Symptoms are like RMSF except are milder.\n\nTickborne relapsing fever (TBRF), transmitted by soft ticks in the western US and Rocky Mountains. Associated with cabins and vacation homes.\n\n364D rickettsiosis (Rickettsia phillipi) - Pacific Coast tick fever and rickettsialpox are associated with an eschar, or dark scab at the site of tick or mite bite.\n\nIt\'s not just infections you need to worry about with tick bites. Alpha-gal syndrome is a red meat allergy that mostly follows bites from lone star ticks. Symptoms include rash and diarrhea, although they might be more severe.\n\nThe types of infections transmitted by ticks as well as the ranges in which the infections are found are expanding. Most of these infections are rarely seen and might require either an infectious disease specialist or a local physician well-versed in the types of infections seen in his/her region to diagnose them. A careful exposure history must be given by the patient--e.g., hiking, camping, hunting, cleaning where there have been mouse nests, etc.\n\nIn addition to the possibility of meningitis, an unusually severe headache and muscle aches, especially if accompanied by a rash, should prompt consideration of a tick-borne infection. Also, there are other symptoms with some of the less common infections, such as an eschar, that are important clues.\n\nMany of the ticks that transmit infections like Lyme are tiny, only the size of a poppy seed or sesame seed. So the best way of preventing these illnesses to to take preventive measures, which will be reviewed in an upcoming post. https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2023/04/12/its-tick-time-what-to-know-about-the-growing-risk-of-infections-from-ticks/"
"The Perils In Court For The So-Called ""Self-Represented"" scale balanced and unbalanced on white background\n\nSelf Represented is NOT Represented\n\nIn 2021, the Washington Post published a 5 part editorial board opinion series, ""Alone Before the Law"" in which the authors addressed the difficulty for litigants who appear in court without attorneys in civil cases and the misnomer ""self-represented."" This subtle shift in legal lingo seeped its way into some courthouses in recent years, throwing a veil of obfuscation over a toxic threat to justice.\n\nLitigants who cannot afford a lawyer in civil procedures, including victims of domestic violence desperate for restraining orders that might protect them from abusive partners, are now often called ""self-represented."" That\'s a misnomer. In fact, they are unrepresented -- they have no legal right to court-appointed counsel -- and the consequences may be deadly.\n\nLitigants with attorneys in domestic violence cases are far more likely to obtain a protective order than those without an attorney\n\nIt is roughly estimated that well over 1 million Americans, mostly women, seek restraining orders annually. In most cases, these women cannot afford to hire a lawyer producing severely skewed outcomes. In a 1999 to 2000 survey, just 36 of 205 women sampled in Baltimore, MD had a lawyer when they sought a civil protection order. Of those 36 women, 30 got the protection they sought, while just a third of the other 169 women, unrepresented by counsel, were successful.\n\nA study showed that more than 80 percent of survivors were granted protective orders in court when they had lawyers arguing their cases; those without lawyers were successful just a third of the time.\n\n""There\'s a lack of understanding about how intimidating it can be to stand in a courtroom, period, let alone next to the person you\'re fearful of,"" Connecticut State Senator Mae Flexer, quoted in Alone Before the Law, Washington Post Opinion Piece, June 13, 2021.\n\nLitigants in child custody cases don\'t hire attorneys because of several factors\n\nIn the 2016 Cases Without Counsel (CWC), report on experiences of self-representation in U.S. Family Court report prepared by the University of Denver with a grant from the Institute for Advancement of the American legal System (IAALS), the reasons given to proceed unrepresented in child custody proceedings included: financial issues, assessment of one\'s ability to self-represent, a preference for self-representing and experience with and their perception of attorneys. Finances were cited in 90% of the decisions to self-represent.\n\nLitigants without attorneys in family court, expressed sentiments like:\n\n""Maybe I should get an attorney, because I don\'t know how to cross-examine,"" a mother facing the loss of custody of her twins said in court, where she was flustered to find herself face-to-face with the boys\' relatively well-off aunt and uncle, who did have an attorney. The presiding magistrate ignored her request, which had been previously denied by a judge. (Ohio)\n\n""If you were going on a trip, you would get a map and you would know where you were going. You would have a destination. You would know the route you were taking. The most stressful part is that I didn\'t really have an understanding of that until almost the end of the process.""\n\n""It felt very much like wandering through a room with no lights on, and you\'d bump into something, you\'d ask somebody about it, and they\'d shine a little flashlight and say, \'go that way.\'…Nobody ever turned the lights on in the whole room to give us an idea of exactly what it should look like and how the process should look.""\n\nAttorney vs no attorney in Child Custody cases result in cases being less likely to settle and litigants being less satisfied with the result of the litigation\n\nIn a report compiled by CustodyXChange.com with a 4% margin of error, their study showed that parents were most likely to settle and to share custody, when both had attorneys. Eighty-six percent of cases with both parents represented reached a settlement, which courts and legal experts consider the ideal outcome for most families. On the other hand, only 63 percent of cases with one attorney and 71 percent of cases with no attorneys reached settlement.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the National Center State Courts public opinion survey respondents (91%) agreed with the sentiment: ""You are more likely to win [sic] court with a lawyer by your side."" Indeed, some of the relevant literature suggests there are valid reasons to think that representation status affects the fairness of the process. In a 2009 ABA survey of state trial judges, 62% of respondents reported that self-represented litigants are negatively impacted and that outcomes are worse for these individuals than their counterparts with representation\n\nIs free legal representation or assistance available in the United States?\n\nWhile in the United States everyone has the right to an attorney in a criminal case and this right often extends to a family law case where a parent faces incarceration, and states receiving federal child abuse prevention and treatment funding must appoint a representative for children involved in abuse and neglect proceedings, few states provide attorneys at no cost in family law child custody cases. Louisiana will provide free counsel if there is an allegation of emotional, physical or sexual abuse of a child. Massachusetts will do so ""in the interests of justice"". New York guarantees a right to counsel if financially qualified in a child custody proceeding. Oregon provides a right to counsel for a child in a contested custody proceeding.\n\nOther resources may be available on a state by sate basis but in most states the options are slim to none for representation in the family courts as a matter of right.\n\nAccording to US News and World Reports, May 2022, if you can\'t afford an attorney, the strategies to try are:\n\nScoping out these resources requires some amount of luck and forbearance. Some courthouses have a Help Center and/or law library for public use where you can obtain legal information. Searching online can provide attorneys who offer free consultations. Court websites may have forms available online for filing petitions. Some law schools have legal clinics where law students work with seasoned attorneys on specific types of cases. Some bar associations have help or referral lines.\n\nLack of representation results in a pervasive sense of unfairness in the judicial system\n\nThe Cases Without Counsel (CWC) study narratives highlight a host of nuanced issues that, taken together, suggest that feelings of being at a disadvantage or concerns with respect to fairness were relatively common among self-represented litigant study participants. A considerable proportion of CWC self-represented litigant participants did not feel as if the process was fair or afforded them equal standing with represented parties. It is easy to imagine that, for these individuals, their vision of the court system becomes one of distrust and dissatisfaction.\n\nThe Washington Post Opinion piece, ""Alone Before the Law"" series perhaps expresses it best in the first article of their series, February 26, 2021, ""You can lose your kids, home and freedom without ever seeing a lawyer. It\'s a profound injustice.""\n\nHow can justice for all occur without legal representation?\n\nThe simple answer is, it cannot. Without legal representation victims of domestic violence, litigants in child custody disputes and domestic violence cases, tenants facing eviction in housing court and litigants in divorces entitled to child support and other financial renumeration can lose-their freedom, their child, their home, their property and support.\n\nIn New York City, there is a ""right to counsel"" law that provides tenants in housing court a free attorney. There is an 18b panel of attorneys that can be appointed for financially qualified litigants in child custody cases. It is not perfect. These attorneys are underpaid. There is a shortage of attorneys who volunteer to be on the 18b panel.\n\nThe Women\'s Bar Association in New York County sponsors the Matrimonial Pro Bono Project in which experienced matrimonial attorneys volunteer their time to represent unrepresented litigants in financial matters who appear in court in a divorce.\n\nIt is a start towards providing ""justice"" for all. Other states should model New York\'s examples of providing attorneys for litigants in housing court, family court and divorce cases. https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciafersch/2023/04/12/the-perils-in-court-for-the-so-called-self-represented/"
"HBO Max Will Relaunch in May as Max for the Same Monthly Price     - CNET HBO Max as we know it is changing.\n\nApril marks one year since the merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery. Last year, the new Warner Bros. Discovery promised to introduce by summer 2023 a revamped streaming service that combines content from HBO Max and Discovery Plus, and the rebranded platform now has a name: Max.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced the name Wednesday during a virtual press event, along with the tagline, ""The One to Watch."" Global streaming boss JB Perrette said the new streaming service will roll out in the US on May 23. Viewers in Latin America will get Max this fall, with Europe, Asia and other markets to follow in 2024.\n\nMax will stick with HBO Max\'s current price plans at $10 per month for the ad-supported subscription, $16 monthly for ad-free with two streams, and a new, ad-free $20 ""Ultimate"" option that features four concurrent streams and 4K content.\n\nSubscription plans for Max streaming service.\n\nSince the current version of HBO Max includes 4K and three streams in the $16 ad-free tier, the new plan structure amounts to a $4 price hike for viewers who want the higher image quality of 4K and the ability to watch on more than two devices at the same time.\n\nDiscovery Plus will remain a standalone streaming option priced at $5 per month for the ad-supported plan and $7 monthly for the ad-free version. The platform houses a variety of reality shows, sports and infotainment from more than 20 networks such as TLC, HGTV, Food Network and Animal Planet.\n\nHBO Max began adding Discovery Plus titles to its platform in September. Viewers are able to stream shows like Fixer Upper from Chip and Joanna Gaines\' Magnolia Network empire as well as other Discovery-branded fare like Maine Cabin Masters and Trixie Motel. Though HBO Max is no stranger to the world of unscripted TV, the addition of niche content from Discovery\'s portfolio caters to audiences with an appetite for nonfiction.\n\nChief Content Officer Kathleen Finch spoke about the slew of new original releases coming to Max, including reality series Barbie\'s Dreamhouse Challenge, TinyToons Looniversity and Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai. The company is building out universes for The Conjuring, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and The Big Bang Theory with a slate of new projects. More 90 Day Fiance and Magnolia series are also in the pipeline.\n\nIn the last 12 months, WBD made significant programming changes to HBO Max under the leadership of Zaslav, a Discovery veteran. More than six dozen movies and TV shows have been canceled, licensed out or removed from the platform altogether, included scripted favorites like Westworld and reality series such as Craftopia. Some projects -- such as Batgirl and Scoob! Holiday Haunt -- were scrapped as a cost-cutting measure. Ahead of both streamers\' catalogs consolidating, Discovery Plus lost a handful of titles too, including House Haunters and Love in the Jungle.\n\nCompared to rivals Paramount and Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery is taking a different route with its two services. Paramount Plus folded Showtime content into its app and offers the combined version as a premium bundle, with standalone options still currently available. The company also rebranded Showtime\'s linear cable channel as ""Paramount Plus with Showtime,"" which airs content from both brands. Though Disney Plus and Hulu remain separate streaming platforms, they can be bundled in three packages. Some Disney-owned titles are available to stream on both services at the same time.\n\nSince taking the reins, Zaslav has been eyeing Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon\'s Prime Video as top competitors in the streaming business. During his 2021 keynote speech at the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference, he described the prospect of a unified Discovery Plus/Warner offering as ""complete"" and ""competitive with Netflix and Disney.""\n\nWhen discussing the launch of Max today, Zaslav said ""Max is the one to watch"" for its navigation capabilities, content and global reach. https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/hbo-max-will-relaunch-in-may-as-max-for-same-monthly-price/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"Searching For The Next Big Thing In Crypto What should a crypto investor look for?\n\nI don\'t often sing the praises of specific stocks or cryptos because I prefer to talk about macro trends. This is because any fool can make money if they pick the direction correctly and it takes a genius to make profits when the general market is running against their specific position. As we all experienced, even total novices can make a lot of money long in a raging bull and few of us have been covering ourselves in glory being long in the bear market of the Federal Reserve tightening environment.\n\nIf you want to be long-only then the are only a few things you can do in a bear market:\n\n2) Dollar cost average through the bear in anticipation for sunnier days ahead.\n\n3) Be incredibly selective, bordering on option 1.\n\n4) Invest in special situations you are completely comfortable getting embroiled in.\n\nWith this in mind I am buying a crypto with numbers 2, 3 and perhaps 4.\n\nSo let\'s start with the macro position.\n\nFor me this is the set up:\n\n1) The U.S. is going to try and shutter crypto by using the techniques of ""Operation Choke Point."" This amounts to making crypto business impossible in the format that has brought it success. You can wiki the original Choke Point and you will see the very obvious similarities. It is going to be close whether the U.S. follows China\'s lead and pulls off crippling crypto V1.\n\n2) Crypto cannot be un-invented and in any event will morph. V1 leads to V2, etc.\n\n3) The digital world will have digital currency and it will be crypto, be it public or private sector.\n\n4) There will be wave after wave of crypto-enabled products that will become extremely valuable.\n\n5) Investing in crypto-enabled projects is high risk but extremely high reward.\n\n6) Project picking is key to investment success.\n\nAs for us, number 6 is the one that is important. There is no point in being Nostradamus if you don\'t lay your money down.\n\nFirst let me state, investing is NOT trading. Riding a pump and dump or a mania is not investing. Picking the next moon is not investing. Buying bitcoin bitcoin and hodling is investing, but buying and selling dogecoin dogecoin on the back of tweets is not.\n\nSo what should a crypto investor look for?\n\n1) A product that exists.\n\n2) A product that has a great business model.\n\n3) An established product that is seasoned with use and has thus demonstrated its security.\n\n4) A product that is getting an audience that uses it.\n\n5) A product with an established team.\n\n6) A project with limited risk of token dilution.\n\n7) A project with a non-stratospheric ""real world"" valuation.\n\n8) A project you use and appreciate.\n\nThis is where my crypto tip comes in. The following crypto project fits those criteria: Presearch (PRE).\n\nI am slowly buying Presearch tokens. It is a crypto Adwords-style system. It ticks for me all the above boxes.\n\n1) A product that exists.\n\na. It exists and is operational: www.presearch.com.\n\n2) A product that has a great business model.\n\na. It\'s a crypto Google GOOG AdWords clone. Google   crypto.\n\n3) An established product that is seasoned with use and has thus demonstrated its security.\n\na. It\'s been out there for a long time.\n\n4) A product that is getting an audience that uses it.\n\na. It\'s hard to trust PR numbers, but you can see a good cohort of ""advertisers.""\n\n5) A product with an established team.\n\na. They have been going for years.\n\n6) A project with limited risk of token dilution.\n\na. 400 million of a total 500 million tokens are out there.\n\n7) A project with a non-stratospheric \'real world\' valuation.\n\na. $34 million is chump change in the scheme of things.\n\n8) A project you use and appreciate.\n\na. I use the search engine that pays me a bit of money and advertises staking the project\'s tokens, currently for free, but would happily pay for clicks like millions do with Google.\n\nPaying searchers is clearly a massive draw in due course (I\'ve made $3), which amounts to probably $100 a year and I use the search engine instead of Google because it is generally good enough and $100 is $100!\n\nOn the other side of the equation, it is not charging for clicks yet in Presearch tokens but it surely will and I\'d happily pay as I have already got clicks to my sites worth probably $100 and I do not see its clicks being any less worthy than Google\'s click fraud-mired traffic.\n\nNow considering this is a working Google clone that pays searchers and will soon enter a business that Google makes the best part of $200 billion a year and has a market cap of $1.3 trillion (or as I like to think of it $1.3 million, million) then Presearch\'s market cap may as well be $0 in comparison.\n\nI\'m not suggesting this project will surpass Google or even put a dent in it. I\'m not suggesting it will succeed even. However, this is exactly the sort of project that will have a crack at the big time in the way that the survivors of the 2000 dotcom crash winter had a chance to became titans.\n\nSo while the U.S. plays wack-a-mole with cryptocurrencies, this is where I\'ll be looking, because ultimately it is ""use-cases"" that will determine the long-term success of crypto.\n\nDisclosure: I own presearch tokens. https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/12/searching-for-the-next-big-thing-in-crypto/"
"InMode Soars On Bullish Pre-Announcement -- But There's A Slight Caveat Medical aesthetics company InMode (INMD) preannounced better-than-expected first-quarter sales and profits on Wednesday, pushing INMD stock closer to a breakout.\n\nFor the three months that ended March 31, InMode expects sales to land between $105.7 million and $105.9 million. That\'s above forecasts for $100.3 million, Needham analyst Mike Matson said in a note to clients. It implies sales grew about 23% year over year.\n\nThe company also called for adjusted earnings of 50- to 51-cents per share, above analyst forecasts for 46 cents, he said. Earnings grew roughly 26% to 29%, he said.\n\nIn afternoon trading on today\'s stock market, INMD stock surged 8.3% near 38. Shares are closing in on a buy point at 41.94 out of a flat base, according to MarketSmith.com.\n\nInMode sells minimally invasive tools that use radio frequency to remodel how the body stores fat. The company also offers skin-tightening procedures and has branched into gynecological services.\n\nMatson notes InMode didn\'t update its full-year outlook. Previously, the company projected $525 million to $530 million in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.58-$2.60 per share. Sales would jump 16%-17% as earnings increase 6%-7%. Both pieces of guidance topped INMD stock analysts\' consensus forecasts.\n\nHe expects InMode to boost its full-year guidance on the first-quarter earnings call, slated for May 2.\n\nBut Matson kept his hold rating on INMD stock.\n\n""Despite the strong first-quarter results, we remain concerned that a slowing economy will reduce demand for high-priced aesthetic procedures and cause InMode\'s revenue growth to slow,"" he said.\n\nStill, InMode shares remain highly rated. INMD stock has a Composite Rating of 97, which puts it among the top 3% of all stocks when it comes to fundamental and technical measures.\n\nThe stock\'s EPS Rating, a measure of profitability on a 1-to-99 scale, is a 98. Shares have a lower Relative Strength Rating of 80.

"Rare New Jersey Wildfire Burns Nearly 4,000 Acres--And East Coast Fires May Become More Common A devastating wildfire that started Tuesday night in a heavily forested section of southern New Jersey has spread to nearly 4,000 acres, state officials said Wednesday, marking an unusually large East Coast wildfire, which scientists believe are becoming more frequent as climate change brings more frequent droughts.\n\nA wildfire in southern New Jersey has burned roughly 4,000 acres, and scientists warn fires on the ... [ ] East Coast could become more common.\n\nThe fire in Manchester Township, New Jersey--roughly 50 miles east of Philadelphia--spread to 3,859 acres and is 50% contained, the state\'s Forest Fire Service announced in an update Wednesday.\n\nThe fire, called the Jimmy\'s Waterhole Fire, has threatened 20 buildings, and led officials to close several roads and issue evacuation orders affecting 170 homes in the rural town (no deaths or injuries have been reported as a result of the fire).\n\nNew Jersey State Parks Commissioner John Cecil told local ABC affiliate ABC7 the fire carried 200-foot flames as officials worked to put it out Tuesday night and Wednesday morning--marking a rare fire in a state that typically does not see the kind of devastating wildfires that have become increasingly common on the West Coast and the Rocky Mountains.\n\nScientists, however, believe dry conditions made worse by climate change will likely cause East Coast wildfires, particularly in the Northeast, to escalate in heavily forested areas, which have historically been protected by wetter weather patterns. That\'s because drought conditions are expected to become more frequent, with longer dry stretches between heavy rainfall events, even as scientists say climate change will bring more rain to the Northeast over the course of a given year (southern New Jersey is facing abnormally dry conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor). Scientists also believe the effects of long-term exposure to wildfire smoke will harm more people in the eastern U.S. than the western part of the country, largely due to higher populations in the East and the ability of smoke to spread thousands of miles from its source, according to a 2021 study in the journal GeoHealth.\n\nNew Jersey\'s Pine Barrens, the rural stretch of forestland in the southern part of the state where the Jimmy\'s Waterhole Fire is burning, was also the site of the largest wildfire in New Jersey history, which consumed more than 183,000 acres and caused roughly $8.5 million in property losses almost exactly 60 years ago. Another 11,000 acres of the state\'s Pine Barrens burned in April 2019. The fire comes in the middle of an early-season warm streak throughout the Midwest and East Coast, bringing temperatures into the mid-80s this week and potentially breaking daily heat records in several cities, including New York City. The National Weather Service has issued a ""special weather statement"" for the entire state of New Jersey, as well as in Delaware and eastern Maryland, warning low humidity, gusty winds and dry conditions will increase the risk of wildfire.\n\nThe NWS\'s special weather statement extends into southern New York, Ohio, and parts of Georgia, Indiana, Illinois and Virginia, while the agency has also warned of ""critical fire weather conditions"" in lower New England, Pennsylvania, northern Maryland, and across the Midwest and Great Plains, including from Michigan to eastern Colorado. The weather service\'s Chicago and Milwaukee branches have both warned strong winds could cause ""rapid spread"" of fires.\n\nHeat Records Expected To Fall Across Midwest, Northeast This Week--Here\'s Where It Will Be Hottest (Forbes) https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/04/12/rare-new-jersey-wildfire-burns-nearly-4000-acres-and-east-coast-fires-may-become-more-common/"
"American Views Of China Worsen; Distrust Of Its Social Media Platforms Is Widespread -- Pew Research Nearly nine-in-ten Americans surveyed in a new Pew Research Center poll said they have little or no ... [ ] confidence in China\'s social media companies to follow what their privacy policies say they will do with personal information. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nUnfavorable views of China held by Americans have worsened in the past year, according to a new poll released today by the Pew Research Center that focuses on China.\n\nSome 83% of U.S. adults have negative views of China, up from 82% a year ago, Pew said. The share with ""very unfavorable"" views increased by four percentage points from a year ago to 44%, the center said.\n\nAmericans broadly distrust Chinese social media companies, which as a group rank among the world\'s largest. ""Nearly nine-in-ten (88%) said they have little or no confidence in them to follow what their privacy policies say they will do with personal information, including 59% who say they have no confidence at all,"" Pew found.\n\nThat skepticism underlies support by more than two-to-one a U.S. government ban on TikTok, Pew said. ""This support is related to views on China: Those who are aware that the app\'s parent company, ByteDance, is located in China and those who have unfavorable views of the country are much more likely to support a ban of the social media platform,"" Pew found.\n\nAround four-in-10 Americans now see China as an enemy of the U.S., rather than a competitor or partner, up by 13 percentage points from a year ago, Pew found. Just 14% of those polled had a positive view of China – the lowest share recorded since the Pew survey switched to an online panel in 2005, Pew said today.\n\nOlder Americans have more negative views of China than younger ones: 91% of those ages 65 and older say they have an unfavorable opinion, compared with 75% of those 18 to 29, Pew said in the new survey. Although older Americans\' negative feelings of China have remained largely unchanged in recent years, younger adults have turned more negative over the past two years, increasing from 68% to 75% unfavorable, it said.\n\n""People are broadly concerned about China\'s role in the world, both geopolitically and in terms of specific issues,"" Pew said.\n\n""For example, in the wake of Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s recent visit to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, 62% of Americans see the China-Russia partnership as a very serious problem for the U.S., up five points since October and back to the original high levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the Ukraine invasion in 2022,"" it said.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin talk to each other prior ... [ ] to Chinese President Xi Jinping leaving after their dinner at The Palace of the Facets in the Moscow Kremlin, Russia, Tuesday, March 21, 2023. (Grigory Sysoyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)\n\nA growing share of Americans are concerned about tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, Pew said. Nearly half of U.S. adults (47%) say tensions between the two are a very serious problem for the U.S., up 19 points since February 2021. China this month conducted military exercises around Taiwan this month following a meeting between Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Taipei said today Beijing declared a ""no-fly zone"" in a busy transportation corridor north of Taiwan this Sunday (see post here).\n\nThe latest Pew poll out today about American views of China comes on the heels of a Pew survey released earlier this month that found about two-thirds – 65% -- of Americans either ""not too confident"" or ""not at all confident"" in President Joe Biden\'s ability to deal effectively with China. Some 37% expressed no confidence at all; 28% said they were not too confident.\n\nNevertheless, Americans were 10 percentage points more likely in the new poll to call the U.S. the world\'s leading economic power than China, a significant change from last year when the two were seen as equally powerful, Pew said. China\'s GDP growth last year slid in connection with its ""zero-Covid"" policies.\n\nAsked who benefits most from U.S.-China trade – the U.S., China, both countries or neither – nearly half of Americans (47%) say China benefits more. Only 7% think the U.S. benefits most, according to Pew. Under a quarter of Americans (23%) said that both countries benefit equally. Amid conflict over trade in semiconductors, Beijing earlier this month announced a cybersecurity review of U.S. chipmaker Micron aimed protecting the country\'s information infrastructure and national security. (See related post here.) More optimistically, Elon Musk\'s Tesla over the weekend announced a new plant in Shanghai.\n\nWhen asked about five possible areas for cooperation between the U.S. and China, Americans expressed skepticism about partnering on most, Pew said. ""Americans are more likely than not to say the U.S. and China cannot work together to resolve international conflicts (54%) or cooperate on climate change policy (52%),"" it found. ""The U.S. and China previously issued a joint climate agreement in 2021, and climate talks between the two countries resumed late last year after being suspended over Nancy Pelosi\'s visit to Taiwan.""\n\nRepublicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party are more likely to hold an unfavorable opinion of China (89%) than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (81%). U.S. adults with a college degree or higher education (87%) are also more likely to have an unfavorable opinion of China than those with only some college or less (82%).\n\nFor the poll, Pew from March 20-26, 2023 surveyed 3,576 adult members of its American Trends Panel, an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories, Pew said.\n\nMicron Probe May Hurt China\'s Efforts To Attract Foreign Investment\n\nMore Than Half Of Americans Lack Confidence In Biden Ability To Deal Effectively With China -- Pew Research\n\nU.S. Businesses Look To De-Risk, Not Decouple, Their China Ties\n\nU.S.-China Collaboration Could Cut Development Time, Cost For New Cancer Treatments https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2023/04/12/american-views-of-china-worsen-distrust-of-its-social-media-platforms-is-widespread---pew-research/"

"Visit London During King Charles' Coronation: What To Know, Where To Go (To Avoid Or Join The Crowds) King Charles III will be crowned King officially on 6 May 2023--here's how to join in or successfully ... [ ] avoid the crowds\n\nKing Charles III will have his official coronation in May 2023 in London. Here's everything you need to know to visit London, either to avoid or to join the crowds.\n\nWhilst Charles officially acceded to the throne after the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022, there is always an official investiture inside the cathedral of Westminster Abbey, in the same square as Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster (the latter is home to the British government).\n\nWestminster Abbey has played a crucial role in both Scottish and English royal families since 1066--since this time, 39 coronations have taken place here and it's where 18 monarchs are buried, including Queen Elizabeth 1, as well as other notable figures such as Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nThe ceremony will start at 11 a.m. British Standard Time (6 a.m. EST) on Saturday 6 May.\n\nIn short, it isn't necessary as Charles was already pronounced King when his mother died and Edward VIII never even had a coronation.\n\nHowever, a coronation is a deeply symbolic moment for the church and marks a symbolic passing of powers from one monarch to the next--the ceremony is conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is the leader of the Church of England.\n\nThe ceremony has not changed much in 1,000 years and in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned, it was televised for the first time and watched by 27 million people in the U.K. alone.\n\nIn the U.K. the coronation plans have been given the code name Operation Golden Orb.\n\nKing Charles has asked for a far smaller service than his mother had, so instead of her 5-mile procession to Westminster Abbey, his will run just 1.3 miles (2.3 km).\n\nIt will leave Buckingham Palace, travel down the Mall, run through Admiralty Arch and past Trafalgar Square. Then it will turn down Whitehall, move along Parliament Street, head into Parliament Square, through Broad Sanctuary and arrive at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe return will take the same route, so it is expected that people will camp out on the streets to stake a place with a good enough vantage point for both the outgoing and return journeys. There will also be the usual balcony appearance after the events at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe guest list will be made up of around 2,000 people, a much smaller amount than for Queen Elizabeth, including foreign dignitaries, celebrities and the British Royal family (including Prince Harry, without Meghan and the children). As this is a state event, it is the government that decides who attends.\n\nThere are several parts to the service, including the oath, the investiture and the enthronement. Interestingly for Charles, the Holy Oil that the Archbishop uses to annoint King Charles, will not contain any animal products and there are 12 newly-commissioned pieces of music. Queen Consort Camilla's grandchildren and King Charles' grandson, Prince George, will be pages.\n\nThe First Lady Jill Biden will be representing the U.S.--in the history of the country, no sitting President has attended a British coronation.\n\nRegardless of whether Londoners are royalists or republicans, the mood will be buoyant--a public holiday has been declared for Monday 8 May, bars are allowed to stay open an extra two hours on both the Friday and Saturday nights and there will undoubtedly be street parties.\n\nIndeed, the large U.K. charity, The Big Lunch based at The Eden Project, is encouraging people to come together to organise lots of street parties. There is also a national day of volunteering scheduled for Monday 8 May across the country--sign up here if you want to help a U.K. organisation on this day.\n\nThere will be a big concert taking place in Windsor (outside London) on Sunday 7 May in the evening to commemorate the event and that will be livestreamed on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio 2 and BBC Sounds.\n\nIt might be difficult to avoid the crowds of general feeling of goodwill but there are several new and interesting exhibitions to take in, some of which have royal themes.\n\nThere's Crown to Couture at Kensington Palace, a retrospective of regal fashion throughout the years, or Style and Society: Dressing the Georgians at the Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace.\n\nIf history is more your thing than fashion, the Yeoman Warden tour at The Tower of London takes visitors through the fascinating 1000-year history of the iconic building, where many enemies of Kings and Queen met their fate.\n\nFor anyone deciding not to brave the crowds, it will be shown on the BBC (which U.S. watchers can access via Britbox). https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2023/04/12/visit-london-during-king-charles-coronation-what-to-know-where-to-go-to-avoid-or-join-the-crowds/"
"The 8 Best Sunglasses For Fishing To Protect Your Eyes On The Water There's nothing worse than fishing for hours, only to realize every cast counts for nothing because, as it just so happens, the area is lacking in fish. Truth be told, the best sunglasses for fishing could help you sight fish in moments like these, and save your eyes along the way. Fish are pretty adept at blending into their environment, and a pair of polarized sunglasses will help you differentiate a log from a lunker. But selecting a single pair of fishing sunglasses from hundreds of styles isn't easy--you've got variables to consider, from frame styles to lens tints. That's why we've taken the time to test out an array of fishing sunglasses before hooking the best options for 2023.\n\nToss on the best sunglasses for fishing to see every catch clearly.\n\nThe best sunglasses for fishing overall--the Costa Jose Pro sunglasses--are something of a crowd-pleaser thanks to their scratch-proof, polarized lenses, but we've gone beyond the best-sellers. You'll also find our favorite extra-large sunglasses for fishing, the Smith Guide's Choice XL, our favorite budget pair (the Eddie Bauer Storm) and more.\n\nIf you're fishing for a new pair of sunglasses in the future, be sure to revisit this guide. We rely on a team of diehard anglers and experts who have spent time evaluating dozens of shades over the last decade, and we're continuously updating this information as we check out the latest models.\n\nFit: Regular   Frame Material: Plastic   UV Protection: Yes   Protective Case Included: Yes\n\nIf you haven't yet heard of Costa, just know that this Florida-based company is dedicated to all-things open water. Realistically, Costa makes frames for any and all conditions you can think of, but the Jose Pro--named after legendary angler Jose Wejebe--is Costa's updated take on the classic Jose sunglasses.\n\nThe Pro's aim is at anglers looking to reduce unwanted fog and sweat buildup while keeping their frames firmly on their face in all fishing conditions. The shades come with premium, polarized 580 lenses that are scratch-proof and promise 100% UV protection for any angler's eyes. The temples feature a Hydrolite material that gets more sticky when wet to keep the lenses in place as you haul in a big one. And the Jose Pro is 20% lighter and 22% thinner than the average pair of polarized sunglasses, which means you'll barely notice them on your face while spotting fish in the water.\n\nFit: Extra large   Frame Material: Evolve plastic   UV Protection: Yes   Protective Case Included: Yes\n\nSmith is often associated with ski and snowboard goggles, but the adventure sports brand is no stranger to fishing. In fact, Smith has been a go-to option for anglers thanks to their ChromaPop polarized glass lenses that reduce the glare on the water and help illuminate fish for easy sight fishing. The Guide's Choice XL is a great option for all those anglers who want full-face frame coverage without the headache that comes from a pair that's a tad bit too small.\n\nThe XL frames are 20% larger than the original Guide's Choice, which is Smith's best-seller for water sports. These 8-base frames come with two options for ChromaPop lenses and are sure to block sun and glare while fishing no matter the time of day. The frames come with Megol nose and temple pads as well as spring hinges to help the frames stay put. And to ensure you don't lose them in the water, the Guide's Choice XL comes with an integrated leash. For those who need smaller frames, Smith does offer a Guide's Choice S variant that's 20% smaller than the original.\n\nFit: Regular   Frame Material: Plastic   UV Protection: Yes\n\nWhen anglers aren't scanning the water for fish, they're often tying little knots or staring at a screen in the hopes of finding a honey hole. New for 2023, Bajio premiered the Toad sunglasses that take different tasks into account, including those that require you to focus on objects only inches from your face.\n\nBuilt to order, Bajio Toads are fully customizable and sustainably created using a plant-based nylon material that's plenty durable for open-water tasks. The Toads come in green mirrors, blue mirrors, rose mirrors and gray, so there's plenty of colors to choose from. Anglers can also get magnification powers of  1.50,  2.00 and  2.50. The lenses feature Bajio's special Lapis technology that reduces blue light from the sun to improve clarity, reduce blur and take a little strain off your eyes. The lightweight Toads also employ an 8-base wrap and ergo rubber nose pads, so they sit comfortably on your face for hours at a time.\n\nFit: Large, Extra large   Frame Material: Plastic   UV Protection: Yes   Protective Case Included: Yes\n\nWhy buy a bunch of different sunglasses for different lighting conditions when you can buy just one and swap out lenses? Tifosi's Amok sport sunglasses feature interchangeable, scratch-resistant lenses, so you can swap them out at a moment's notice depending on the day's conditions. The frames come in a variety of vibrant and subdued colors, including Race Neon, Matte Black and Race Red, so you're sure to find a pair that compliments your on-water kit.\n\nThe Amok's lenses provide great polarized protection that's ideal for river and lake fishing, and the frames have a full wrap to protect your eyes from every angle, but come with vents for airflow to prevent fogging. The frames also feature an adjustable nose piece with hydrophilic pads that get grippier when wetr. At only $70, anglers get a lot for their money with the Amok.\n\nFit: Large, Extra large   Frame Material: Recycled plastic, grass   UV Protection: Yes   Protective Case Included: Yes\n\nWhen you consider the fact that fishing is dependent on a healthy environment that's suitable for fish, it comes as no surprise that anglers tend to care deeply about the environments and waterways they use to recreate. To further support that frame of mind, you can pick up the Zeal Optics Cumulus sunglasses knowing they're a sustainable buy that's easy on the same environments you love.\n\nPart of Zeal's See Grass collection, the Cumulus' frames are made of 70% recycled plastic and 30% agricultural waste grass, and their lenses are made of castor beans, making these sunglasses 100% environmentally friendly. It doesn't hurt that they're also stylish--the wayfarer-esque profile comes in four different frame-lens combinations, some of which are subtle and others, vibrant.\n\nFit: Regular   Frame Material: Plastic   UV Protection: Yes   Protective Case Included: Yes\n\nThe polarized Eddie Bauer Storm sunglasses will cost you less than a tank of gas these days, which means you can save your money for other gear, from fishing rods to kayaks. At $59, the Storm shades may even be a steal considering they offer UV-A and UV-B sun protection along with a glare-free view of the water. The lenses come with a hydrophobic coating and include rubber nose pads for a comfortable, secure fit, and the package includes a carrying case. They come in black or brown lenses and will keep your eyes safe from the sun, whether you're on the water or walking around town.\n\nFit: Regular   Frame Material: Plastic   UV Protection: Yes   Protective Case Included: Yes\n\nFor fishing enthusiasts who want a quality pair of shades without breaking the bank, the KastKing Skidaway sunglasses will give other budget-minded buys a run for their money. For the price of a casual dinner, these shades provide polarized lenses that reduce glare from the water surface, allowing anglers to see fish more clearly and make accurate casts. The lenses are impact-resistant, and the frame is made of lightweight and sturdy Grilamid material, providing comfort for long hours of wear. They may not win many awards, but you won't find a more capable pair of shades for less. And if you're still not convinced, just know that these sunglasses have a 4.5/5-star rating on Amazon with over 8,000 reviews, so we're not just out here blowing smoke.\n\nFit: Asian fit   Frame Material: Plastic   UV Protection: Yes   Protective Case Included: Yes\n\nThese days, sunglass companies are designing more Asian Fit sunglasses that are specifically designed for low-bridge noses that traditional frames tend to slide off of throughout the day. The Maui Jim Red Sands is named in honor of Red Sand Beach on Kaihalulu Bay and, like the beach, the Hawaii Lava red mirror-coated lenses stand out on the water (should you opt for the flashy style).

"'Foul Play' Mixes Murder Mysteries, Broadway Stars In Novel Online Interactive Series (Image courtesy of Foul Play)\n\nThe new interactive online series Foul Play came, as often has happened the past couple of years, from a bored creative mind whiling away the hours of the pandemic lockdown, trying to come up with a way to tell stories that didn\'t rely on traditional ways of staging those stories.\n\nThe result this time is a new kind of interactive experience, a string of original murder mysteries in the tradition of Agatha Christie, shot with a large cast of improvisatory actors on a dozen cameras simultaneously in four connected rooms. Though the episodes are recorded and will be available for multiple viewings afterward, a ""live"" component during each episode\'s initial debut is designed to add urgency to online sleuths trying to solve the case.\n\n""The point wasn\'t to make a technology that didn\'t exist before,"" said creator and star Andrew Barth Feldman, best known for his work on Disney  show High School Musical: The Musical: The Series and in Broadway musicals such as Dear Evan Hansen. ""The point was how do we make a digital murder mystery.""\n\nAnd it\'s not Feldman\'s first involvement with a different kind of storytelling. During the lockdown, he was part of Ratatouille the TikTok Musical, a benefit online concert inspired by a TikTok meme that in turn was based on the hit Pixar animated movie.\n\nThe 20-year-old Feldman has been a fan of murder mysteries since he was a child growing up in suburban Manhasset, New York. He\'s hosted gatherings for a decade built around mail-order murder mystery parties, including some with fellow Evan Hansen cast members before and just after the pandemic hit.\n\nFeldman and Evan Hansen co-star Alex Boniello also collaborated on a string of fundraisers for actor charities that streamed on Twitch featuring stars playing the online party-game package Jackbox.\n\nBoniello was also part of Broadway Whodunit, an initial effort by Feldman to use Zoom, Vimeo, and other online tools early in the pandemic to tell several mystery tales. Ultimately, the pair decided to adapt those stories to a somewhat different approach that wasn\'t hamstrung by the limits of the conferencing software.\n\nThe result was the five episodes of Foul Play, which were shot over a couple of weeks on highly stylized interconnected sets built for different setups such as a mansion party, a 1940s film noir, a Dungeons & Dragons gathering, a reality TV show, and a boy band.\n\nFeldman and Boniello worked with a Ukrainian technology company, Sigma Software, to create the software needed for the experience to run online with all the evidence, cameras and conversations simultaneously available. Their project was backed by $1 million in funding from TBD Theatricals, a prominent Broadway producer.\n\n""It\'s a strange sort of movie/(full-motion-video) video game/kind of board game thing,"" Boniello said. ""This platform just didn\'t straight up exist.""\n\nPerformers, many of them Broadway, film and TV veterans, were given wide latitude to improvise their parts during the filming, as long as they mentioned specific story ""beats"" along the way that would be crucial clues.\n\nBut not even the actor playing the murderer was told of their ""guilt"" until partway through the shooting, after the murder itself happens, so they wouldn\'t inadvertently give away anything in the shows\' early acts, Feldman said.\n\nCast members include some notables: Stranger Things\' Gaten Matarazzo, Michael Urie (Shrinking), Ryan Haddad (The Politician), Rob McClure (Mrs. Doubtfire), Erica Hernandez (Bridge and Tunnel), Will Roland (Billions), Celia Rose Gooding (Star Trek: Strange New Worlds), and Alex Brightman (School of Rock).\n\nAs the episodes unspool over the next few weeks, each debut will be accompanied by a live Discord server conversation with Feldman, Boniello and others. The first 20 audience members who solve each mystery on the Discord conversation will be rewarded with additional behind-the-scenes and other content related to the project.\n\n""I referred to myself as a gardener, planting so many seeds, because we didn\'t have any other kind of outlet,"" said Boniello. ""The primary way we understood to tell stories and make money was taken from us (by the pandemic). It\'s so wild that three years on, we\'re starting to see every seed start to take off. That\'s a very flowery way to put it.""\n\nFoul Play indeed is a very different approach to telling a tale. Audiences can click between rooms and cameras to overhear conversations as performers move in and out of them. Audiences will also have access to bits of ""evidence"" to help them solve the crime. But by definition, they\'ll do so with\n\nFoul Play arrives in an era of revived audience love for the classic ""everybody in the room"" style of murder mysteries first made popular by Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie\'s Murder on the Orient Express, and similar works.\n\nHulu has a critical and fan favorite with the Emmy-nominated Only Murders in the Building. Writer/director Rian Johnson and star Daniel Craig had a massive theatrical hit with 2019\'s feature Knives Out, featuring Craig\'s drawling detective Benoit Blanc. It grossed nearly $319 million worldwide.\n\nNetflix NFLX then paid Johnson and Craig $500 million for the rights to two sequels, the first of which, Glass Onion, was one of the streaming service\'s most-watched hits when it debuted around Christmas.\n\nFeldman\'s next project is a notable one, starring opposite Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence in the indie comedy No Hard Feelings, debuting in June.\n\nAccess to Foul Play is $9.99 per episode, or $39.99 for the five.

"Fed Expects 'Mild Recession' This Year After Banking Crisis Rattles Markets The Federal Reserve now projects the nation\'s economy to fall into a ""mild recession"" by year\'s end, according to minutes from the Fed\'s Open Markets Committee meeting March 21-22 as the central bank navigated through an unexpected crisis in the country\'s banking sector.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks following the Fed\'s March 22 meeting.\n\nBanking turmoil led central bank officials to downgrade their economic forecasts, according to the notes released Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThough all FOMC members ultimately voted in favor of a 25 basis-point increase to the federal funds rate, several officials considered backing a pause to the hikes in the wake of the string of bank failures.\n\nThe Fed continues to see ""slower-than-expected progress on disinflation,"" according to the minutes.\n\nStocks were largely flat, maintaining modest gains from earlier trading following the release of the latest inflation report.\n\nThe latest Fed meeting came less than two weeks after the second and third-largest bank failures in American history as venture capital darling Silicon Valley Bank and crypto stalwart Signature Bank collapsed. The failures, caused largely by the banks\' ineffectiveness at navigating rapid interest rate hikes, led to calls for the Fed to quit its rate hike campaign to focus its efforts on stabilizing the banking sector. The Fed upped rates at its last nine meetings, sending the federal funds rate from near zero to 4.75% to 5%, a 16-year high, as it used its primary tool to cool inflation. The Fed\'s war on inflation has started to bear fruits, with inflation cooling to its lowest annualized level since May 2021 last month, though the 5% inflation rate remains far above the bank\'s 2% target. Higher interest rates have dragged down stocks as elevated borrowing costs cut into corporate profit; the S&P 500 is down 14% from its December 2021 peak.\n\nThe next meeting of the Fed\'s policy panel will be May 2-3. The futures market implies a 28% chance the central bank will keep rates the same and a 72% chance it will again raise rates by 25 basis points, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\n""Central banks recognize…the trade-off between inflation coming down over a longer period of time and the potential to severely damage economic and financial conditions,"" Rick Rieder, head of BlackRock\'s global allocation investment unit, wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. ""Despite rightly \'talking tough\' on inflation, [central banks are] modifying their expectations for the degree of tightening required this cycle.""\n\nThe S&P didn\'t hit a low until an average of six months following the Fed\'s first cut to interest rates during the central bank\'s last 10 hiking cycles, Darrell L. Cronk, the chief investment officer of Wells Fargo\'s wealth management division, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said he doesn\'t anticipate any rate cuts in 2023.\n\nFed Hikes Interest Rates Another 25 Basis Points--But Suggests The End Is Near (Forbes)\n\nPrices Rose Another 5% In March--Lowest Inflation Reading In Nearly Two Years (Forbes)\n\nHere\'s What\'s Dropping In Price The Most As Inflation Cools To 22-Month Low (Forbes) https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/04/12/fed-officials-now-expect-us-will-enter-mild-recession-this-year-after-banking-crisis-rattles-markets/"

"Want Good IT Projects? Tackle That Elephant In The Room Learn to recognize the elephant, find the courage to confront the elephant, and eventually you will win.\n\nShow me a corporate IT project that\'s having difficulties and I will bet I can show you that the problem isn\'t the technology. Usually, a basic human issue has not been addressed. The very need to address it has been overlooked, to the point where it becomes the elephant in the room -- squashing the chances to do top-notch IT implementation from day one.\n\nThe problem lies with the company\'s executive team. The C-level officers and key department heads may think of themselves as ""team players."" But in most midsized companies, and even a lot of large ones, they haven\'t built the relationships needed to work together on a high level in high-stakes situations.\n\nWatch how the top pro sports teams perform. In the Chiefs\' latest Super Bowl run, there were times when Patrick Mahomes and his receivers seemed to have a magical connection, with the ball getting to the right guy at just the right moment. They didn\'t achieve that magic simply by running plays in formal practice sessions. This QB and his receivers are known for bonding on a personal level. They go for meals together, play video games and work out together; they\'re constantly both talking and practicing their mutual craft. Likewise on good baseball teams: the catchers and pitchers try to get on an intimate wavelength so they can make joint decisions, quickly and effectively, about how to deal with opposing batters.\n\nVery few executive teams have this degree of synergy. The CMO, CFO, head of sales and other top leaders all try to be nice to each other. They have their own domains and budgets, so they stay in their lanes and avoid interfering with their neighbors. They can run the company day-to-day pretty smoothly this way. But when it comes to doing something new that affects many of them -- like a significant IT project -- they\'re not grounded in sufficient relationships.\n\nSuppose the CMO wants to invest in renovating the campaign management systems, which aren\'t generating enough leads. If this is done in a vacuum it won\'t go well. The new system must work with sales to convert the leads efficiently. Our firm has been the IT solutions provider on many such projects. I\'d estimate that of every million dollars spent with us, half of it goes to getting the client\'s team members properly aligned. Sometimes this is very difficult, but it\'s necessary. If the personal and emotional relations between team members are weak -- or worse, adversarial -- they won\'t be on the same page at the start, nor will they pull together through the tough parts.\n\nThere may come a point in any project when you face the equivalent of needing to rally from a touchdown behind. That is when a poorly aligned team breaks down. Instead of collaborating under pressure, instead of the players knowing how they must interact to get it done, they throw rocks at each other over what\'s gone wrong. You\'ve seen it happen in sports on TV, with a receiver and quarterback screaming at one another on the sidelines while scuffles break out around them. That\'s what executive team breakdown looks like. Everybody is getting trampled by the elephant that everybody ignored. The company has essentially drafted a bunch of players and expected them to blend in, without the relational foundations they need.\n\nThe solution? In our experience, structured team-building exercises don\'t help much. Someone needs to take the initiative informally. Just say, for instance: ""Hey, let\'s do lunch or go out together sometimes."" Get closer, have some fun, and in the process, talk some business: ""You know, here\'s what comes up for me. What about you? How do you think we should handle it?"" Build on these beginnings and eventually you\'ll have a team of champions: a team that can work together to conceive a good game plan, then move it down the field to the goal.\n\nAlways remember that the intangibles matter \'way more than the tangibles. Just because you can\'t control them in a formal setting doesn\'t mean that the biggest risk on a project disappears. Learn to recognize the elephant, find the courage to confront the elephant, and eventually you will win Super Bowls. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2023/04/12/want-good-it-projects-tackle-that-elephant-in-the-room/"
"New 'Max' Streaming Service Combines HBO And Discovery  Shows--Here's What You Need To Know HBO Max and Discovery  unveiled a merged mega-streaming service called Max on Wednesday, marking a crucial move for Warner Bros. Discovery as the conglomerate vies for more subscribers following a major merger and a rocky year for streaming services.\n\nDiscovery  and HBO Max will merge into a streaming service called Max.\n\nWith the slogan \'The One to Watch,"" Max intends to combine HBO Max\'s scripted shows and movies, Discovery \'s unscripted reality TV and Warner Brothers\' collection of children\'s content to cater to ""every member of the household,"" Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said during a press event Wednesday.\n\nThe new service is scheduled to launch May 23.\n\nThe subscription price will be tiered at $10 for a monthly subscription with ads, and $16 per month for an ad-free version, the same as HBO Max\'s current options.\n\nWhile HBO Max will become a super-service combining both providers\' offerings, Discovery --currently priced at $4.99 a month with ads--will remain a separate, lower-tiered entity that users can subscribe to if they\'re uninterested in HBO\'s scripted content, a change from the company\'s original plan to scrap Discovery  altogether.\n\nOn May 23, HBO Max will automatically update to Max for most users, maintaining subscribers\' passwords, billing and watch history, while Discovery  users will have to up their subscriptions if they want to watch HBO\'s scripted series like Succession and The Last of Us.\n\nThe new service was created in a ""time of transition for the streaming industry,"" Warner Bros. Discovery Global CEO Jean-Briac Perrette said, and is designed to simplify user experience by consolidating content for all demographics in one place.\n\nOne major area of change will be adding more kids-oriented content, including Warner Bros.\' Looney Tunes and Sesame Street, and product features to cater toward children.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery hopes to reach 130 million subscribers across HBO Max and Discovery  by 2025--it\'s currently at about 96.1 million globally.\n\nThere\'s a lot riding on the mega-streaming service, which was a major selling point in a $43 billion merger of Discovery and HBO Max\'s parent company WarnerMedia (previously owned by AT&T), which formed conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022. Many of the company\'s top competitors like Disney, NBCUniversal and Paramount Global have invested heavily in streaming services in recent years as viewers migrate away from traditional TV. The year since the Discovery-Warner merger has been a rocky one for television streaming, with Netflix reporting last summer it had lost almost a million subscribers, though it reversed those declines in the second half of 2022. Warner Bros. Discovery also executed some major layoffs in 2022, including cutting 14% of HBO Max staff and 26% of Warner Bros. Television Group workers, and its share price has fallen 42% in the last year despite recovering from a low point in December. A focus on the bottom line over bells and whistles will reportedly be reflected in Max\'s unveiling, which will include marketing plans, technological upgrades and some series and movie announcements, a far cry from the star-studded launch of other streaming services like Apple TV  in 2019.\n\n\'Succession\' and \'Dr. Pimple Popper\' Together in New Warner Streaming App (New York Times)\n\nWarner Bros.

"Apple iPhone 15 Pro Will Have Dazzling New Look, Leak Claims Will the bezel on the iPhone 15 Pro be even thinner than here on the iPhone 14 Pro Max?\n\nThis fall\'s iPhone 15 series, or at least the Pro models in the range, seem likely to upgrade the all-screen effect of the phones by slimming the already-narrow bezels to a record-breaking thinness.\n\nApril 12 update below. This post was first published on April 9, 2023.\n\nApril 12 update. Talking of dazzling new design, there\'s been one persistent rumor for how the next iPhone will look different: the power and volume buttons, plus the mute switch. On the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, all were to be replaced with solid-state buttons, it was believed.\n\nThis intriguing prospect has now receded, it seems. That\'s a shame, as these updated buttons sounded remarkable: no more springy buttons and a physical switch. Instead, extra haptic response in the form of not one but two extra Taptic Engines on board would let the user know that their button presses had been recognized, without the buttons actually moving at all. Apple would doubtless have pulled off this trick brilliantly. After all, the Home button on later iPhones were persuasive in giving the impression of movement, and the Force Touch on Mac trackpads is completely convincing.\n\nAlas, this witchcraft will not be delighting us just yet. According to the reliable Ming-Chi Kuo from TF International Securities, in a new Medium post today, ""due to unresolved technical issues before mass production, both high-end iPhone 15 Pro models (Pro & Pro Max) will abandon the closely-watched solid-state button design and revert to the traditional physical button design.""\n\nThe analyst indicates that the decision has been made now because of where the development of the phone is up to. And making the decision now should not delay this fall\'s iPhones. Kuo says, ""The iPhone 15 Pro is currently in the EVT development stage, so there is still time to modify the design. In addition, removing the solid-state buttons and restoring physical buttons will simplify the development and testing process. Based on these factors, removing solid-state buttons should have a limited impact on the mass production schedule and shipments for Pro models.""\n\nIt looks like we might have to wait a whole extra year for these futuristic buttons. Now, back to the way the iPhone 15 Pro display may look.\n\nThat\'s according to a new report from reliable leaker Ice Universe, who last month said the iPhone 15 Pro would have the thinnest bezel of any smartphone. And now, the same leaker has a set of photos which are now to be seen on Twitter.\n\nThese show the relative sizes of the bezels on the iPhone 14 Pro and two glass covers which are claimed to the be the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The black edging which is the bezel, that is the only bits that are not the touchscreen, is very slim indeed. Ice Universe says the new bezels will be just 1.55mm wide, compared to the 2.1mm thickness of the iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nSo what, you might say. Apple\'s full-screen phones, ever since the launch of the iPhone X in 2017, have always had narrow bezels, even the ones with LCD displays like the iPhone XR and iPhone 11.\n\nBut the thinner the bezel, the more compelling the image. And not just because of that 1.55mm measurement. One of the reasons that Apple\'s Face ID iPhones have looked great since 2017 is that the bezel is uniform all the way round. Other smartphones to this day often have a bigger bezel on the bottom edge, because that\'s where the display drivers sit. Apple\'s technique is to take a flexible OLED screen and bend it round behind itself so the drivers are out of view.\n\nBut with such a move to an even thinner bezel, a question arises: the Cornish pasty effect. When Cornish tin miners in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries needed a food they could eat without washing their hands, they turned to the pasty. The shortcrust pastry is formed with meat and vegetables inside and a crimped edge around it, creating a complete meal which could be easily carried and eaten without cutlery. Miners, whose working fingers might have had traces of arsenic on them, could discard the crimped edge which they used to hold it while eating, it was thought.\n\nSo, with the iPhone 15 Pro and its devilishly thin bezels, will there be anywhere to hold the phone without brushing against the touchscreen? Apple will have thought of this, but it\'s an interesting conundrum.\n\nBeyond that, the predicted screen looks very striking, and it\'s noticeable that the Dynamic Island remains in place, and the same size as before, it seems. While the additional pixels provided by a thinner bezel may not be that many, the difference in the look, especially compared to non-Apple phones, could be transformational. https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2023/04/12/apple-iphone-15-pro-will-have-dazzling-new-look-leak-claims/"
"Elon Musk Says Twitter Got Rid Of Scammers But The Ads Prove Otherwise One of the scam crypto ads purchased with a verified account seen on Twitter on Wednesday morning.\n\nMost of the scammers have abandoned Twitter, according to CEO Elon Musk, who sat down for an interview with the BBC on Tuesday night. But if you\'re a Twitter user with an interest in tech, you might be seeing some incredibly scammy ads right now. Some of the ads even use Musk\'s face to sell SpaceX-themed crypto, falsely claiming the billionaire has endorsed the digital product.\n\nWhen the BBC asked Musk if he was concerned about the spread of misinformation on the platform--an interview that was livestreamed on Twitter\'s Spaces audio feature late Tuesday--the CEO insisted it wasn\'t a problem.\n\n""I actually think there\'s less [misinformation] these days because we\'ve eliminated so many of the bots which were pushing scams and spam,"" Musk said.\n\nThe BBC also asked Musk if big advertisers had returned to the platform after their much publicized departure when he bought the company in October 2022, and the CEO said, ""not all, but most.""\n\n""You can see it for yourself on Twitter,"" Musk told the BBC.\n\nBut that certainly hasn\'t been my experience over the past few months. As a regular Twitter user, I\'ve been seeing lots of crypto scams that use Musk\'s image--a problem that\'s persisted.\n\n""Breaking news for all crypto investors around the world! The visionary CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk, has just announced the launch of the official SpaceX Token, and the Pre-Sale is now open for a limited time only,"" one of the scam websites that\'s advertising on Twitter claims.\n\nMusk has publicly touted his investments in crypto like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, but the billionaire Twitter CEO has never started his own cryptocurrency. And the ad above, which is currently making money for Twitter, is transparently a scam.\n\nThe landing page for the Twitter ad directs users to a much more polished website with SpaceX branding where they can purchase the scam coins. And it even promises prizes for people who purchase the crypto.\n\n""Investors who acquire 3,000 SpaceX Tokens will be eligible to spin a Lucky Wheel that could result in winning a variety of prizes, including a trip to Mars in 2025, a flame thrower from The Boring Company, a Neuralink brain chip that interfaces with OpenAI, or token bonuses,"" the scam website claims.\n\nScreenshot showing one of the crypto scam websites currently being promoted on Twitter.\n\nAgain, Musk has never launched his own token and whoever\'s really behind this ad doesn\'t have the ability to give people things like a Neuralink brain chip or a trip to Mars. Even Musk isn\'t promising anyone a trip to Mars yet, despite tremendous accomplishments being made with SpaceX rockets.\n\nBut that doesn\'t stop the scam ads from insisting SpaceX is really behind this new crypto.\n\n""SpaceX Token is a groundbreaking cryptocurrency project built by Elon Musk\'s space exploration company, SpaceX,"" the scam website reads.\n\n""Featuring its own blockchain, SpaceX Chain offers a range of cutting-edge features that surpass other blockchains. This community-based project offers the opportunity for investors to participate in the funding of space exploration and to have a say in decision-making processes,"" the website continues.\n\nAside from photos of Musk, the ads also frequently use the logos of reputable crypto news outlets, as you can see in the screenshot I\'ve highlighted below. That logo is for Coin Telegraph, a real crypto news site, though these scammers have no known association with the outlet.\n\nScam crypto ad that\'s currently being shown on Twitter, which uses a Coin Telegraph logo.\n\nThe ads are also sometimes run on accounts that have purchased Twitter Blue, the subscription service that costs $8 per month for individuals. Twitter doesn\'t actually verify anyone\'s identity when they pay for Twitter Blue, a decision that has caused institutional accounts to wonder why they\'d pay for a checkmark without any real functionality.\n\nMusk tweeted last night that ""legacy"" blue checkmarks would vanish by April 20, though it\'s not clear whether that will actually happen. The number 4/20 is a reference to marijuana and Musk frequently makes jokes about it.\n\nAnd I\'m not the only one seeing these scam ads. People often tweet at Musk asking if the SpaceX coin ads they\'re seeing are real. But Musk hasn\'t responded to any of the questions, as far as I can tell.\n\nA Twitter user asks Elon Musk if the SpaceX token is real.\n\nBelieve it or not, people actually fall for these crypto scams. I even obtained the documents from the FTC to prove it back in January.\n\nHow much of Twitter\'s ads are currently scams? That\'s difficult to estimate at this point, but I\'ve been seeing the ads regularly since I first wrote about the problem back in February and March. Each time, I reached out to Twitter to ask about what the social media platform might be doing to combat these scammers, but have not gotten a real response.\n\nTwitter responded to emailed questions on Wednesday with a poop emoji, an automated response set up by Musk that goes out to all reporters. I\'ll update this article on the off chance Musk addresses this issue in any way.\n\nMusk is scheduled to be interviewed at the Possible Conference in Miami, Florida on April 18. But numerous major advertisers have expressed a concern about even appearing at the conference with Musk, according to leaked emails obtained by Semafor. And it\'s really no mystery why big brands might be concerned.\n\nLately, Musk has been making juvenile jokes at Twitter, even painting over the ""W"" on the sign at the company\'s San Francisco headquarters, apparently a joke about breasts. And overnight, Musk made several jokes about the BBC being a reference to pornography--a joke I\'ll let you look up on Urban Dictionary if you don\'t know what it means.\n\n""I said BBC could come Twitter, then, to my surprise, a reporter shows up,"" Musk tweeted.\n\n""Penetrating deep & hard with @BBC,"" Musk said in another porn joke.\n\nMusk, who\'s 51 years old, is free to make all the jokes he wants on a platform he owns. But if the billionaire was seriously concerned about attracting advertisers to the social media site, you\'d think he\'d want to make it an inviting place for all kinds of people. Under Twitter\'s current management, Twitter has given blue checkmarks to at least two open neo-Nazis with huge followings, including one account with a racial slur.\n\nThe current era of Twitter is one that seems to be driven by Musk making jokes. And he\'s free to do that all he wants. But big brands are also free to say they don\'t want to be associated with Twitter if it\'s just going to be an adult man\'s playhouse filled with crypto scams. https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/04/12/elon-musk-says-twitter-got-rid-of-scammers-but-the-ads-prove-otherwise/"
"The Best Diaper Rash Creams To Keep Baby Bums Happy And Clear If you\'ve ever dealt with a child\'s bad diaper rash, you know just how disruptive it can be for your little one (and you). Almost all babies experience diaper rash at some point, although some have more sensitive skin than others and are more prone to breakouts. Either way, you\'ll want to stock up on the best diaper rash creams to quickly soothe their little bottoms.\n\nSlather one of these best diaper rash creams onto your little one during diapering to both prevent ... [ ] and stop troublesome rashes.\n\nTypical diaper rashes are caused by moisture and bacteria being held against the skin in a warm environment. The skin appears red, bumpy and sore. Rashes may be mild or can be quite painful. These more typical rashes can be treated or prevented with an over-the-counter diaper cream, such as you\'ll find in this story. Other types of severe diaper rashes, such as those caused by bacteria or a fungus, might require a medicated ointment from your pediatrician.\n\n""There are different kinds of diaper creams depending on the type of rash: contact, fungal or bacterial,"" says Dr. Jen Trachtenberg, board-certified pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""In general, for a red contact diaper rash due to wetness, moisture or stool, look for a diaper cream with zinc oxide, which protects and allows the diaper area to heal by forming a protective barrier on top of the skin. The key is to slather it on like you would be frosting a cake.""\n\nYou may want to consider costs (as you\'ll go through quite a bit of this stuff), texture (is the cream runny or nice and thick?), smell and type of dispenser (squeezable tube or a tub that\'s scoopable) while selecting the best diaper rash cream for your baby or toddler. As a registered nurse and mother, I\'m no stranger to high-stress diaper changes full of squirming and wailing. I hope this list of the best diaper rash creams helps you, too. After reading it, you may want to take a peek at our favorite changing tables, best tested diaper pails, changing pads and tested diaper bags to complete your diapering setup.\n\nThis sweet smelling diaper cream from Weleda Baby won the top spot overall due to its ingredient profile and rave reviews from parents. This cream features 12% zinc oxide, which is the top pediatrician-recommended ingredient for treating diaper rash due to its effectiveness at blocking moisture. Plant-based ingredients such as calendula, chamomile, sesame and sweet almond oil help soothe skin irritation (although be sure to avoid this one if your little one has a nut or sesame allergy!). I\'ve found that this diaper cream works well both in terms of preventing and treating diaper rash. Keep in mind that given its natural ingredients, this cream can separate over time. It also has a lower zinc oxide content than some of our other picks, so if you\'re dealing with a stubborn or severe rash, you may want to try a cream with a higher percentage of zinc oxide.\n\nDesitin\'s Maximum Strength Baby Diaper Rash Cream boasts a whopping 40% zinc oxide content. It can\'t be beat for value, ease of application and effectiveness at treating even tough diaper rashes. Some zinc oxide creams are goopy or drippy, but Desitin\'s creamy formula goes on smoothly and stays in place. The ingredients are hypoallergenic, phthalate- and paraben-free. While zinc oxide is well tolerated by most babies, as it is a mineral that sits on top of the skin (rather than being absorbed), there may be some babies who have a sensitivity to zinc oxide. It can also leave residue on clothing and changing pads. For cost-effective daily rash prevention, Desitin also offers a 13% zinc oxide cream that is simple and effective.\n\nIf your baby has sensitive skin, diaper rashes can be extra troublesome. Typical diaper rash creams may not be well tolerated. This fragrance-free diaper cream from Babo Botanicals is a great choice for babies with especially sensitive skin. It contains an effective 25% non-nano zinc oxide as a moisture barrier and colloidal oatmeal, shea butter and cocoa butter to soothe your baby\'s skin. This cream is vegan-friendly, made in the USA and its ingredients are highly rated for safety by the Environmental Working Group. (Non-nano refers to the size of the zinc oxide particles. Non-nano means larger particles, not smaller, particles were used, thus making the material less likely to be absorbed into your skin and bloodstream.) It\'s worth noting that while oatmeal, cocoa and shea butter are often ideal for babies with sensitive skin, some children might react to these ingredients.\n\nIf your baby\'s bum rash is significant or other products haven\'t worked, this may be the cream for you. Triple Paste\'s main ingredients are non-nano 12.8% zinc oxide to provide a moisture barrier and oat extract and beeswax to soothe irritated skin. This cream also includes lanolin, petrolatum and corn starch, which are very effective at protecting skin and preventing irritating moisture from getting to the sore areas while they heal. It\'s free of dyes, parabens, phthalates and preservatives as well as fragrance free, making it ideal for sensitive skin. ""My pediatrician recommended this cream when one of my kids couldn\'t kick a repeat rash; it worked immediately, and we stuck with it as a preventative cream and it truly kept the worst at bay,"" says Rose Gordon Sala, the baby and kids gear editor at Forbes Vetted. ""This was for my kid who has eczema, sensitive skin and food allergies, so we also needed something with minimal ingredients and that would be gentle on her.""\n\nA household name in the world of gentle skincare, Aquaphor makes an effective and affordable diaper rash paste that gets great reviews from parents and pediatricians alike. This paste contains 40% zinc oxide to treat bad diaper rashes and provide the maximum protection from moisture. Shea butter claims to help soothe painful, irritated skin starting with the first application. The product is also fragrance-, talc-, and paraben-free, making it suitable for sensitive skin. The brand also offers another diaper rash cream with a lower zinc oxide percentage of 15%.\n\nWe love this Tubby Todd Bath Co. diaper cream for a daily diapering cream because it is gentle, fragrance-free includes skin-nourishing ingredients like beeswax, shea butter, vitamin E and sunflower seed oil. Still it doesn\'t neglect the basics: It contains 14% zinc oxide to provide a barrier against urine and stools to prevent rashes from forming. Cruelty-free, made in the USA and with a ""worry-free guarantee"" that means you love it or get your money back, this is a diaper cream that\'s easy to feel good about. It\'s worth noting that this is one of the more expensive options on the list, especially given the size of the tube and if you use it every day.\n\nCertified organic soothing ingredients such as aloe vera, shea butter, and vitamins A, D and E combined with 15% zinc oxide make this a great choice for treating diaper rash. While some parents reported the solution to be a little runny, most found that this organic cream works well against typical diaper rashes. It\'s also free from parabens, phthalates and synthetic dyes and fragrances. Note for parents avoiding nut oils that it does contain almond oil. While it\'s a bit more expensive than traditional creams, this is a great price for a more natural-minded product.\n\nFounded by a nurse and mother trying to treat her baby\'s eczema without chemicals, Henry\'s Homestead is a small business that is committed to natural skincare products. Its Healing Salve is a multipurpose solution that can be used on diaper rashes and a variety of other skin complaints. This ointment is cruelty free, sulfate free, pesticide free, glyphosate free and paraben free. The main ingredients include sweet almond oil, coconut oil, beeswax, shea butter, lavender, tea tree oil, lemon, olive oil, jojoba oil and vitamin E (yes, it reads like something you could eat!). ""This is one of those cult-following products that not many people know about, but everyone who uses it loves it and swears by it and uses it for everything,"" says Ashley Kohl, a mom of two under 2. ""It\'s not a moisture barrier, it\'s more of a healing cream. You can put it on cuts, burns, diaper rash, eczema. I\'ve never used traditional diaper cream on either of my kids; I\'ve just used this stuff."" It would be worth doing a patch test before applying this product all over your child given that some skin types may react to nut oils or essential oils, and it\'s worth noting that this does not contain zinc oxide.\n\nI rounded up these top diaper rash creams by interviewing a number of physicians who are experts in the fields of pediatrics and dermatology to ask for their recommendations on ingredients and more. I also solicited additional feedback from parents. As a registered nurse with a background in clinical research and pediatric oncology, I also take my research into any pediatric product, especially a health item, seriously. I\'m a mother to three young children and have tried a number of these diaper creams firsthand over the years. As a writer, covering baby and kid items, I\'m accustomed to analyzing ingredients and features, too. I scoured online reviews to consider how other parents felt about these creams and considered each item\'s cost, ingredients, texture, accessibility and effectiveness. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-diaper-rash-creams/"
"Watch Champions League Soccer: Livestream Real Madrid vs. Chelsea From Anywhere     - CNET Real Madrid's pursuit of a sixth UEFA Champions League title in 10 years continues this evening as they take on Chelsea in this quarterfinal first leg clash.\n\nThey may be European royalty, but Real Madrid have fallen off the pace domestically in recent weeks. Carlo Ancelotti's side are currently 13 points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona, which means added focus on their quest for yet more continental glory.\n\nThat makes for a worrying prospect for a vulnerable-looking Chelsea side that is once again in transition following the re-appointment of Frank Lampard as caretaker manager.\n\nLampard hasn't had the best of starts since returning to take the helm at Stamford Bridge as Graham Potter's replacement, and his goal-shy team look likely to struggle against a Real Madrid side with nothing else on their minds.\n\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live wherever you are in the world.\n\nReal Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been in superb form this season, notching up 25 goals in 32 competitive appearances.\n\nReal Madrid host Chelsea at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Wednesday, April 12. Kickoff is set for 9 p.m. CET local time in Spain (8 p.m. BST in the UK, 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT in the US, and at 5 a.m. AEST on Thursday, April 13 in Australia).\n\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\n\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, nonblackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\n\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\n\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\n\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 per month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 49% plus get three months of access for free -- the equivalent of $6.67 per month -- if you get an annual subscription.\n\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nWednesday's big match at the Bernabéu will be available to stream on Paramount Plus, which has live broadcast rights in the US for every UEFA Champions League and Europa League fixture for the 2022/23 season.\n\nParamount Plus has two main subscription plans in the US: Essential for $5 per month ($50 per year if paid annually) and Premium for $10 per month ($100 per year). Both offer coverage of all Champions League fixtures this season.\n\nThe cheaper Essential option has ads for on-demand streaming and lacks live CBS feeds as well as the ability to download shows to watch offline later. Newcomers to the service can take advantage of a 30-day free trial, while students may qualify for a 25% discount.\n\nRead our Paramount Plus review.\n\nChampions League rights in the UK are with BT Sport, with this game set to be broadcast on the BT Sport 1 and BT Sport Ultimate 4K channels. If you already have BT Sport as part of your TV package, you can stream the game via the BT Sport app, but cord-cutters will want to get set up with a BT Sport Monthly Pass account to stream the game.\n\nIf you're already a BT TV customer you can currently access BT Sport channels for £10 per month. BT Broadband customers can watch the channels via the BT Sport app for £16.\n\nIf you don't want to be locked down to a lengthy contract, there's also the option of BT Sport Monthly Pass, which costs £30 per month and lets you stream all four BT Sport channels across iOS and Android devices, plus a wide range of set-top boxes and smart TVs. It's a rolling one-month contract that you can cancel anytime.\n\nIf you want to stream this game live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to DAZN Canada. The service has exclusive broadcast rights to every Champions League match this season.\n\nA DAZN subscription currently costs CA$25 a month or CA$200 a year and will also give you access to Europa League and EFL Championship soccer, Six Nations rugby and WTA tennis.\n\nAs well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, there's a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.\n\nFootball fans Down Under can watch this UEFA Champions League fixture on streaming service Stan Sport, which is showing every single Champions League game live in Australia this season.\n\nStan Sport will set you back AU$10 per month (on top of a AU$10 Stan subscription), but the streaming service is currently offering a seven-day free trial.\n\nA subscription will also give you access to Europa League and Europa Conference League action, as well as international rugby and Formula E. https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/watch-champions-league-soccer-livestream-real-madrid-vs-chelsea-from-anywhere/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"Retail Cannabis Often Less Potent Than Advertised, Study Suggests The potency of some cannabis products sold by legal retailers may be lower than what is reported on the label, according to a study released Wednesday, as researchers say a discrepancy in labeling could negatively affect the multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\nA study suggests retail cannabis may be less potent than advertised.\n\nResearchers from the University of Northern Colorado analyzed 23 samples of cannabis flower from 10 dispensaries in Colorado and found that 16 (70%) samples had at least 15% lower concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)--the molecule that causes cannabis' psychoactive effects--than advertised.\n\nThe reported potency varied between products, researchers said, as THC content differed from advertised levels by as much as nearly 55% in one sample and as little as 13% in another.\n\nThe study suggests a discrepancy in THC values could be caused by a lack of standardized testing for potency, limited government oversight and possible financial incentives to advertise higher-potency products.\n\nResearchers called on dispensaries to sell products with more accurate labeling, as inaccurate labels could impact sales and possibly harm consumers.\n\n$33 billion. That's the projected total sales of recreational and medical cannabis in the U.S. in 2022. Of this, $1.7 billion came from sales in Colorado, which became the first state to offer legal recreational marijuana sales almost a decade ago, according to state records.\n\nMore than 20 states have legalized recreational marijuana, a number that continues to grow. A bill expanding Iowa's medical marijuana program while also legalizing recreational use for adults was introduced in February, as similar bills have been introduced in Minnesota and Ohio. If those three states legalize marijuana, 24 states in the U.S. will allow recreational marijuana use, while dozens of others have decriminalized low-level possession offenses.\n\nMore young adults are consuming cannabis in recent years, as a study published by the National Institutes of Health indicates 43% of people aged 19 to 30 used marijuana in 2021, an increase of 34% over the previous five years. An August 2022 Gallup poll also found that marijuana use reached an all-time high, exceeding tobacco's popularity. Despite this, the health effects of using cannabis products have not been as closely monitored as smoking tobacco. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say smoking marijuana could lead to an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, other vascular diseases and could also harm lung tissues and cause scarring and damage to blood vessels. A small study also suggested emphysema and airway inflammation were more common among marijuana smokers than cigarette smokers. Another study, which analyzed health data from 175,000 people, found that daily cannabis use could result in an increased risk of heart disease.\n\nMarijuana Use Could Increase Chances For Heart Disease, Study Suggests (Forbes)\n\nSmoking Marijuana Is More Likely To Cause Emphysema Than Cigarettes, Study Suggests (Forbes) https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2023/04/12/retail-cannabis-often-less-potent-than-advertised-study-suggests/"
"Psychologists Define What The Term 'Frenemy' Really Means Do you feel like someone close to you might not have your best interests at heart?\n\nA new study published in the Southern Communication Journal offers a succinct definition of a term that has become commonplace in pop culture over the past decade: what it means to be a \'frenemy.\'\n\n""Despite the prevalence of frenemies in popular culture and the significant effect these relationships can have on our lives, frenemy scholarship is limited and contradictory,"" says Dr. Jenna Abetz, the lead author of the study. ""Developing an in-vivo definition of the frenemy relationship portrays the realities of these relationships as they are lived.""\n\nTo land on such a definition, Dr. Abetz and her team interviewed 29 adults between the ages of 19 and 62 to get a better sense of how individuals who have had a frenemy define and understand the term.\n\nThey found that many of the interviewees shared similar feelings about frenemy relationships, leading the researchers to land on the following definition: ""Relationships, often negative, steeped in situational ties and shared social connections that outwardly appear friendly but are fraught with underlying competition, jealousy, or distrust.""\n\nUnlike genuine friendships, the researchers found that frenemy relationships displayed three prominent characteristics:\n\nThe dynamic was described by some interviewees as \'hot and cold,\' with the frenemy repeatedly giving mixed signals as they shifted between friend-like and foe-like mentalities.\n\nWhile many of these relationships were found embedded in unavoidable social circles and networks like family, school, and work, some participants stated that frenemy relationships evolved from seemingly true friendships that became pressured due to external circumstances.\n\nInterestingly, having a frenemy was more of a \'felt\' experience than a verbally-defined label. In other words, frenemy relationships have an element of \'unspokenness\' in them.\n\nThis is not to say that frenemy relationships don\'t come with their own silver linings. Some interviewees shared positive outcomes amidst the dark cloud of a frenemy relationship.\n\n""For some, the outcome of having a frenemy was better awareness of what they wanted and deserved in a true friendship,"" explains Abetz. ""Others reflected on those teachable life lessons -- and that having a frenemy highlighted future relational red flags for them.""\n\nHere are two thoughts shared by interviewees that highlight the positive side of their experience with frenemies:\n\nExperience with frenemies or frenemy-like relationships underscores the importance of learning what a good friendship looks and feels like by having experience with a wide range of social relationships. This is especially important for children and adolescents to understand as they learn how to navigate the social world. They need to know that while no friendship is perfect, frenemy dynamics are not genuine friendships and they should not feel compelled to maintain them if there is a clear undercurrent of distrust.\n\n""It is important for parents and educators to be able to assist adolescents in identifying unhealthy relational patterns and how they manifest in friendships,"" says Abetz. ""While learning how to make and be a friend is one of the central developmental tasks of elementary school, as children age they still need guidance and support navigating challenging friendship dynamics.""\n\nAbetz hopes that her research not only helps people define an somewhat indescribable relationship feeling, but that it can be used to teach young adults how to seek out more positive relationships in their own lives.\n\nA full interview with Professor Jenna Abetz discussing her new research on frenemies can be found here: A professor teaches us how to tell a friend from a frenemy https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2023/04/12/psychologists-define-what-the-term-frenemy-really-means/"
"Why Counting Cloud Costs Is Hot Of all the trends bubbling up in cloud technology, cloud costs and the potential for cloud repatriation are all the rage (other than AI). With economic conditions tightening, organizations are taking a very careful look at their cloud costs.\n\nRepatriation means bringing some infrastructure back in house from the cloud. But before you do that, you need to understand how much you are spending on cloud -- and where. These trends dovetail with yet another trend in cloud technology – governance and visibility. The people at the top want more information about how cloud services are being used in the organization. That means better tools for compliance, visibility, and security.\n\nNew technology is coming to market to help organizations get a handle on better visibility. Cloud Cost Management (CCM) and FinOps are the terms being used to describe this technology, which should help not only elevate visibility of costs and cloud usage but also help teams manage these costs. This will be a hot area to watch in 2023.\n\nIncreased visibility will enable management teams to make better decisions about cloud services – such as which services are cheaper or better. It will also enable them to weigh decisions about repatriation – the transfer of cloud technology back on-premises, into a private cloud infrastructure they can control better. Expect the debate about repatriation to gather steam as CCM and FinOps tools enable organizations to better understand their cloud costs.\n\nThis raging debate about cloud costs comes after a huge boom in cloud platforms, which have now become the focus of most IT deployments. But after 10 years of massive growth in cloud, there\'s still a lot of technology out there that\'s non-cloud, or on-premises.\n\nIn the early days of cloud, it was assumed that public cloud services could help industries lower the cost per bit of their compute and storage resources. Another factor was accounting. It was attractive to shift unpredictable capital costs to more accounting-friendly operating costs, or opex. In practice, cloud costs can be counted as opex, but it\'s still money! Many companies are now finding them to be nowhere close to ""cheap"" compared to on-prem resources.\n\nOf course, that\'s not to say that cloud has been a failure. It has accelerated the velocity at which enterprises can operate, and it lets them launch new services and digital products very quickly. The pandemic was a macro case study, showing how remote work and retail delivery programs could be rolled out in a matter of months. The cloud also has provided increased flexibility in how compute and storage resources are purchased. It also provides agility to procure more IT resources to support R&D, ongoing product development, and internal digital transformation efforts.\n\nIn recent survey research and discussions with practitioners, we have learned that many organizations are finding that cost is a new focus of cloud. They would like to find out if the costs of hosting in the cloud exceed what they would spend for on-prem resources.\n\n(FILE) The AWS Amazon Cloud Technology exhibition area at the World Intelligence Congress in ... [ ] Shanghai, August 31, 2019. AWS, Amazon Web Services, is Amazon\'s cloud computing IaaS and PaaS platform services. AWS provides users with a complete set of cloud computing services, including elastic computing, storage, databases, and applications, helping enterprises reduce IT input costs and maintenance costs. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nTo quote Peter Drucker, ""you can\'t manage what you can\'t measure."" The first step to understanding costs is to track and analyze them. Easier said than done. Many cloud services are still purchased in ad-hoc ways or by business lines operating in the ""shadow IT"" model. CEOs and CFOs are looking to put an end to this.\n\nCCM and FinOps tools are emerging to provide more sophisticated ways to measure and manage cloud costs, including evaluating the impact on adjacencies such as networking and security. Managers would also like to be able to assign costs to specific business units in order to add accountability.\n\nCloud management companies such as Flexera and Apptio are working on CCM and FinOps tools. Flexera has a FinOps module that integrates into the Flexera One platform, which can then be used as part of a comprehensive IT asset management strategy. Apptio is focused on understanding the costs of operating primarily in Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as understanding commitments to software-as-a-service (SaaS) implementations.\n\nPlatform tools, such as IBM\'s Turbonomics or CloudHealth from VMware, integrate easily into each vendor\'s larger suites and provide some level of visibility into usage as it is happening. However, they generally stop short of providing information that is useful for cost remediation conversations between finance and engineering teams. Virtana\'s Infrastructure Performance Management (IPM) is designed to give IT Leaders visibility across compute, network, and storage infrastructure. According to the company, Virtana IPM gathers data across an organization\'s architecture, detects anomalies causing performance issues, and provides AI-powered recommendations on how to resolve those issues.\n\nThere are also emerging solutions focused on arbitrage between cloud offerings and Kubernetes compute capabilities to reduce the cost of compute. For example, CAST AI is a promising startup that helps organizations understand Kubernetes costs across multiple vectors, including cost monitoring, security management, autoscaling, rightsizing, and spot instance automation. CAST AI has an interesting business model by which it charges customers by taking a percentage of the amount of money it saves on compute costs.\n\nThe networking world also has huge potential to add to the understanding of cloud costs. Cloud networking companies such as Aviatrix and Prosimo have realized that networking is a key enabler of cloud. It\'s also a lever that can be used to provide better visibility and management of access to cloud services. After all, cloud services are connected by networks.\n\nAviatrix\'s CostIQ uses distributed telemetry to measure usage of shared cloud networks and assign the results to appropriate cost centers. Prosimo\'s Full Stack Cloud Transit platform gains insights into application requirements and performance, which can be used to optimize cloud networking experiences and expense. Both companies are also working on other areas to optimize cloud expenses -- expect new products in this area from both of these companies very soon.\n\nToday, as many companies are dependent on a more complex cloud operating structure -- more cloud data, more cloud suppliers, better cloud data management needs, better cloud security needs, etc. -- the financial implications of the myriad of daily decisions can have a profound impact on that company\'s cloud bill and its overall operating budget. https://www.forbes.com/sites/rscottraynovich/2023/04/12/why-counting-cloud-costs-is-hot/"
"These 3 REITs Trade Below Book Value And Pay Dividends Although the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector has been suffering a steady downward trend for the last 12 to 18 months, it may be possible to identify bargains. By taking a value stock approach to REITs and identifying those with funds from operations (FFO) growth, trading below book value and paying dividends, the following three REITs seem to qualify.\n\nDynex Capital Inc. (NYSE: DX) is a mortgage REIT with a market capitalization of $659 million. It continues to be available for purchase at a significant discount to its book value of 25%. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 3.44 and no long-term debt, the REIT is displaying certain key qualities that value investors look for.\n\nFunds from operations over the most recent 12 months show growth of 14.2% and over the past five years of 18.2%. The price-to-sales ratio is 7.47, and the price-to-free-cash-flow metric sits at 12. Average daily volume for the REIT on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is 1.07 million shares.\n\nDynex pays a 12.69% dividend.\n\nHersha Hospitality Trust (NYSE: HT) is a hotel and motel operation that trades at just 37% of its book value alongside a price-to-earnings ratio of 2.17. The REIT's market capitalization is $249 million.\n\nShareholder equity slightly exceeds the amount of long-term debt on the books. Price to free cash flow is 4.79 and price to sales measures 0.61.\n\nOver the past five years, funds from operations increased by 12.1% and over the most recently reported 12 months at 284%. The REIT is relatively lightly traded for a NYSE-listed security with an average daily volume of 674,00 shares. The short float is 3.36%.\n\nHersha pays a dividend of 3.13%.\n\nRPT Realty (NYSE: RPT) has a market capitalization of $780 million and trades at a 9% discount from book value. The retail REIT has a price-to-earnings ratio of 10, price to sales at 3.58 and price to free cash flow of 11.57, the REIT pays a 6.02% dividend.\n\nIn the past five years, funds from operations show an increase of 2.8% and over the last 12 months of 19.7%.\n\nLong-term debt is about equal to shareholder equity.\n\nThis is another real estate investment trust that is relatively lightly traded with an average daily volume of 468,000 shares.\n\nNo guarantees exist that such an approach could lead to inevitable profitability. The Federal Reserve's determination to maintain higher interest rates and the difficulties of the banking sector may continue to weigh on securities for longer than one might think.\n\nNot investment advice.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nSlowly but surely, JetBlue is becoming a player in the transatlantic travel market. This week\'s announcement of nonstop service from NY and Boston to Amsterdam is perfectly timed for the summer travel market.\n\nAdding Amsterdam brings to three the number of European cities served by JetBlue, just as the peak season takes off. The company started with London in 2021, is moving on to Paris this June, and will soon fly to the premier Dutch destination. JetBlue European travel information is here.\n\nThe new JetBlue service between New York\'s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) is set to start late this summer. Service between Boston Logan and Amsterdam will follow, assuming receipt of government operating authority.\n\nParis and London (JetBlue flies to both Heathrow and Gatwick) are massive tourist draws. But Amsterdam is also a tempting destination, particularly for Millennials and Generation Z, whether chasing canals, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, tulips or the cannabis café culture.\n\nTravel to the Netherlands hit a peak in 2019, attracting 1.56 million Americans for at least one night. But like so many other destinations, that number plunged in 2020 during the pandemic, to just 266,000. While travel numbers have started to improve, demand for the Dutch destination should strengthen this year.\n\nPanorama of Amsterdam. Famous canals und bridges at warm afternoon light. Netherlands.\n\nJetBlue can capitalize on that bottled-up demand with a relatively limited investment. They just need to point a couple of their new Airbus A321LR long-range aircraft towards Amsterdam instead of London, Paris or another 3500–4000-mile route.\n\nJoanna Geraghty, President & COO of JetBlue, told me when they launched London service in 2021 in the midst of the pandemic, ""If service to London doesn\'t work out we can point to the US West Coast."" With service to Europe expanding rather than contracting, transatlantic service seems to be a bright spot for JetBlue.\n\nEven the stock market gave the news tepid applause, with JetBlue\'s battered stock rising  2.12% on April 12. JetBlue is currently the #6 carrier in the U.S.\n\nBut the company\'s plan to grow by merging with Spirit Airlines in a $3.8 billion dollar deal has been challenged by the Justice Department. An October 16 trial has been set. JetBlue is also waiting for a verdict in another anti-competitiveness case filed by the Justice Department. That seeks to force American Airlines and JetBlue to end their U.S. Northeast partnership because it would allegedly mean higher prices for consumers.\n\nOn the bright side, JetBlue management saw an opportunity in a recent court ruling in the Netherlands. The court ruled that the Dutch government failed to follow the law when it sought to limit flights at Amsterdam\'s Schiphol\'s airport, giving JetBlue confidence there will be room to enter the market.\n\n""We\'re confident that customers, Amsterdam airport officials, and the Dutch government will be delighted by JetBlue when they see first-hand the positive impact we can make. We look forward to working together with Dutch officials to ensure long-term success in the market,"" said Robin Hayes, chief executive officer, JetBlue. ""This route is long overdue for some competition.""\n\nJetBlue aircraft showing its \'mood lighting\' and 11"" seatback screens. JetBlue is one of a handful ... [ ] of American airlines to offer seatback screens on all aircraft, as other airlines will simply stream to the passenger\'s electronic devices.\n\nJetBlue sees the new route as a way to introduce more European travelers to the company\'s upscale version of low-fare travel. JetBlue is currently the sixth largest airline in the U.S. It is known for having the most legroom in coach (as they put it, ""Based on personal square footage per passenger seat""). It also offers live television and on-demand entertainment on every seatback, as well as"" free and fast"" Fly-Fi broadband internet.\n\nHaving an 11"" video screen on the seatback in front of you these days is a big deal. Many of JetBlue\'s competitors, such as Alaska and Southwest, don\'t have screens, although most airlines do stream movies, TV shows and other entertainment. But if you\'ve ever tried to watch a two-hour movie on a smartphone in mid-flight, you\'ll appreciate a built-in screen.\n\nFlights will operate daily on JetBlue\'s Airbus A321LR aircraft with 24 Mint Suite seats and 114 core (coach) seats. JetBlue Mint features 24 fully lie-flat private suites with a sliding door and a custom-designed seat cushion from mattress company Tuft & Needle.\n\nAnd wherever you sit, you can take advantage of the extra-large overhead bins in the Airbus A321LR. JetBlue says that all customers, regardless of fare type, can bring one carry-on and one personal item.\n\nJetBlue says whether they sit in coach or JetBlue\'s Mint Suite, passengers will get menus of fresh seasonal food and their choice of beer, wine, and liquor, all included with their ticket. Travelers can also fortify themselves for a visit to Amsterdam\'s coffee shops with Dunkin\' coffee, juices, or other soft drinks.\n\nSome of the fresh menu items offered on JetBlue transatlantic flights, prepared through their ... [ ] partnership with New York\'s Dig restaurant group.\n\nEuropeans traveling to the U.S. might also take advantage of additional Jet Blue flights to more than 100 destinations throughout the United States, Latin America, Caribbean, and Canada.\n\nWill JetBlue be successful in disrupting the lucrative Transatlantic market?\n\n""For too long the U.S. legacy carriers, backed by their joint ventures with other global airlines that enjoy immunity from antitrust laws, have locked customers in with very expensive fares and mediocre service,"" said Robin Hayes, JetBlue\'s CEO. ""Just like we\'re doing in London and Paris, we will bring fares down and improve the experience for customers flying between the U.S. and Amsterdam. https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2023/04/12/jetblue-adds-amsterdam-to-london-paris-european-service/"

[ ] Grand Garden Arena on April 03, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)\n\nAlmost exactly 15 years after it was first unleashed onto the world, Lady Gaga\'s debut single ""Just Dance"" has just just been gifted one of the greatest honors possible in the music industry…and it helps her tie two of her most successful contemporaries.\n\n""Just Dance"" has officially been certified diamond by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), the organization tasked with confirming how many units artists, albums and songs shift in the U.S. and then designating them gold, platinum and beyond.\n\nAny musical release can collect a diamond certification in America after moving at least 10 million equivalent units, which is the same as saying 10-times platinum.\n\nIn fact, ""Just Dance"" jumps from nine-times platinum to 11-times platinum status in one fell swoop. It earned its last plaque back in March 2020, and since then, fans have continued to buy and stream the cut constantly, helping it rise the ranks and collect more of these awards.\n\nEarning a diamond certification remains a feat reserved for only the biggest releases and artists in the business, but it\'s something Gaga has managed before. ""Just Dance"" is the superstar\'s third diamond single. ""Bad Romance"" is also an 11-times platinum smash, while ""Poker Face""–the song that immediately followed ""Just Dance""–is steady at diamond status.\n\nGaga is now tied for the most diamond-certified singles among women, as both Katy Perry and Cardi B have also earned as many of these wins.\n\nPerry\'s biggest hit thus far is ""Firework,"" which ranks as one of the most successful singles ever, as it has already been certified 12-times platinum. Behind that cut come ""Dark Horse"" at 11-times platinum and ""Roar,"" which is another diamond win.\n\nFor her part, Cardi B\'s singles ""I Like It"" with J Balvin and Bad Bunny and ""Bodak Yellow"" are both 11-times platinum smash hits, while ""Girls Like You"" is a diamond release. That last cut was initially dropped by Maroon 5 alone, but once she hopped on a remix, it rocketed to No. 1 on the Hot 100 and racked up at least 10 million equivalent sales. https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2023/04/12/lady-gaga-ties-cardi-b-and-katy-perry-for-the-most-diamond-certified-singles-among-women/"

"What Happens Next in the Fight Over Abortion Pills Now that a Texas judge has ruled that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\'s approval of the abortion pill, mifepristone, is suspended, what happens to the supply of the drug?\n\nThe judge gave the Department of Justice (DOJ), which represents the FDA, until Apr. 14 to file an appeal before the suspension of the drug takes place. Both the DOJ and the drug\'s maker, Danco, have filed appeals asking the Fifth Circuit Court to issue a stay on removing the drug\'s approval.\n\nMaking things more complicated, soon after the Texas judge\'s ruling, a district court judge in Washington issued an opposing decision: that the FDA should keep mifepristone on the market and was prohibited from blocking access to the drug. That decision was in response to a lawsuit filed by attorneys general in 17 states and the District of Columbia who questioned the FDA\'s requirement that doctors who prescribe mifepristone and pharmacies who dispense it be certified.\n\nIf the appeals court does not grant a stay on the Texas judge\'s decision in time, the drug would technically no longer be approved. But because no judge has called for the suspension of the FDA\'s approval before, experts are divided over what that means for mifepristone.\n\nSome think the FDA might have what\'s called ""enforcement discretion,"" which legal experts are interpreting in different ways. Some believe this discretion allows the agency to decide not to enforce the judge\'s order to suspend approval of the drug. In that case, the FDA would notify the manufacturer that it was providing safe harbor for the company to continue making and distributing the drug, says Sonia Suter, professor of law and director of the health law initiative at George Washington University. A 1985 Supreme Court decision supports such an action, stating that the FDA has broad enforcement discretion.\n\nOthers aren\'t confident that the agency\'s enforcement discretion applies in this situation, noting that it\'s meant more for the FDA to modify its own rules and regulations when circumstances warrant. A recent example of such a situation occurred in 2021, when the FDA removed the restriction on mifepristone that required patients to get the medication in person from a certified health care provider.\n\nDoctors and clinics that currently have supplies of the drug will be looking to the FDA to determine what they do with their doses. But there is no precedent for what happens to drugs when it\'s not the FDA--but a judge--that decides they are no longer approved.\n\nIf the agency does follow the judge\'s ruling and declares mifepristone no longer an approved drug, then ""it is technically unlawful to prescribe or dispense a drug that isn\'t authorized or approved by the FDA,"" says Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on Public Health Law & Human Rights at Georgetown Law.\n\nRead More: Why Republicans Are Overreaching So Hard in So Many States\n\nBut Kirsten Moore, director of the EMAA Project, an organization that helps expand access to medication abortion, believes doses already in the hands of health care providers could still be prescribed and dispensed. Because the Texas judge did not specify any action that the FDA had to take, such as removing the drug from the market, she says, those doses could be used. She points to a precedent from a recent FDA decision to withdraw approval of Makena, a drug that prevents premature birth, based on additional evidence that the medication wasn\'t effective. In revoking its approval, the agency said ""some health care providers might continue to prescribe or administer that limited remaining supply to their patients,"" although the FDA urged doctors to consider the agency\'s decision that the risks outweighed the benefits of doing so.\n\n""The Makena example gives us some information that once a drug is in interstate commerce, it\'s considered still there,"" says Moore.\n\nRemoving a drug from the market is a highly regulated process that is laid out in the FDA\'s statute. It requires the FDA commissioner and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue withdrawal notices, provide the reasons for the withdrawal, and give the manufacturer time to respond to those reasons. Having a judge suspend approval of a drug ""is not what the statue requires for withdrawal of a drug,"" says Suter. ""It\'s not the right process.""\n\nSome states are not taking any chances on what might happen to the availability of mifepristone, which is used not just for abortions but also to manage miscarriages. Massachusetts has already ordered 15,000 doses of mifepristone, enough to treat a typical number of patients in the state for a year. California has purchased 2 million pills of misoprostol, an FDA-approved drug for treating ulcers that is used off-label to induce abortions early in pregnancy in combination with mifepristone. Used alone, it can also induce an abortion, although it causes more side effects and the two medications together are more effective. Misoprostol is poised to become the backup plan for medication abortions as the courts continue to debate the status of mifepristone.\n\nIn the 18 jurisdictions affected by the Washington ruling, says Suter, doctors may have more confidence in continuing to prescribe mifepristone even if the appeals court does not issue a stay on the Texas judge\'s decision.\n\n""Doctors could be bold and think, \'I have one authority supporting me to continue prescribing the drug, so I will risk it,\'"" says Suter. ""Or they could be conservative and decide it\'s too confusing and switch to the alternative of misoprostol."" Given the uncertainty, many providers may err on the side of caution and be more reluctant to prescribe mifepristone for fear of being sued or losing their license if their state licensing boards view the abortion pills as an unapproved drug.\n\nOnline access to abortion pills may also be narrowing. In his ruling, the Texas judge invoked the Comstock Act, an 1873 law that prohibits sending any ""instrument, substance, drug, medicine or thing"" that could be used for abortion. In a 2022 opinion, however, the DOJ clarified that it was not illegal to send abortion medications by mail as long as the sender ""lacks the intent that the recipient of the drugs will use them unlawfully."" Still, in his ruling, the Texas judge cited Comstock with a strict reading of ""intent,"" opening up the possibility that sending mifepristone by mail to any state, regardless of whether the state bans or allows abortion, would be illegal.\n\nRead More: What Nine Months Means to a Pregnant Person\n\nThat could make medication abortion less convenient for everyone, even for those in states where abortion is legal. People in those states can currently have a telehealth visit and get a prescription sent to a mail-order pharmacy and then delivered to their home, but soon they may now have to go in person to obtain the pills, since mailing them could be illegal.\n\nU.S. residents could still order mifepristone from overseas, since the Comstock Act does not apply to non-U.S. providers. Aid Access, a Europe-based provider of abortion pills, ships medications from abroad for those who live in states where abortion is banned, and from U.S. sites for those who live in states where abortion is allowed.\n\nWhile current abortion laws in states only criminalize providers of abortion in the U.S., if current anti-abortion political and judicial pressures continue, Suter says ""the next move would be to criminalize the behavior of the patient."" Already, she says, prosecutors in some states have gotten creative with their tactics, including by using child abuse and neglect laws, to hold women who use self-induced abortions accountable.\n\nFor now, health providers and legal scholars are waiting for the decision of the appeals court to determine how the right to medication abortions will change. Many states and health providers were turning to abortion pills as a solution to the narrowing availability of abortion procedures in U.S. states; for women who don\'t have easy access to surgical abortions, the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol provided a safe and reliable alternative.\n\n""Mifepristone was something that was going to help relieve some pressure on clinics in states where abortion is still legal, because those clinics were seeing a big influx of patients from states where abortion is banned,"" says Liz Borkowski, managing director of the Jacobs Institute of Women\'s Health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health of George Washington University. ""We were hoping access was about to improve in states where abortion is legal. But this could actually reverse that.""\n\nContact us at letters@time.com. https://time.com/6270733/abortion-pill-ruling-fda-explained/"
"Top Silver Stocks for Q2 2023 Silver mining companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of mineral properties. These companies often mine for other metals and minerals besides silver, such as zinc, lead, copper, and gold. Silver is often a byproduct produced from mining these other metals. Some big names in the industry include Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (WPM), Hecla Mining Co. (HL), and SSR Mining Inc. (SSRM).\n\nAfter a volatile year, silver futures have nearly recovered to levels last seen in April 2022. Though silver stocks, represented by the Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL), have underperformed the broader market over the past year. SIL has returned -17% over the past 12 months, well below the benchmark Russell 1000's total return of -8%.\n\nHere are the top three silver stocks with the best value, the fastest growth, and the best performance. All data are as of April 10.\n\nThese are the silver stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. For companies in the early stages of development or industries suffering from major shocks, this can be substituted as a rough measure of a business's value. A business with higher sales eventually could produce more profit when it either achieves or returns to profitability. The P/S ratio shows how much you're paying for the stock for each dollar of sales generated.\n\nThese are the top silver stocks as ranked by a growth model that scores companies based on a 50/50 weighting of their most recent quarterly YOY percentage revenue growth and their most recent quarterly YOY earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. Both sales and earnings are critical factors in the success of a company. Therefore ranking companies by only one growth metric makes a ranking susceptible to the accounting anomalies of that quarter (such as changes in tax law or restructuring costs) that may make one or the other figure unrepresentative of the business in general. Companies with quarterly EPS or revenue growth of over 1,000% were excluded as outliers.\n\nThese are the silver stocks that had the best returns or smallest declines in total return over the past 12 months out of the companies we looked at.\n\nSilver has a wide variety of applications in many industries. It is a key material used in electrical components for computers, phones, and automobiles. Perhaps even more important for investors is the crucial role that silver plays in the renewable energy industry. Silver is an important component of photovoltaic technology such as solar cells because of its conductive properties. Solar photovoltaic energy generation continues to grow at a rapid pace. This suggests that silver will continue to be in high demand as demand for solar energy products increases.\n\nSilver is valued both as an industrial metal and as a precious metal. It is used in jewelry, electronics, and photography. Many investors use it as a safe haven in times of economic turmoil and sometimes as a hedge against inflation.\n\nBut the market for silver is smaller than the market for gold, and consequently it tends to experience higher levels of volatility, which may impact the stock prices of silver mining companies. Another risk to investors is that there aren't many pure-play silver miners in the mining industry. Rather, silver is often one of several different minerals mined by a single company. This means that mining company stocks may be impacted by factors related to materials other than silver. Investors should focus on the role that silver mining plays in a company's operations before allocating their funds. https://www.investopedia.com/top-silver-stocks-q2-2023-7377837"

"ChatGPT can turn toxic just by changing its assigned persona, researchers say Join top executives in San Francisco on July 11-12, to hear how leaders are integrating and optimizing AI investments for success. Learn More\n\nChatGPT can be inadvertently or maliciously set to turn toxic just by changing its assigned persona in the model\'s system settings, according to new research from the Allen Institute for AI.\n\nThe study -- which the researchers say is the first large-scale toxicity analysis of ChatGPT -- found that the large language model (LLM) carries inherent toxicity that is heightened up to six times when assigned a diverse range of personas (such as historical figures, profession, etc). Nearly 100 personas from diverse backgrounds were examined across over half a million ChatGPT output generations -- including journalists, politicians, sportspersons and businesspersons, as well as different races, genders and sexual orientations.\n\nThese system settings to assign personas can significantly change ChatGPT output. ""The responses can in fact be wildly different, all the way from the writing style to the content itself,"" Tanmay Rajpurohit, one of the study authors, told VentureBeat in an interview. And the settings can be accessed by anyone building on ChatGPT using OpenAI\'s API, so the impact of this toxicity could be widespread. For example, chatbots and plugins built on ChatGPT from companies such as Snap, Instacart and Shopify could exhibit toxicity.\n\nThe research is also significant because while many have assumed ChatGPT\'s bias is in the training data, the researchers show that the model can develop an ""opinion"" about the personas themselves, while different topics also elicit different levels of toxicity.\n\nJoin us in San Francisco on July 11-12, where top executives will share how they have integrated and optimized AI investments for success and avoided common pitfalls. https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpt-can-turn-toxic-just-by-changing-its-assigned-persona-researchers-say/"
"This 12%-Yielding ETF Pays Large Monthly Dividends ETFs that pay monthly dividends and utilize a strategy of selling covered calls to generate income have grown in popularity in recent years. While this strategy is receiving an influx of attention, it isn\'t necessarily new. In fact, an ETF called the Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD), launched in 2013, currently boasts an eye-catching yield of 12%.\n\nWhile the ETF holds appeal for income investors, there are also several things that investors should be aware of before jumping in right after seeing that eye-popping yield. Let\'s take a closer look at this monthly dividend payer from Global X and whether it could be a fit for your portfolio.\n\nFrom a pure income perspective, it\'s hard to beat QYLD\'s yield of 12%. This double-digit yield is more than twice the rate of inflation, and it dwarfs the average yield of the S&P 500 and the yield of the ten-year treasury. It also beats the yields of many other popular dividend and high-yield ETFs. Furthermore, QYLD has a reliable track record in that it has paid monthly dividends to investors for nine years in a row.\n\nHigh-Scoring Holdings\n\nAs a fund focused on the NASDAQ 100 index, you won\'t be surprised to find that QYLD\'s top holdings consist largely of the mega cap tech stocks that dominate the tech-centric index. Tech behemoths like Microsoft and Apple enjoy double-digit weightings here, while other top tech stocks like Amazon, Nvidia, both share classes of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom are all top-ten holdings.\n\nIt\'s not until the tenth-largest position, Pepsi, that you come across a non-tech stock.\n\nBelow, you\'ll find an overview of QYLD\'s top holdings, using TipRanks\' holdings screen.\n\nOne thing that stands out about QYLD\'s top holdings is that you\'ll find a lot of impressive Smart Scores here. QYLD owns a strong collection of blue chip tech and growth stocks. Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet shares all have perfect 10 out of 10 ratings, while Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Pepsi all have smart scores of 8 or above, which is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nTo this end, QYLD has earned an impressive ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10, reflecting several positive indicators such as bullish blogger sentiment and growing hedge fund involvement.\n\nSmart Score is TipRanks\' proprietary quantitative stock scoring system that evaluates stocks on eight different market factors. The result is data-driven and does not involve any human intervention.\n\nThe Strategy Behind QYLD\'s Double-Digit Yield\n\nAfter looking through QYLD\'s top holdings, you might be noticing that outside of Pepsi and perhaps Broadcom, none of these names are really noted as dividend stocks (many don\'t pay a dividend at all), and wondering how QYLD generates a double-digit yield from this basket of holdings.\n\nQYLD implements a strategy known as a ""covered call"" or ""buy-write,"" whereby the fund purchases stocks from the Nasdaq 100 Index and simultaneously sells corresponding call options on the same index.\n\nEssentially, QYLD is selling covered calls against the positions it owns and it collects options premiums to generate additional income and achieve this high yield. This isn\'t a bad strategy; it\'s similar to the ones employed by JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) and JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), and it certainly generates a high yield.\n\nHowever, one thing that investors should be aware of is that as is the case with JEPI and JEPQ, selling covered calls against these positions will likely limit some of QYLD\'s upside in an environment where tech and growth stocks are surging.\n\nLong-term Performance\n\nThe possibility of capped upside is one cause for concern that investors should be aware of. The other is the ETF\'s long-term performance. With annualized total returns of about 6.7% since inception in 2013, QYLD investors have made money. However, while they didn\'t lose money, there is an opportunity cost -- QYLD has underperformed the NASDAQ 100 itself (its benchmark index), and it has underperformed simply investing in the S&P 500. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is just something that investors should keep an eye on.\n\nFurther to this point, QYLD\'s expense ratio of 0.6% is far more expensive than the expense ratios of these simple broad-market strategies which have outperformed it over time -- QQQ has an expense ratio of 0.2%, while SPY\'s is just 0.09%.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for QYLD?\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, QYLD is currently rated as a Moderate Buy, with an average price target of $19.38. This target represents an upside potential of approximately 13% from the ETF\'s current market value.\n\nTipRanks uses proprietary technology to compile analyst forecasts and price targets for ETFs based on a combination of the individual performances of the underlying assets. Further, TipRanks calculates a weighted average based on the combination of all the ETFs\' holdings. The average price forecast for an ETF is calculated by multiplying each individual holding\'s price target by its weighting within the ETF and adding them all up.\n\nQYLD certainly has some things going for it, like its outsize yield and its collection of blue chip with strong Smart Scores. However, like almost any strategy, it has its pros and cons, and the two main drawbacks here is the limited upside potential thanks to the covered call strategy and the fund\'s long-term performance, which has lagged the strategy of simply investing in the NASDAQ or S&P 500 while costing investors more in the process.\n\nFor a dividend investor specifically looking to add yield to their portfolio, QYLD is an option to consider, and I give it credit for its reliable long-term history of monthly payouts. However, I personally am not looking to dive in solely based on the yield and I wouldn\'t allocate a large portion of my portfolio to it based on these factors. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-yielding-etf-pays-large-163748797.html"

"Inside Ukraine's Bloody Stand for Bakhmut The route passes the destroyed village of Ivanivske, where the cherry trees were blooming amid the ruins this week. From there on, every few hundred yards, a burned or blown-up vehicle had been shoved onto the shoulder.\n\n""It\'s going to get bumpy,"" the driver of a mud-splattered Canadian-supplied armored car warned, before accelerating past a stretch exposed to Russian fire. Soldiers in the car lurched and bounced like shaken dolls.\n\nThe passable road means that Russia\'s effort to encircle the Ukrainian troops has failed, for now at least, forcing the Russian military to press ahead in the bloody, street-by-street assaults. Losses pile up daily.\n\nThe basement bunker, with a wood fire for warmth and a table laid with pickled tomatoes and plastic cups of tea for soldiers, is command central. From a screen, Colonel Palisa watched a drone video showing Russians running into a building, apparently planning an assault from there.\n\nHe radioed his artillery unit, which fires from the hills to the west of Bakhmut, using the call sign ""Houston,"" as if supporting an expedition in space.

"Post-Pandemic Telehealth Prescriptions: Here's What May Change for You     - CNET Some changes to how we\'re able to get prescriptions online are likely coming soon. In late February, the US Drug Enforcement Administration proposed changes to pandemic rules that will affect certain controlled medications that are more strictly regulated by the government once the public health emergency for COVID-19 expires on May 11.\n\nIn a nutshell, patients who were prescribed controlled drugs during the pandemic would need to see a provider in person at least once to maintain their prescription. New patients would still be able to get a month\'s supply for many of these drugs, but would then need to see their provider in person.\n\nThe pandemic-era telemedicine boom has been a silver lining for many people over the last three years, at least from a health care access perspective. Along with the burst of new companies offering online health care, restrictions on how providers could treat and prescribe controlled medications were loosened, removing the need for a patient to see a doctor face to face for some key medications, including those for mental health and opioid addiction.\n\nFirst, the good news: Prescriptions for many common medications and drugs will stay available via online consultation once the public health emergency ends. Common medications that people take to manage a health condition (insulin, blood pressure medication, birth control and more) won\'t be affected.\n\nThe DEA proposes that the new rules, which include specific record-keeping requirements by the telehealth provider, may help curb misuse of controlled medications, which include popular drugs such as Adderall. While there are blind spots in telemedicine, broader telemedicine access has provided health care access for those who don\'t have an easy time meeting with a provider in person, including people who live in rural areas or who have difficulty getting time off from work. While officials are keeping some aspects of telemedicine open, some experts worry that adding back in-person requirements or referrals will be a barrier to many people who\'ve benefited from telemedicine.\n\nIf they\'re finalized (nothing is set in stone now), the rules will change care for some patients, though there are things you can do to prepare. There\'s also a proposed grace period for people who were given prescriptions during the pandemic via telemedicine.\n\nHere\'s what we know.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many people embraced telemedicine services, including for increased access to health care for those who may not have it otherwise.\n\nAs of now, the pandemic rules for telemedicine are still in effect – the new ones may replace them when the public health emergency for COVID-19 ends on May 11. (The DEA just wrapped up a public comment period, during which citizens and health care groups submitted opinions on the proposal.) If they do change, it\'ll affect medications differently depending on how they\'re scheduled: The DEA classifies them based on its perception of the potential for misuse and how the drug is used medically. Schedule I drugs are the most restricted class and include drugs you\'d have to buy illegally in many circumstances, including cannabis, LSD and more. At the other end, schedule V drugs include some painkillers and cough medicines, such as Robitussin.\n\nIf the proposed rules go into effect and you have a prescription for a schedule II drug, which includes Adderall and Ritalin, you\'ll need to see a provider face to face in order to fill, or refill, a prescription. If you haven\'t had a non-telemedicine visit with a provider, you\'ll need to get one in order to continue your treatment.\n\nFor some common anxiety medications, at-home ketamine treatment, drugs for opioid misuse and more, new patients will be able to get a month\'s supply of medication (30 days) but will need to find an in-person provider to continue their treatment and get a refill. This includes drugs like Ambien, Xanax and buprenorphine. Testosterone, which many transgender patients take as a part of their hormone therapy, is also controlled and will require an in-person appointment. Estrogen is not a controlled drug.\n\nHere\'s a list of controlled substances so you can find out which class your medication is in. Here is a graphic the DEA has for its proposed rule changes. To be certain about how your medication is classified and how the rules will affect your particular case, check with your prescriber.\n\nThen some wiggle room comes in. According to information from the DEA for medical practitioners, prescriptions written during the COVID-19 pandemic (from when the public health emergency was first declared in 2020 up until its expiration next month) you\'ll have an additional 180 days to get a referral or an in-person evaluation to keep your prescription active. This should apply to all medications, but check with your provider for specific details on prescriptions. (As with all rules in the proposal, this too might change with the finalized version.)\n\nMany common medications you\'d be prescribed at an urgent care or by your family doctor (such as antibiotics, birth control and insulin) are not controlled as strictly by the government and won\'t be affected by the changed rules, so you\'d still be able to get them via telemedicine.\n\nBuprenorphine is one of a few medications people can take to manage opioid use disorder, including addiction to heroin. It\'s essentially a weaker version of methadone. If the new rules go into effect, people who get their first prescription for buprenorphine will need to find an in-person provider within a month in order to keep their treatment – something that many addiction specialists have said poses a barrier to critical treatment.\n\nDuring the pandemic, there was a burst of online ADHD diagnoses and prescriptions, particularly among younger women. Sites including ADHD Online, Cerebral and Done will all have to abide by the DEA\'s rules for new prescriptions, should they go into effect later this spring.\n\nAccording to steps patients need to take in order to keep their prescription active posted by ADHD Online, people with a prescription for something like Adderall will also likely be part of the pandemic-inspired 180-day grace period, meaning you should have until early November to make an appointment or find a ""qualifying telemedicine referral"" to stay a patient on the site.\n\nWithout the right connections, finding a provider that\'s able to prescribe controlled medication can be tricky, and expensive. As a good first step, contact your insurance company if you have health insurance and ask them to help guide you. You can also follow these medication-specific tips below.\n\nFinding an ADHD provider\n\nIf you\'re a new patient looking for a new prescription of stimulant medication (schedule II drugs like Adderall) after May 11, you\'ll need to find an in-person provider who can diagnose and prescribe medication.\n\nAdditude Magazine, a publication for people with ADHD, published a guide for what patients should consider when looking for a provider. It\'s also worth noting that not all ADHD medications are stimulants, and non-stimulant types will have different rules than Adderall, for example.\n\nGeneral tips finding a mental health provider\n\nBecause the DEA\'s rules apply to the prescriptions of drugs, mental health support will still be available through many telemedicine or online therapy companies – whether you\'re looking for help with anxiety, depression, ADHD or something else. Here\'s a list of the best online therapy options out there right now, as well as best psychiatry services.\n\nHelp finding opioid use therapy\n\nBuprenorphine can be prescribed at a physicians\' office, and new patients will be able to get a month\'s supply if they start treatment online after the DEA\'s post-pandemic rules are in place. Then you\'ll need to find another provider to keep with the treatment.\n\nIf you don\'t have a primary care doctor, checking with your local health department would be a great first step. If you started a prescription during the pandemic, your buprenorphine prescription will be carried for the additional 180 days, which means you\'ll have a few extra months to find an in-person appointment. Big cities might have a directory of places and phone numbers especially for opioid addiction treatment, like this one in New York City.\n\nPeople living in rural areas with fewer health care centers may have to travel longer distances to find health care. To help narrow down your search, the US Department of Health and Human Services has a provider search. To use it, type in your ZIP code and distance you\'re able to travel.\n\nFor help finding hormone therapy\n\nPatients taking testosterone for gender-affirming care will also need to abide by any updated telemedicine rules post-pandemic. Again, patients living in more rural areas may have a harder time finding an in-person provider to maintain a prescription.\n\nIf you don\'t know where to look, contacting your local Planned Parenthood would be a good resource. Even if the branch doesn\'t prescribe your particular hormone therapy, they may be able to refer you to another location that does. And as is true for other health care services, if you don\'t have a primary care doctor, you can find and call your local health department in order to connect you to someone who can get your medication.\n\nThis story will be updated when the proposed rules go into effect, including any changes to what the DEA has planned right now. https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/post-pandemic-telehealth-prescriptions-heres-what-may-change-for-you/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"Trine 5 gives the series' heroes some new abilities Connect with top gaming leaders in Los Angeles at GamesBeat Summit 2023 this May 22-23. Register here.\n\nTHQ Nordic has pulled back the curtain on the next game in the Trine series, called Trine 5: A Clockwork Conspiracy. GamesBeat recently got the chance to take a peek at the upcoming game. We saw some of its gameplay, including puzzle and combat sections. It has a lot of the series\' familiar vibes, being a 2.5D puzzle platformer, though the three heroes are given a few more abilities.\n\nAs is typical for Trine games, the series gameplay is based around environmental puzzles more than combat. There is combat in the game, and the heroes can hold their own. However, most of the work that players will be doing is figuring out how to mold the environment to let them progress. Pontius the Knight now has the ability to wedge his sword into flat surfaces, letting him create a new surface from which to jump. Zoya the Thief gets ricochet arrows, an upgrade from Trine 4\'s DLC. Players can upgrade characters\' skills with XP.\n\nTrine 5 is also gorgeous, with the series\' signature bright, colorful art design on full display. This game appears to lean into the clockpunk aesthetic of previous Trine titles. This is in keeping with the game\'s story, which features two villains in charge of a clockwork army. One slightly disappointing feature is the lives system, which feels like a relic.\n\nThe series still feels like it\'s trying to recover from the disappointment of Trine 3. That game shifted from the series core gameplay and style to a fan-disappointing degree. Trine 5 looks much more like older games in the series, such as Trine 2, and seems to play like them as well. From the glimpse we were given, fans of the original Trine games may find this a return to form.\n\nGamesBeat\'s creed when covering the game industry is ""where passion meets business."" What does this mean? We want to tell you how the news matters to you -- not just as a decision-maker at a game studio, but also as a fan of games.

"Apple Supplier Cirrus Logic Hammered On Rumored iPhone 15 Change Apple (AAPL) will likely abandon a highly anticipated feature in its iPhone 15 Pro models, according to a report Wednesday that hammered supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS). CRUS stock hit a three-month low.\n\nDue to unresolved technical issues, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max probably won\'t feature solid-state buttons, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a Medium post. These buttons would have replaced the physical power and volume buttons and instead relied on haptic feedback from users.\n\n""Investors had anticipated that the new solid-state button design would increase suppliers\' revenue and profits,"" according to the report. ""Thus, this change is particularly unfavorable for Cirrus Logic and AAC Technologies.""\n\nIn morning trading on today\'s stock market, CRUS stock went into free fall, diving 14.3% near 87.30. Shares of AAC Technology Holdings (AACAY), which trade over the counter, slumped 14.9% near 2. Apple stock inched 0.2% ahead, trading near 161.10.\n\nThe iPhone 15 is still in the earliest stage of development, so there\'s still time for Apple to make some changes, according to the report.\n\n""Based on these factors, removing solid-state buttons should have limited impact on the mass production schedule and shipments for Pro models,"" Kuo said.\n\nBut CRUS stock took a hit on the report. The company is Apple\'s exclusive supplier for a key component in the rumored solid-state buttons. AAC and Luxshare ICT supply Apple with another component, but larger Luxshare will be less affected because it has a significantly larger operating scale, Kuo said.\n\nRepresentatives of Cirrus Logic, AAC and Apple didn\'t immediately return requests for comment from Investor\'s Business Daily.\n\nShares of Cirrus Logic have soared this year. They broke out of a flat base with a buy point at 108.52 in late March, according to MarketSmith.com. CRUS stock later fell as much as 6.5% below that entry, putting the breakout at risk. Investors should sell when a stock falls 7%-8% below its buy point.\n\nThe news Wednesday put highly rated CRUS stock well below that buy point.\n\nShares have a strong IBD Digital Relative Strength Rating of 95, which puts them in the top 5% of all stocks when it comes to 12-month performance.

"Streaming Services Urged To Clamp Down on AI-Generated Music Universal Music Group has told streaming platforms, including Spotify and Apple, to block artificial intelligence services from scraping melodies and lyrics from their copyrighted songs, according to emails viewed by the Financial Times. From the report: UMG, which controls about a third of the global music market, has become increasingly concerned about AI bots using their songs to train themselves to churn out music that sounds like popular artists. AI-generated songs have been popping up on streaming services and UMG has been sending takedown requests ""left and right,"" said a person familiar with the matter. The company is asking streaming companies to cut off access to their music catalogue for developers using it to train AI technology. ""We will not hesitate to take steps to protect our rights and those of our artists,"" UMG wrote to online platforms in March, in emails viewed by the FT. ""This next generation of technology poses significant issues,"" said a person close to the situation. ""Much of [generative AI] is trained on popular music.

"White House Names Veterinary Drug Xylazine Mixed with Fentanyl an 'Emerging Threat' The U.S. has named a veterinary tranquilizer as an ""emerging threat"" when it\'s mixed with the powerful opioid fentanyl, clearing the way for more efforts to stop the spread of xylazine.\n\nThe Office of National Drug Control Policy announced the designation Wednesday, the first time the office has used it since the category for fast-growing drug dangers was created in 2019.\n\nDr. Rahul Gupta, director of the drug policy office, said xylazine (pronounced ZAI\'-luh-zeen) has become increasingly common in all regions of the country.\n\nIt was detected in about 800 drug deaths in the U.S. in 2020--most of them in the Northeast. By 2021, it was present in more than 3,000 fatalities--with the most in the South--according to a report last year from the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n""We cannot ignore what we\'re seeing,"" Gupta said. ""We must act and act now.""\n\nXylazine was approved for veterinary use in 1971. Sometimes known as ""tranq,"" it\'s been showing up in supplies of illicit drugs used by humans in major quantities in only the last several years.\n\nIt\'s believed to be added to other drugs to increase profits. Officials are trying to understand how much of it is diverted from veterinary uses and how much is made illicitly.\n\nThe drug causes breathing and heart rates to slow down, sometimes to deadly levels, and causes skin abscesses and ulcers that can require amputation. Withdrawal is also painful.\n\nWhile it\'s often used in conjunction with opioids, including fentanyl and related illicit lab-made drugs, it\'s not an opioid. And there are no known antidotes.\n\nGupta said his office is requesting $11 million as part of its budget to develop a strategy to tackle the drug\'s spread. Plans include developing an antidote, learning more about how it is introduced into illicit drug supplies so that can be disrupted, and looking into whether Congress should classify it as a controlled substance.\n\nGupta said it needs to be available for veterinary uses even amid crackdowns on the supply used by people. He also said systems to detect the drug and data about where it\'s being used need to be improved.\n\nThe drug is part of a deepening overdose crisis in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 107,000 people died from overdoses in the 12 months that ended Oct. 31, 2022. Before 2020, the number of overdose deaths had never topped 100,000.\n\nMost of the deaths were linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Like xylazine, they\'re often added to other drugs--and users don\'t always know they\'re getting them.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com. https://time.com/6270916/xylazine-fentanyl-dangers/"

"40 unique Mother's Day gifts for the coolest moms you know There aren\'t enough gifts in the world to convey our appreciation for all the cool moms out there this Mother\'s Day, but we can certainly try. From fire pits and massage guns to the coolest tech on the market, this is the time to give unique Mother\'s Day gifts to the maternal figure in your life that are both something she\'ll actually use and something (almost nearly) as cool as her.\n\nWe\'ve rounded up the most unique Mother\'s Day gifts to add to your cart that are sure to inspire some laughs, tears or both.\n\nWhether she spends most of the day hunched over a computer or has just taken up barre, chances are Mom can use a massage. Gift her the widely beloved Theragun Mini, the smallest and cheapest of Therabody\'s offerings that boasts three speed settings and a 150-minute battery life. Plus, it\'s quiet enough to use while watching Netflix.\n\nGifting jewelry is notoriously tricky since everyone has different tastes. These universally flattering (and adored!) Mejuri Croissant Dôme Hoops have just enough Parisian flair to elevate an office outfit, and are minimalist enough for her to rock any time with loungewear. The hoops are made of long-lasting 18-karat gold vermeil atop sterling silver -- so you get the look and feel of solid gold without the price tag.\n\nCooking solo is no fun -- turn dinner into the family affair it was always intended to be with Solo Stove, the novelty bonfire made of stainless steel we reviewed and fell in love with. Easy to store and super sleek, the Bonfire generates heat with very little smoke. It burns wood so efficiently you\'ll only be left with ultra-fine ash, making cleanup as simple as discarding the ash. (Want something even more special? Solo Stove has its own pizza oven that we\'re obsessed with too.)\n\nEver heard of a Moon Pod? This modern take on a beanbag chair offers a rather amazing, cloudlike zero-gravity sensation when you sink into it.\n\nIf she\'s never not on Instagram, there\'s about a 95% chance she wants an Always Pan just like the rest of us. This do-it-all pan combines the power of eight traditional pieces of cookware into one aesthetically pleasing nonstick pan.\n\nSure, takeout is always on the table, but even more delicious and exciting is homemade pizza. Treat her to the fan-favorite Ooni Pizza Oven that cooks authentic 12-inch wood-fired pizzas (or flatbreads, calzones and naan bread) with golden brown crusts in one minute flat. Without a chimney, it\'s safe and portable enough to take with you on camping trips and picnics, or to leave as the centerpiece of your yard. One-touch gas ignition and adjustable heat controls allow you to customize the baking process for a drool-worthy pie each time.\n\nOne of our all-time favorite body pillows, Yana is a great pregnancy, body and just everyday pillow, largely because it\'s one of the only pillows out there that hugs you back.\n\nFlowers are cool and all, but plants? Mom might just find as much satisfaction watching them grow up as she did you and your siblings. Bloomscape\'s Bamboo Palm features air purifying properties, making it a solid addition to her work-from-home setup. As a low-maintenance plant with minimal light requirements, it has the capacity to reach 8 feet tall.\n\nIt\'s not that Crocs are cool again; they were never *not* cool. Allow Mom to put her comfiest feet forward with the Classic Lined Clog, which boasts a plush and fuzzy liner. As a solid indoor slipper or everyday shoe, the lightweight clogs feature an optional ankle strap for ultimate support, and feature that same breathable foam material that made Crocs so iconic in the first place. Treat her to a Mother\'s Day-friendly hue like lavender and fuchsia fun with an optional Jibbitz charm, and she\'s bound to get into the holiday spirit every time she wears them.\n\nThe only time your super-cool mom slows down is during her bath time ritual. She lights candles; pours in the bubble bath, oil and salts; cracks open a book; and settles in for the next hour (or two). Her only worry, of course, is spilling her wine in the tub. That\'s where this nifty gift comes in handy; it can hold her bevvie of choice, thanks to a superstrong suction function.\n\nWhether she\'s always entertaining or the first one to reach for the cheese board (a woman after our own heart), this personalized bamboo swivel cheeseboard from Uncommon Goods is sure to make her smile (as if she were saying, ""cheese!""). The included stainless steel knives and cheese fork make it a snacking one-stop shop, and it converts into a multilevel wheel for both functional and visual appeal. Top it off with her initials and optional date, and it\'ll be a gift she\'ll be proud to show off for years.\n\nIt\'s simple math: Gourmet cupcakes are the way to Mom\'s heart. Grab the Mother\'s Day Sampler Pack from the ever-legendary Magnolia Bakery, which includes two large classic banana puddings and six assorted cupcakes with flower buttercream. Who knows? She might just offer you a bite.\n\nThe most practical gifts often make the best gifts. Keep her feeling at ease (i.e., with a fully charged phone battery) and gift her this personalized wireless charger from VistaPrint. Its smooth plastic casing features edge-to-edge vibrant printing, which you can use to upload and edit a photo of a tender moment between you and Mom, or one of her glam shots from the \'80s (or, you know, yesterday). The charger is compatible with all Qi-enabled phones and makes for a great way to keep her feeling connected in more ways than one.\n\nCuddling under a blanket is one way to stay cozy, but it keeps you tethered to the couch. This heavyweight recycle fleece hoodie boasts all the same comfort but on the go. It has stretchy rib side panels, secret thumb loops and a built-in pouch in the front pocket.\n\nBaths are the ultimate luxury. Elevate her bath game with this marble bath caddy from Anthropologie that allows her to store anything from candles to books and soap to drinks on its circular embossed cutout. The handcrafted white marble material looks as chic during a bath as it does resting on its edges when not in use.\n\nMake Mom nostalgic for the good ol\' days by allowing her to identify her previous travels (or pine over future trips!) with this pushpin map. You can include a text of your choosing (like your family\'s name) on the map\'s legend, and it operates as both a sophisticated form of decor and a valuable keepsake.\n\nIt\'s no secret many moms consider their furry friends their ""real kids."" Lean into it by customizing a photo of her specific cat or dog breed using Animalist\'s iterations on modern art, from geometric patterns to minimalist linear silhouettes. Choose your preferred size, color, orientation, design and text for a piece of art that\'s bound to take center stage on the mantle.\n\nA good night\'s sleep relies on many factors, chief among them being the quality of her sheets. My Sheets Rock lives up to its brand name with its ridiculously buttery-soft bamboo sheets available in nine pleasant colors from sand to stone and cream. The temperature-regulating and moisture-wicking sheets come in sizes twin XL to split king for a dream-come-true gift she\'ll use virtually every day.\n\nSome like it hot, and others like it truffle-infused. Give her the best of both worlds with this influencer-approved truffle hot sauce from Truff made with premium ingredients like real truffles, ripe red chili peppers and organic agave nectar. The bestseller pack includes its umami-forward Signature Black Truffle Hot Sauce, White Truffle Hot Sauce and Black Truffle Oil for all her garnishing needs. It comes prepackaged in a sleek matte gift box lined with gold foil, so all you need to do is add to cart, gift and watch her eyes and taste buds light up.\n\nThe better quality the knives, the less effort she\'ll need to expend while whipping up her favorite meals, and the less likely she\'ll experience injury attributed to working with dull blades. Treat her to this comprehensive set of chef-worthy knives from Zwilling made of hand-polished carbon stainless steel, which was our runner-up in our best knife set piece. The aesthetically pleasing acacia knife block houses a paring knife, chef\'s knife, fine-edge prep knife and more.\n\nPurists know music sounds best in a record player. Give her the gift of the nostalgic Victrola Empire record player with the advanced performance of a Bluetooth speaker. The 6-in-1 device boasts a trendy midcentury modern appeal, easily converts analog to digital files through its USB ADC integration and includes a headphone jack for solo jam sessions.\n\nPajamas and robes are your standard Mother\'s Day fare. This year, gift her the pure luxury that is silk pajamas from one of our favorite silk brands, Lunya. This set, with a cropped short-sleeve top and long pants, will instantly elevate her house attire.\n\nWhat you love the most about your mom is how she brings sunshine wherever she goes. And now she can carry a flame with her -- literally. This tabletop fireplace can be placed on top of a coffee table or outdoors to set the mood. It\'s fueled by rubbing alcohol and doesn\'t emit smoke or odor but creates the same feel-good ambiance as the real deal. Dependent on the weather and climate, it\'ll stay lit for up to 50 minutes.\n\nNix the old-school picture frame idea and gift her this futuristic Nixplay photo frame that displays all of life\'s most precious moments on repeat. You can gift it to her preset with photos or have her customize her own settings from the time each photo is displayed, the order in which the photos appear, the type of transition from one photo to the next and more. Mom can stay connected with her favorite people by sharing photos and albums straight from her phone or social media accounts with up to five other frames.\n\nNot sure what to get the mom who has everything and *likes* everything? Gift her this luxurious Mother\'s Day gift box with all sorts of customizable options from soap to wine glasses and mugs with an obligatory mom theme. The box includes a miscellany of products she\'ll turn to on the regular, from hand cream to fuzzy socks, eye masks, herbal tea and more.\n\nNo shade to drip coffee, but it\'s not exactly the most efficient way to brew a cup of joe, nor is it the tastiest. What her kitchen needs is the cult-favorite Nespresso machine with an included Aeroccino milk frother for a perfect start to the day. The single-touch brewing system comes with 12 capsules and uses their barcodes to detect the ideal temperature for each cup. With the option of hot or cold foam, she\'ll happily do away with her daily Starbucks habit.\n\nIn addition to being ultra glam, silk pillowcases are also a practical investment; they\'re easier on your hair and skin than their cotton counterparts because they\'re less drying. These silk pillowcases come in six size options and a whopping 36 different colors.\n\nYour cool mom has a remedy for anything and everything, including all of your heartbreaks, office stress and that spot on your chin. Usually, the answer is found in an essential oil blend she whipped up herself. Now, with this porcelain diffuser, she can burn any scent she needs throughout the day. In addition to offering two timer settings -- nonstop for four hours or intermittently for eight -- it\'s also pretty enough to be mistaken as decor.\n\nIf Mom\'s an organizing pro and is looking to live a more eco-conscious lifestyle, these silicone Stasher bags will be a hit. We tried them ourselves and fell in love because essentially they\'re an eco-friendly swap for plastic baggies, and you can even use them to make popcorn!\n\nWeighted blankets are all the rage for their calming effects on the nervous system, and now Mom can take hers wherever she goes. The 10-pound Travel Napper from Bearaby is made of soft knitted organic cotton and comes in a handy duffel bag, making it seamless to pack and carry. It comes in five cool colors like Midnight Blue and Evening Rose, and she\'s sure to keep it close by whether she\'s lounging at home or experiencing a bout of nervous flying.\n\nOur pick for the best workout leggings, the Lululemon Align is prized for its buttery-soft feel, stretchiness and thick waistband that never rolls down.\n\nIt\'s time Mom joined the year 2023 with the ubiquitous Apple Watch SE. The multifunctional fitness tracker allows her to make calls and send messages with an iPhone nearby, and it\'s waterproof up to 50 meters. Complete with international emergency calling, emergency SOS, irregular heart rhythm sensors and fall detection, it\'s a safety measure she\'ll be relieved to have on hand no matter where her adventures take her.\n\nMake her grocery shopping hauls much cooler (and more eco-friendly) with these Baggu reusable bags. She can lug pretty much anything in these roomy, recycled nylon bags, which come in a ton of cute patterns -- from ladybugs to poodles. Plus, they can be packed away into a tiny little drawstring pouch for easy storage.\n\nWhile she might be the most fun person you know, your mom knows resting is just as important as playing. And she values her sleep big time. This super-unique device is a one-stop shop for a peaceful slumber. First, it\'s an alarm clock, but more importantly, it also features a smart light, a sound machine, a natural sunrise alarm and meditations. Basically, she can personalize how she wants to fall asleep and wake up, resulting in the kind of slumber she\'s always dreamed of.\n\nFewer scents evoke the lush floral atmosphere of Mother\'s Day in mid-May quite like Viktor&Rolf\'s Flowerbomb Eau de Parfum presented in a gorgeous gift box. The limited-edition gift set includes a full-size, mini and travel-size spray bottle that all boast delicious notes of orange blossom, vanilla, rose and patchouli. Because scent is known to evoke memory on a deeper level than any other sense, she won\'t be able to help but think of you every time she wears it.\n\nThis feeder will fit in beautifully in any backyard or garden, and it\'s a breeze to make a homemade nectar solution hummingbirds will love with four parts water and one part sugar.\n\nDrop the temperature of mom\'s kitchen appliances with our best tested ice cream maker, which makes the creamiest homemade scoop at a terrific price.\n\nAfter all, the message on this cute and convenient dish is the reason we celebrate Mother\'s Day every year.\n\nThis 13.75-ounce candle smells heavenly (notes of bergamot, lavender, sage and jasmine, among others) while illuminating a pertinent message all moms deserve to hear -- thank you!\n\nThere are plenty of ways to digitize your recipes these days, but sometimes nothing compares to the way it\'s always been done. This charming tin comes in four designs and includes 24 recipe cards and 12 dividers. https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/gifts/unique-mothers-day-gifts-2023?iid=CNNUnderscoredHPcontainer"
"Skims vs. Amazon: We put these 2 bodysuits to the test You can\'t shop for the best shapewear without coming across Skims. Pieces from the Kim Kardashian-founded brand are known to be high-quality and include size-inclusive underwear, bras, cozy loungewear and innovative swimwear with Skims Swim.\n\nThough there\'s a frenzy that comes with each new Skims collection drop and restock, this brand isn\'t the only bodysuit in town. Amazon\'s REORIA Sleeveless Racer Back Bodysuit, which looks incredibly similar to Skims Essential Crew Neck Sleeveless Bodysuit, has garnered a quieter cult-like following.\n\nSince it\'s less than half the price of Skims, I had to test the REORIA Sleeveless Racer Back Bodysuit to see if it is, indeed, a suitable alternative.\n\nSkims vs. Amazon bodysuit at a glance\n\nThis stretchy and buttery soft bodysuit fits true to size and is ultra-thin. We found that it\'s worth the money if you have sensitive skin (there\'s no tag) or plan to wear this basic bodysuit often and make it a staple in your wardrobe.\n\nThe fit might seem off from the photos but it\'s worth a try in person as it does a completely fine job as a comfortable base layer that you can dress up or down -- and also comes in a wide range of 24 color options adding some versatility compared to Skims\' three color options.\n\nQuick comparison\n\n95% nylon, 5% spandex\n\n75% nylon, 25% spandex\n\nXXS/XS, S/M, L/XL, 2X/3X, 4X/5X\n\nXS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL\n\n3 (but one is limited edition)\n\nHand wash cold, air dry only\n\nCrew neck with raw cut neckline, smoothing and moisture-wicking material, thong bodysuit, snap closure at gusset\n\nRacer back, snap closure, high neckline, double lined thong bodysuit\n\nFit\n\nIt\'s one thing for these bodysuits to look similar tucked into a pair of jeans -- but don\'t underestimate the power of a well-fitting bodysuit, which a photo won\'t capture.\n\nAmazon\'s lookalike version has a much longer cut crotch compared to the Skims bodysuit and, personally, I don\'t have extra height in my southern region. However, with this substantial bunch of extra material, it could in theory make for a more comfortable (but potentially less seamless) thong fit for some. For reference, I\'m 5\'3"" and, for me, let\'s just say this bodysuit wasn\'t closely skimming my lower torso, but that\'s up to personal preference.\n\nFor the Skims\' go-round, it was more true to size with a traditional seamless thong fit. It also has some stretch in the material, which I will go into further detail later, but adds to the appeal -- although this is not shapewear it does fit with the slightest touch of smoothing compression. But the Skims Essential Crew Neck Sleeveless Bodysuit has a small neck, so be warned -- and strategic -- if you put makeup on first or risk getting some down the front.\n\nMaterial\n\nAmazon\'s Racer Back bodysuit is 75% nylon and 25% spandex, which is very soft and perfectly fine. It just isn\'t as buttery soft and full of stretch as Skims\' 95% nylon and 5% spandex fabric. That extra 20% nylon definitely makes a difference you can feel -- and melt into.\n\nTo try and help make up for this, Amazon\'s lookalike version is double-lined. It also comes in a wide range of 24 options from neutrals to vibrant hues. The second layer is also to help ensure the chest area isn\'t see-through, since neither Skims\' nor this style has a built-in bra, and this thoughtful detail would be more significant during testing of a lighter color.\n\nSkims\' material not only felt great on my skin but also looked great. The fabric\'s single layer is super thin and smoothes, stretches and compresses without the added slight extra bulk from the second layer. Plus, it was also somewhat more sweat- and wrinkle-resistant. However, the Skims bodysuit only comes in three subdued colors (and one of them is a limited edition).\n\nBut remember that potential makeup hazard I mentioned above? Thanks to Skims\' material, if there are any makeup or deodorant mishaps, they easily wipe away with a quick dap of cold water. Similar accidents are a bit more stubborn to remove with spot cleaning from Amazon\'s version.\n\nDetails and quality\n\nSkims does not have a tag in the back, so it avoids any potential itch for those with sensitive skin as well as seeing the stitching from the back. Although Amazon\'s bodysuit does have a tag (though it didn\'t bother me), it got around the visible stitching thanks to the second double layer.\n\nBut one thing about that ""double lining"" -- only the front is completely double lined, not the back. The back has a second layer but it only goes halfway down and it\'s left open, so your arm can get caught when you go to put it on if you aren\'t on the lookout.\n\nBut overall, these were both very comfortable to wear as sleek fitted base layers.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith anything to do with Skims, there tends to be some excitement. And given just how buttery soft and super thin this bodysuit is, I see why people are obsessed (besides the Kardashian factor). But it\'s equally easy to see how the Halter Neck Bodysuit is coming in hot on Amazon.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to how often you plan on wearing it and what type of color palette you\'re shopping for. If you\'re looking for a neutral staple that you plan on wearing often as a base layer for cardigans and blazers, I would invest in the Skims bodysuit as the next basic wardrobe that you can dress up or down.\n\nBut if you don\'t plan to wear it often or would rather spend the money you could get from one Skims and get two colorful ones from Amazon, I wouldn\'t hesitate to give this viral lookalike version a try. https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/fashion/skims-vs-amazon-bodysuits?iid=CNNUnderscoredHPcontainer"

"Mortgage Refinance Rates on April 12, 2023: Rates Climb Higher     - CNET Both 15-year fixed and 30-year fixed refinances saw their mean rates climb this last week. The average rate on 10-year fixed refinance also moved up.\n\nAmid its ongoing battle to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% hike to its target federal funds rate on March 22. Refinance rates, like mortgage rates, fluctuate on a daily basis and could see further movement in response.\n\n""Going forward, it\'s likely that mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate as the housing market continues to react to the uncertainty that permeates today\'s economy,"" says Jacob Channel, senior economist at loan marketplace LendingTree.\n\nAs the Fed aggressively ratcheted up the federal funds rate in 2022, refinance rates spiked, but we\'re seeing signs that rates may be slowly starting to level out as inflation eases.\n\nFor the first two meetings of 2023, the Fed has adopted a slower pace of increases as it waits to see the cumulative effects of policy changes on inflation.\n\nWhile still high, inflation has been steadily declining each month since its peak in June 2022. Following its March meeting, the Fed signaled that ""some additional policy firming"" may be necessary in order to reach its 2% target for inflation.\n\nLooking at average mortgage rate data for the past year, mortgage rates hit a peak in late 2022 and have been trending down since then. We\'re still a long way from the record-low refinance rates of 2020 and 2021, but borrowers may see rates fall in 2023.\n\n""With the backdrop of easing inflation pressures, we should see more consistent declines in mortgage rates as the year progresses, particularly if the economy and labor market slow noticeably,"" says Greg McBride, CFA and chief financial analyst at Bankrate. (Bankrate, like CNET Money, is owned by Red Ventures.) He expects 30-year fixed mortgage rates to end the year near 5.25%.\n\nRegardless of where rates are headed, homeowners shouldn\'t focus on timing the market, and should instead decide if refinancing makes sense for their financial situation. As long as you can get a lower interest rate than your current rate, refinancing will likely save you money. Do the math to see if it makes sense for your current finances and goals. If you do decide to refinance, make sure you compare rates, fees, and the annual percentage rate -- which shows the total cost of borrowing -- from different lenders to find the best deal.\n\nThe current average interest rate for a 30-year refinance is 6.97%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to one week ago. (A basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.) One reason to refinance to a 30-year fixed loan from a shorter loan term is to lower your monthly payment. If you\'re having difficulties making your monthly payments currently, a 30-year refinance could be a good option for you. However, interest rates for a 30-year refinance will typically be higher than rates for a 10- or 15-year refinance. It\'ll also take you longer to pay off your loan.\n\nThe average 15-year fixed refinance rate right now is 6.19%, an increase of 17 basis points compared to seven days ago. A 15-year fixed refinance will most likely raise your monthly payment compared to a 30-year loan. On the other hand, you\'ll save money on interest, since you\'ll pay off the loan sooner. You\'ll also typically get lower interest rates compared to a 30-year loan. This can help you save even more in the long run.\n\nThe current average interest rate for a 10-year refinance is 6.37%, an increase of 24 basis points over last week. Compared to a 15- or 30-year refinance, a 10-year refinance will usually have a lower interest rate but higher monthly payment. A 10-year refinance can help you pay off your house much quicker and save on interest. But you should confirm that you can afford a higher monthly payment by evaluating your budget and overall financial situation.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, refinance interest rates hit a historic low. But in early 2022, the Fed started hiking interest rates in an effort to curb runaway inflation. While the Fed doesn\'t directly set mortgage rates, the Fed rate hikes led to an increased cost of borrowing among most consumer loan products, including mortgages and refinances. Mortgage rates hit a 20-year high in late 2022.\n\nRecent data shows that overall inflation has been falling slowly but steadily since it peaked in June 2022, but it still remains well above the Fed\'s 2% inflation goal. After raising rates by 25 basis points in March, the Fed has indicated (PDF) it plans to slow -- but not stop -- the pace of its rate hikes throughout 2023. Both of these factors are likely to contribute to a gradual pull-back of mortgage and refinance rates this year, although consumers shouldn\'t expect a sharp drop or a return to pandemic-era lows.\n\nWe track refinance rate trends using information collected by Bankrate. Here\'s a table with the average refinance rates reported by lenders across the country:\n\nRates as of April 12, 2023.\n\nIt\'s important to understand that the rates advertised online often require specific conditions for eligibility. Your interest rate will be influenced by market conditions as well as your specific credit history, financial profile and application.\n\nHaving a high credit score, a low credit utilization ratio and a history of consistent and on-time payments will generally help you get the best interest rates. You can get a good feel for average interest rates online, but make sure to speak with a mortgage professional in order to see the specific rates you qualify for. To get the best refinance rates, you\'ll first want to make your application as strong as possible. The best way to improve your credit ratings is to get your finances in order, use credit responsibly and monitor your credit regularly. Don\'t forget to speak with multiple lenders and shop around.\n\nRefinancing can be a great move if you get a good rate or can pay off your loan sooner -- but consider carefully whether it\'s the right choice for you at the moment.\n\nMost people refinance because the market interest rates are lower than their current rates or because they want to change their loan term. When deciding whether to refinance, be sure to take into account other factors besides market interest rates, including how long you plan to stay in your current home, the length of your loan term and the amount of your monthly payment. And don\'t forget about fees and closing costs, which can add up.\n\nAs interest rates increased throughout 2022, the pool of refinancing applicants contracted. If you bought your house when interest rates were lower than they are today, there may not be a financial benefit in refinancing your mortgage. https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-refinance-rates-on-april-12-2023-rates-tick-higher/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"Commentary: Capital Markets Don't Care What We Think About ESG Dan Romito is a consulting partner at Pickering Energy Partners focusing on quantitative ESG strategy and implementation.\n\nInsurance giant Chubb announced a new mandate in March to incorporate evidence-based plans to reduce methane emissions in underwriting guidelines, demonstrating that ESG does not just impact equity and debt, but insurance as well.\n\nAccording to its news release, Chubb will continue to provide insurance coverage for clients that implement evidence-based plans to manage methane emissions, including at a minimum having in place programs for leak detection and repair and the elimination of non-emergency venting.\n\nRegardless of where you stand on the topic, the fact is that ESG impacts access to capital.\n\nMoving forward, insurance options will diminish if clear and quantifiable emissions-based directives are not implemented. This decision will not remain unique to Chubb; it will certainly expand across other providers quickly. As was the case with equity and debt, recent market precedent implies there exists a higher likelihood of broader adoption as opposed to aggressive pushback.\n\nIt is imperative the absorption and interpretation of this directive are not relegated solely to the idealistic. The regulatory markets are quickly evolving in a manner that will adversely impact the companies that underplay the importance of ESG disclosure. This is most evident with the regulatory mandates in Europe, namely the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).\n\nThe investable universe, including insurance, is quickly separating into three distinct areas defined by explicit ESG-related considerations: Article 6 (funds that do not integrate sustainability into the investment process); Article 8 (promotes certain environmental or social characteristics); and Article 9 (a sustainable investment or a reduction in carbon emissions as its objective). Article eligibility is determined by self-reporting the quantitative ESG-related data points necessary to validate a respective designation. To the earlier point on eligibility, Article 8 funds have been dominating capital flows over the last two years, according to Morningstar and Goldman Sachs reports.\n\nWe anticipate SFDR to act as the baseline for the impending SEC greenwashing rules set to be released before the end of the year.\n\nThe Chubb decree, unfortunately, marks only the start of a variety of future anticipated ESG-related mandates. To be fair, Chubb is most likely updating their approach to risk now that the Inflation Reduction Act formally introduces a methane tax to the market beginning in 2024. Facilities exceeding 25,000 metric tons of CO2 per year will be taxed at $900 per metric ton (mt) of methane in 2024. This tax increases to $1,200/mt and $1,500/mt of CO2 in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nWhether the energy industry likes it or not, ESG data and disclosure are now deeply embedded within the processes that determine eligibility for quality equity, debt and, now, insurance. All private and public companies are now expected to provide some degree of ESG-related material to remain eligible for capital markets participation. Moving forward, the industry's collective focus should emphasize the importance of quantitative non-fundamental trends, as opposed to questioning the overall conceptual utility of ESG.\n\nTo properly prepare for the impending regulatory and market changes and to convey the factual narrative, the industry must become more fluent in sustainability terminology. Incorrect interpretation of data primarily derives from the rating agencies and aggregators, who aggressively push their own variation. Therefore, it is critical all companies acquire a firm grasp of their non-fundamental data.\n\nRegulators have also increasingly placed energy within their crosshairs and enhanced their own sophistication with measurement and disclosure. Preparation and protection must include tracking the same data points regulators often use against energy companies.\n\nTo slow the trajectory of regulatory mandates, companies should play more offense and proactively establish the objective economic realities of the energy sector. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to fail winning the pragmatic middle. Unfortunately, the adverse impact of this decision will have a greater impact on smaller private mid-market energy businesses. Ironically, the empirical fact remains that the U.S.' energy sector is leading the way in decarbonization, safety, efficiency, reliability and affordability. The narrative, however, is currently controlled by the detractor community.\n\nRegardless, the math implies the U.S. has figured out how to decouple energy use and economic growth since U.S. GDP has increased steadily while total energy use has remained flat over the last 25 years. The sector's empirical trend over the last quarter century is impressive; however, the industry continues to struggle in telling the collective story. The positive is that the U.S. is already the world's cleanest and most efficient energy producer.\n\nControversy aside, we must acknowledge that ESG-related directives and data are now embedded within the global regulatory fabric. Assuming financial returns are in place, companies positioning themselves in a manner where accessing trending non-fundamental data becomes second nature will thrive, while companies that do not, regardless of financial performance, will struggle. https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/commentary-capital-markets-dont-care-what-we-think-about-esg-204727"
"A Survey of Resources and Methods for Natural Language Processing of Serbian Language The Serbian language is a Slavic language spoken by over 12 million speakers and well understood by over 15 million people. In the area of natural language processing, it can be considered a low-resourced language. Also, Serbian is considered a high-inflectional language. The combination of many word inflections and low availability of language resources makes natural language processing of Serbian challenging. Nevertheless, over the past three decades, there have been a number of initiatives to develop resources and methods for natural language processing of Serbian, ranging from developing a corpus of free text from books and the internet, annotated corpora for classification and named entity recognition tasks to various methods and models performing these tasks. In this paper, we review the initiatives, resources, methods, and their availability. https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2794974/v1"

"Nvidia enhances mid-range video gaming chip with AI technology (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp said on Wednesday it is packing one of its mid-range chips for gamers with more artificial intelligence features to improve graphics, underscoring the importance of gaming for the company despite the segment\'s slowing revenue.\n\nThe new RTX 4070 chip, which Nvidia will start shipping on Thursday, will cost $599, putting it near the middle of the company\'s range of graphics processing units (GPUs), which list for up to $1,600.\n\nThe chip that it updates, the RTX 3060, is the fourth most popular gaming chip on the market, according to survey data in March from game distribution platform Steam.\n\nWhile Nvidia\'s data center chips for training artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT have powered the company\'s revenue growth in recent years, the company still got about a third of its $26.9 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue from gaming chips, though gaming revenue was down by 27%, dragged down by a sagging overall PC market.\n\nNvidia\'s chips help PC video games render images on to high-resolution screens more quickly to make games look more realistic. The 4070 chips will be the cheapest available that use Nvidia\'s newest AI technology to do so.\n\nRather than calculate precisely what the value of each pixel on a screen should be, which can take extra time, the newest Nvidia gaming chips use artificial intelligence to predict what about seven out of every eight pixels should be, including generating entire frames using AI.\n\nA game ""is not like a movie where everything\'s been pre-recorded.

"Deepfakes, and why we should be worried that every day is becoming April Fool's Day Deepfakes are becoming so common that we may not even realise that some of the images and videos we encounter have been artificially created. We briefly discuss what a deepfake is and some of the ways it has been permeating our lives and the content we consume.\n\nGenerally, April Fool\'s Day is perhaps the only day of the year when we have permission to share practical jokes and hoaxes, in the hope that some of the more gullible among us would believe them, but ultimately, we can all have a good laugh about it and move on. However, what happens when it is not April Fool\'s Day, and hoaxes abound? That is the situation that increasingly is emerging and is of particular concern.\n\nA CNN article published late last week highlighted some of the recent hoaxes that went viral: ""Pope Francis wearing a massive, white puffer coat. Elon Musk walking hand-in-hand with rival GM CEO Mary Barra. Former President Donald Trump being detained by police in dramatic fashion."" The article continued by noting that none of those incidents happened, but they were artificial intelligence (AI)-generated images that are becoming cheaper and easier to create. For example, the image of Pope Francis wearing a puffer coat was reportedly created by a 31-year-old construction worker from Chicago, in the United States, who was tripping on mushrooms (Source: BuzzFeed News).\n\nAs the technology to create such content becomes even more accessible, it is imperative that we also become more aware, ask questions and perhaps be not so quick to believe what we can see.\n\nThe term, ""deepfake"", is a mash-up between ""deep learning"" and ""fake"", and refers to AI-generated media that manipulate or generate visual and audio content, usually with the purpose to deceive others. Deepfake had its beginning in image manipulation, which is decades old, but has improved and evolved as technology has developed.\n\nFor the ordinary consumer, who may have an appreciation of what AI-generated image platforms (such as MidJourney and Lensa AI) can do, deepfake can be considered an extrapolation of that, where convincing but fictional photos and videos can be created from scratch. And in the case of video, the voices of real-life people can be cloned and manipulated to say anything, with the source audio of individuals\' voices being collected from past recordings, and even WhatsApp messages.\n\nSuffice it to say, it is becoming increasingly difficult to spot deepfake content. Not only is the technology improving, but many of the subtle signs of fakes, such as eyes that do not blink, patchy skin tones, bad lip-synching and inconsistent lighting, have been addressed to varying degrees, and so on first glance – or even several glances – you might not readily be able to distinguish between real and fake content.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that deepfakes have already begun to permeate the media we consume. For example,\n\nFurther, thousands of deepfake videos are being created for the porn industry, and concern is growing that ""[d]eepfake technology is being weaponised against women"" (Source: The Guardian). For example, the no longer available DeepNude app used ""…neural networks to remove clothing from the images of women, making them look realistically nude"" (Source: Vice). In a time of growing revenge porn and cyberbullying, the power of deepfake to harass, demean and undermine others is indeed worrying.\n\nWe must also highlight the power and influence of traditional media and media platforms that may unwittingly perpetuate and give legitimacy to deepfakes in the rush to be the first to release breaking news. Noting that it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate real and fake images and video, we as consumers may end up not only believing but also acting upon, information that may later be revealed as false and thereafter, may need to deal with the consequences.\n\nFinally, although there is a definite need for concern about deepfakes, work is underway to give us, the users, information about the source of the content we are seeing, in order for us to decide whether what we are encountering is authentic or artificially created. Two of the companies leading the way are Microsoft and Adobe, who have joined forces to provide details on the history of a photograph or image, such as who took it, when and where it was taken, and the edits that were subsequently made (Source: CBS News).\n\nThis content credentials feature has been gaining wide support, and may become the norm in the not-too-distant future. Nevertheless, we, users and consumers, need to become more vigilant and educated about ongoing threats, and recognise that we may longer be able to take all that we see at face value. Increasingly, we will need to ask ourselves, ""Is this real?"", and do a bit of sleuthing to come to an answer.\n\nImage credit: ApolitikNow (flickr) https://www.ict-pulse.com/2023/04/deepfakes-and-why-we-should-be-worried-that-every-day-is-becoming-april-fools-day/"

"Are You A Good Candidate for Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids? Here's What to Know     - CNET Hearing aids are now available over the counter, which means you don\'t need a prescription to get one and you don\'t necessarily have to go to the doctor first.\n\nThe OTC hearing devices will save people a lot of money, and hopefully get those who need a device will get access to hearing aids faster than before.\n\nMany people are good candidates for OTC hearing aids, but some will need to see a doctor or audiologist before being fitted for one.\n\nSome notice their hearing problems years before getting seen and fit for a hearing aid. But now, hearing aids for many people might\'ve just gotten a lot easier to find.\n\nHearing aids for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss are now available over the counter, thanks to a rule from the US Food and Drug Administration. While there are still some uncertainties in the hearing health industry about how this will roll out, many have been waiting for over-the-counter options because they remove the prescription barrier, which requires a doctor\'s or audiologist visit -- and more money. (The average price of a pair of OTC hearing aids is estimated to be around $600 to $1,200 for a pair, which could save you as much as a few thousand dollars, depending on which device you choose and other factors.)\n\nThis means you\'re now able to buy a hearing aid at Best Buy, Walgreens, Walmart and other stores and pharmacies throughout the US, making getting your hands on a hearing aid almost as easy as tossing a pair of drug-store reading glasses into your cart. (Note: there\'s a difference between an OTC hearing aid and sound amplification products, which have been available at stores and aren\'t regulated for hearing loss like hearing aids are.) And while there is more nuance and user involvement in finding and fitting the correct hearing aid, proponents of the new FDA rule hope that the accessibility will help people who\'ve had hearing problems get the tools they need. According to the American Academy of Audiology, people usually wait seven to 10 years after first experiencing symptoms of hearing loss before seeking help. Hearing -- one of our most fundamental forms of communicating -- can cause physical and mental health problems when it diminishes without treatment, including loneliness, reduced alertness, cognitive decline and more.\n\nRead more: What to Know Before Purchasing Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids\n\nBut with this new table of products come some questions: Who actually needs a hearing aid, and who should buy one over the counter vs. getting a prescription? How can you tell if you have ""mild to moderate"" hearing loss, anyway?\n\nWe talked to a couple of experts to narrow down whether you should consider shopping for an OTC hearing aid.\n\nSony\'s new over-the-counter hearing aid, the CRE-C10. The new over-the-counter market could encourage more competitiveness between electronic device companies -- and maybe result in cooler devices for us.\n\nDr. Frank Lin is the director of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Lin said that about 90% of people with hearing loss could be served by an over-the-counter hearing aid.\n\n""One flippant way of answering your question is if you think you have hearing loss, you will likely be served by OTC hearing aids in terms of their technical capabilities,"" Lin said. He added that if you\'re someone who has severe hearing loss and will need a more intensive hearing aid, it ""won\'t be subtle."" In addition to people with severe hearing loss, OTC aids for children and teens under 18 still require a prescription.\n\nLin says there\'s such a lack of consumer education around hearing health right now, that it\'s presented as so complicated you need to go talk to your doctor before figuring anything out.\n\n""Which I find offensive as a consumer, but as a clinician I can see why people say that,"" Lin added. ""But it doesn\'t make sense.""\n\nBarbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America, says it\'s important to remember that the fact that hearing aids will now be easier to get doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t or can\'t get an official hearing test, it just means that you don\'t have to wait for one.\n\n""Of course, this doesn\'t preclude somebody from getting a hearing screening or an audiological evaluation, but you don\'t have to,"" Kelley said.\n\nThat is, it\'s probably still a good idea for you to see a doctor or audiologist to make sure that you have the correct fit and that there\'s not another health condition at play interfering with your hearing. But now you\'re able to get a head start on hearing again instead of waiting on appointment times, more money or other barriers that can interfere with health care.\n\nOne subtle, but fast, way to know whether you might need an OTC hearing aid is if you\'re just starting to notice some changes in your ability to hear, Tricia Ashby-Scabis, senior director of audiology practices at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, told CNET. Maybe you think people are mumbling more often, or people with higher-pitched voices, like women and children, are harder to hear.\n\nTo help people decide if they have mild or moderate hearing loss, the American Academy of Audiology lays out three criteria:\n\nOf course, the most accurate way to know whether you have hearing loss, and to what degree, is by going to see an audiologist or a doctor for an official hearing test. The American Academy of Audiology recommends you get screened before trying an OTC device, and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association says that the ""best way"" to know whether you\'re a good candidate for a hearing aid is to be examined by an audiologist, because it\'s easy to underestimate your level of hearing loss.\n\nIn an effort to bring audiologist-level tests to you, companies like Soundly are expanding into the telehealth space. Soundly, a hearing-aid comparison website founded by Blake Cadwell after his own experience trying to find a hearing aid, just announced its partnership with Tuned, merging Tuned\'s network of audiologists with Soundly\'s users. An hour-long Tuned consultation with an audiologist is $150, and Soundly users get a 10% discount. (Soundly also offers a quick, free hearing screening on its website.)\n\nIn another initiative to quantify hearing loss, Lin and his team have created Johns Hopkins\' Hearing Number, which pairs with either the Mimi or SonicCloud app for a hearing test, which inputs your score into Apple\'s Health App and tells you on the Hearing Number website whether you might have mild or moderate hearing loss. (This is only available for iPhone users at this time.) This metric for gauging hearing ability mirrors other health metrics we\'ve gotten comfortable with, like measuring our blood glucose and counting our steps. The goal, Lin says, is to ""push out a consumer-facing metric.""\n\nConsumer electronic companies like Bose and Sony have announced partnerships with hearing health companies in order to navigate this new market. While there are differences among the over-the-counter devices, they are all ""self-fit"" and require you to set up your hearing aid yourself after you buy it. In the case of Sony\'s hearing aid, as well as of Lexie Hearing\'s and Bose\'s, you\'ll be guided by a paired app for things like ear measurements (to make sure the device fits and you don\'t need a different piece) or self-tuning.\n\nCatherine Palmer, past president of the American Academy of Audiology and director of the audiology program at the University of Pittsburgh, said in an email that a good candidate for an OTC hearing aid ""would be someone who is able to and enjoys self-managing care, meaning that they will need to take time to figure out the fit of the device.""\n\nWhile the guided apps will likely offer some help, this type of hands-on care may not be enjoyable or even tolerable for everyone. If you\'d like to minimize your involvement in this process, you might still choose to get fitted with an audiologist even if you\'re otherwise a good candidate for OTC hearing aids -- they can help you select one that best suits your needs.\n\nRead more: New Bose-Lexie Hearing Aid to Enter Over-the-Counter Market\n\nPeople who are experiencing hearing loss but also have physical symptoms or pain should think twice before buying a device without first seeing a doctor, according to ASHA. Symptoms to look out for -- and signs you should not get an OTC device right now -- are:\n\nAside from physical symptoms, people with ""complex"" listening needs should be evaluated because they might need more individualized care, Palmer says. This includes people who have trouble hearing when there are other mental or environmental factors at play, like anxiety or being in a busy or noisy environment. This could possibly indicate another health or cognitive issue other than hearing loss that should be addressed. https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/are-you-a-good-candidate-for-otc-hearing-aids/#ftag=CAD590a51e"

The next minute, he\'s personally involved in stamping out the slightest dissent,"" Graham said at the time. ""So I think he\'s unhinged. He\'s 33 years old – if this is the next 50 years, God help us all.""\n\nHe added, ""It\'s an important relationship, but the values that we possess as Americans are more important than any single relationship… I just don\'t believe that we can ever do business with Saudi Arabia again, as long as he\'s in charge.""\n\nGraham also called for sanctions against Saudi Arabia a month later over Khashoggi\'s death, though he pointed out they had been a ""strategic ally.""\n\nBIDEN DEFENDS SAUDI ARABIA TRIP AS BID TO \'STRENGTHEN A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP\' IN WAPO OP-ED\n\n""I firmly believe there will be strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the royal family, for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms. While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the crown prince – in multiple ways – has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic,"" the senator said at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGraham\'s Wednesday evening statement did not mention Khashoggi\'s death.\n\nBut his visit comes at a critical time for Middle Eastern relations – just last week, Saudi officials met with their Iranian counterparts in China for their first formal gathering in more than seven years. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/graham-praises-saudi-arabias-crown-prince-calling-unhinged-2018"

"ChatGPT is better at predicting how stocks will react to news headlines than traditional models, new study shows ChatGPT can\'t see the future, but it already has value for investors looking to predict future moves in the stock market.\n\nThat\'s according to a new research paper published Monday in the Social Science Research Network by two University of Florida finance professors.\n\nThe researchers fed the chatbot over 50,000 news headlines about companies that date back to October of 2021 and asked it to determine whether the headlines were good, bad, or irrelevant news for the companies\' stock prices. They used this sentiment analysis to compute a numerical ""ChatGPT score"" and analyzed whether these scores were predictive of the company\'s stock market performance the next day.\n\nThe researchers found a statistically significant positive correlation between these scores and the next-day stock performance for the companies they analyzed. Firms with higher scores tended to see better returns than those with lower scores.\n\nThe study also found that ChatGPT outperformed other ""traditional sentiment analysis methods"" that also use data from headlines and social media to forecast stock movements -- although the researchers admit they did not test every single one of these methods in this study.\n\n""In short, our study demonstrates the value of ChatGPT in predicting stock market returns,"" the researchers wrote.\n\nThey added: ""Our results suggest that incorporating advanced language models into the investment decision-making process can yield more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of quantitative trading strategies.""\n\nWhen the researchers compared the performance of ChatGPT with traditional methods, they found that those other models didn\'t add any predictive power over their ChatGPT-derived sentiment scores.\n\n""Once you use ChatGPT, using the other sentiment measure is not helpful for predicting,"" Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a co-author of the paper, told Insider.\n\nLopez-Lira said that in the future, AI tools like ChatGPT could be used to improve the stock market\'s efficiency by incorporating news faster into stock prices. He also said these tools could replace some investment analysts.\n\nEver since ChatGPT was rolled out last November, users have tested its limits. They\'ve asked it what stocks to invest in, used it to earn money through side hustles, and even asked it to help start a business. As much as the chatbot has amazed, many of its limitations have surfaced as well.\n\nLopez-Lira said that investors should ""exercise caution and not rely solely on ChatGPT or similar AI models,"" in part because there are several areas where the AI needs to improve when it comes to stock market prediction.\n\nFirst, ChatGPT isn\'t ""connected to the internet"" and therefore can\'t access the latest information available.\n\n""ChatGPT does not have access to any recent data beyond its training cutoff in September 2021,"" he said. ""This limitation means that the AI model may not know more recent market trends, news, or developments that could significantly impact stock prices and investment decisions.""\n\nChatGPT also currently struggles at processing large texts and ""number crunching.""\n\n""It cannot process large amounts of numerical data, such as firms\' accounting data,"" he said.\n\nAddressing these concerns, Lopez-Lira said, could ""vastly increase the prediction capabilities"" of the chatbot.\n\n""As the field of AI-driven finance continues to expand, the insights gleaned from this research can help guide the development of more accurate, efficient, and responsible models that enhance the performance of financial decision-making processes,"" the researchers wrote in the paper\'s concluding line. https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-stock-predictions-news-headline-sentiment-analysis-market-moves-study-2023-4"
"Creating Positive Social Impact Through Company Values: Unique Considerations For Nigeria Sheffy Kolade, CEO, Boxes and Baskets LLC, Nigeria and USA. Social Impact Entrepreneur.\n\nIncorporating social impact into a company\'s strategy and growth plan has become increasingly important in recent years. Social impact as a part of a company\'s values can not only help benefit society but also help achieve financial objectives.\n\nBy aligning social impact with your company\'s values and strategy, you can create a long-term positive effect and increase customer loyalty and trust. For instance, in my home country, Nigeria, there are many underrepresented individuals who possess skills that could be harnessed to create value for society if given the right opportunities.\n\nAccording to sources like the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, over 40% of the country\'s population lives below the poverty line. This means that a significant number of Nigerians are unable to access basic necessities such as food, water and shelter.\n\nProviding these individuals with access to job opportunities can help to lift them out of poverty and improve their quality of life. I believe businesses not only have a responsibility to help those willing to work, but it can also make financial sense.\n\nWhen it comes to Nigeria versus other markets, there are several unique considerations to keep in mind. For example, Nigeria faces significant challenges in areas such as education, healthcare and poverty reduction. Therefore, businesses that prioritize social impact in these areas may have a greater impact on local communities.\n\nAdditionally, businesses operating in Nigeria or working in some capacity there may face specific regulatory and cultural challenges that require a nuanced approach to social impact initiatives. It is important for businesses to work closely with local partners and stakeholders to understand these challenges and develop effective solutions.\n\nI have witnessed how many talented artisans in Nigeria have had to resort to menial jobs and even crime due to an inability to gain access to markets for the products they are able to offer. Nigeria is home to a large number of artisans who are skilled in various crafts such as carpentry, tailoring and welding.\n\nUnfortunately, these artisans are often unable to access the markets they need to sell their products or services. This leaves them with few options, leading to frustration and sometimes crime.\n\nThis is a specific example of how taking people off the streets and providing them with opportunities to showcase their skills can have a significant impact on society. It not only helps to reduce crime rates but also contributes to economic growth by creating jobs and generating revenue.\n\nWhen companies incorporate social impact into their values, strategy and growth plans, they can help to create these opportunities for underrepresented individuals in society. Governments and institutions can also play a crucial role in nudging companies toward incorporating social impact.\n\nWhen governments provide incentives for companies to prioritize social impact in their operations, it has been shown to be highly effective in making sure these companies ""actively fulfill their social responsibilities"" with product market competition playing ""an intermediary role.""\n\nThus, we can look to governments that have been most efficient at turning incentives into jobs created and maintained. Some examples of these government programs already in place include:\n\n1. The Impact Investment Fund in Australia. This program provides support through loans, equity investments and other financial products to eligible organizations. Its focus is on job creation and economic growth in underserved communities.\n\n2. The Social Enterprise Investment Fund (SEIF) in the U.K. Similarly, this program offers grants, loans and equity investments to eligible organizations, with a focus on job creation and economic growth.\n\n3. The Social Innovation Fund (SIF) in the U.S. The SIF is a public-private partnership that invests in nonprofit organizations and social enterprises that have a track record of success and a plan for scaling their impact.\n\nInstitutions like these not only provide funding to companies but also provide mentorship and guidance on how to incorporate social impact into a company\'s values, strategy and growth plans.\n\nBut while I see these types of larger government programs as essential, private sector contribution to social impact is also key. There are several ways for businesses to get into social impact practices. Here are some key steps:\n\n1. Define your social impact goals. Before embarking on any social impact initiative, you should define your goals and objectives. This will help you stay focused and measure your progress over time.\n\n2. Collaborate with stakeholders. Social impact initiatives often require collaboration with other stakeholders, such as government agencies, NGOs or local communities. Find ways to build strong partnerships in order to help your business achieve its goals more effectively.\n\n3. Market and advertise your social impact practices. To effectively market and advertise your social impact practices, you should be transparent and authentic about your efforts. This can include creating a dedicated section on your website, sharing success stories on social media and participating in relevant events and conferences.\n\nI believe more companies should look into how they can incorporate social practices as it presents a unique opportunity for long-term customer loyalty and trust. By providing job opportunities for underrepresented individuals in countries like Nigeria, businesses can not only create value for society but also foster economic growth and development.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

"Understanding AI's Limitations Can Help Bring It Into The Life Sciences Sue is the SVP of Product Management where she helps infuse MasterControl solutions with machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is making a lot of headlines right now. Tools like ChatGPT and visual art generators are shocking audiences with their creativity, lucidity and function. Investment in everyday business-focused AI and machine learning is accelerating exponentially, with more sophisticated options appearing in the market.\n\nAI is poised to shift the way companies operate in many industries. As a product executive for a life sciences company, I\'m often asked when AI will revolutionize our industry. The answer: Realizing the wider benefits from AI for quality and manufacturing professionals may be out of reach until critical changes are implemented.\n\nAI can be a transformative and valuable tool for healthcare companies today--most, however, aren\'t ready to adopt helpful solutions. For one thing, functional AI requires large quantities of digitized data, and many life science practitioners are still storing data in paper notebooks, logbooks and binders. There\'s much that would need to change before companies of all sizes could benefit from AI.\n\nThe following are key first steps before AI can be effective without putting companies and consumers at risk.\n\nDigital maturity is the foundation of life science quality and manufacturing benefitting from AI. This can be a big step for smaller companies that still utilize paper records in daily work.\n\nAI will provide the most accurate findings, predictions and recommendations only when it has access to wider, more complete data about your manufacturing and quality processes. For example, an AI model designed to understand which portions of your manufacturing process are contributing to product defects can only consider the data within its view.\n\nFor a comprehensive view of variables, you\'ll need to ensure the model has access to data about your suppliers, materials, equipment, quality processes and each step of your manufacturing process. When stripped of the ability to consider the right data factors, an AI model will draw false correlations and incorrect conclusions.\n\nConnecting your data from across systems within your company will help ensure that you (and your AI) have an accurate and comprehensive view. Utilizing master data management will help ensure that data is uniform, consistent, understandable and appropriately modeled, providing the right information for your analytics and AI initiatives.\n\nFor example, if the materials used in your product manufacturing have different names in each software system, the AI won\'t understand that each ID represents the same material. This prevents the model from having a complete understanding of the role that material plays in your overall process.\n\nOvercoming the sizable challenge of digitizing and connecting data right now may be enough to disqualify many life science companies from achieving value from AI.\n\nWhen life science companies are thinking about adopting AI, one of the most important considerations in the implementation is that the margins of error in production are minuscule. Any mistakes don\'t just lead to a product recall or downturn in business--they could be life-threatening.\n\nDeveloping a clear understanding of your company\'s challenges and where AI can help is an important early step toward implementation. In many industries, it can work to adopt a technology tool first and then identify problems and use cases appropriate for the solution.\n\nHowever, the inherent risks and challenges in manufacturing for life science companies make that approach unwise. For AI to provide benefits, we must identify areas with a high volume of relevant data and a reasonable margin for error.\n\nFor example, AI can evaluate data resulting from your manufacturing process, proactively monitoring and detecting production runs and environments in which the risk of potential defects is higher than the norm. Then, it can make recommendations for further investigation and testing.\n\nHuman oversight and intervention can initially validate findings and ensure that the model is performing well and becoming more accurate over time. In this way, AI can be used to minimize risk on the manufacturing floor in a safe and controlled way.\n\nIt\'s also important when utilizing AI in life sciences to ensure that models are explainable, with mechanisms for clearly demonstrating its conclusions. And in the highly regulated world of life science manufacturing, it\'s also critical to ensure that models are utilizing data in compliance with industry regulations. By first identifying areas in which AI can provide real value without heightening risk, companies can get the most out of technology investments while maintaining high safety standards.\n\nAI is an advanced technology, but it still has limited understanding--it only ""knows"" the information to which you\'ve given it access. This means an AI model oriented to making recommendations will do so even without sufficient data--that\'s how it\'s been programmed. To avoid false findings and conclusions, you must ensure that the data consumed by your AI models is complete and offers a holistic view of the problem.\n\nWhen given access to the appropriate data, AI can help recognize patterns in manufacturing, supplier and quality data that aren\'t detectable to the human eye. For example, a human might notice that more defects come out of a batch when an oven is set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit rather than 360 degrees. However, an AI model might be able to recommend that 363 degrees is the optimal temperature for the lowest number of defects. Or, when a substitute material from a specific supplier is used, the temperature actually ought to be 366 degrees.\n\nAI opens a world of potential benefits for life science companies. To make the leap, most life science companies will have foundational steps to take before their efforts can bear fruit. Companies that are serious about attaining these benefits must determine what they hope to achieve with AI, ensure that the relevant data exists in their digital ecosystem and then take initial, cautious steps with an eye toward minimizing risk.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Kennedy, Jr. awarded UnTours with the Most Generous Company in America award.\n\nBut what is an UnTour?\n\n""UnTours are for more independent-minded travelers who like to explore and experience the true essence of a place but appreciate not having to sift through lodging options or figure out transportation,"" said Richard G. Edwards, Chief Marketing Officer for UnTours and the Untours Foundation. ""You stay in one villa, apartment, or chalet in one of your dream locations for a week, two weeks, or longer. Each trip includes the most appropriate transportation for the week, whether a rail pass in Switzerland or a rental car in Tuscany. We also provide orientation and support from our UnGuides.""\n\nAn ""UnGuide"" is a local person ready to help you out. If you travel with Untours, you are an ""UnTourist."" The UnGuides can answer questions, provide logistical guidance, and give recommendations on restaurants, tours, and sightseeing. But they don\'t lead you around, and their role is closer to that of a concierge.\n\nOn the lake of Thun in Switzerland with UnTours\n\nUnTours can also lay claim as one of the earliest companies to promote the ""slow travel"" movement and was a pioneer in the industry. By making a version of slow travel accessible to a broad audience, they\'ve become a leading voice in helping travelers understand the value of taking more time in each place. As Edwards noted, ""By doing so, you\'re lowering your environmental impact with fewer flights, preserving tradition and culture by incentivizing communities to stay true to themselves.""\n\nHow does it work? Say you want to spend time in The Netherlands. Every other company will point you to Amsterdam. UnTours, on the hand, will likely book you into one of their properties in the small city of Leiden.\n\n""UnTours originated and thrived in the towns that exemplify local culture,"" said Edwards. ""When you\'re in one small village for a week or two, you feel the rhythm of local life, have the coffee shop owner learn your name, and see things that tourists on a quick stopover wouldn\'t discover. We choose places with easy access to bigger cities and towns, have interesting things to do, and also help you get a true sense of place. We also have UnTours in big cities - Rome, Paris, London, and Barcelona - where things to do and see are everywhere. Even there, we strive to help you dig into local culture and slow your pace.""\n\nSwiss UnGuide Urs Hofer and UnTours CMO Richard Edwards in Thun, Switzerland\n\nUnTours are measured in weeks instead of days. It\'s common to see UnTourists go to Europe for two weeks and stay somewhere in Switzerland for a week and then somewhere in Italy the other week.\n\nAs for the mission of UnTours, this is a business that funnels profits to the UnTours Foundation to work towards alleviating poverty.\n\n""The UnTours Foundation helps promising entrepreneurs who are trying to make the world a better place with their businesses, yet don\'t have access to the financial help they need to grow,"" said Edwards. ""We\'ve helped Equal Exchange in the coffee and food industry, the sporting goods company Senda, and more recently, the Reset Tourism Fund. We\'re trying to even the business playing field for women and under-represented people by providing low-interest loans and the occasional investment in businesses that need that nudge to succeed.""\n\nGo to UnTours for more information. https://www.forbes.com/sites/everettpotter/2023/04/12/why-you-should-consider-untours/"
"What A Retail Showroom Can Do For Rising Brands Rendering of Babylist\'s showroom in Los Angeles opening this summer.\n\nThe term ""showroom"" in retail is a loosely defined alternative to a store. However, at its core is the idea of a physical space showcasing a product rather than acting primarily as a transaction point. Arguably, this is a trend for overall retail, but few brands have honed in on the sole purpose of display.\n\nSome showrooms taking the industry by storm are Showfields, which defines itself as a ""lifestyle discovery store."" It assigns pockets of the store to brands that then custom-build and design shop-in-shops. Similarly is Neighborhood Goods, an Austin-based new type of department store. However, these models differ from wholesale because they don\'t purchase the inventory.\n\nScent Lab\'s display in NYC\'s Neighborhood Goods.\n\nScent Lab, an NYC-based candle company known for its personalized scent profiles, recently launched in Chelsea Market\'s Neighborhood Goods. ""We\'ve done several real-life activations since launching, which have been such a hit! Customers love the experiential component of our business and experience it in person. We have always been bullish on launching into retail, so Neighborhood Goods is a great starting point to test and learn,"" Ariana Silvestro, Founder and CEO of Scent Lab, shared. The brand uses this showroom experience to gain insights into how customers interact with the product in person before launching more extensive wholesale partnerships.\n\nBeyond a showroom\'s advantage as a testing platform is its economic advantage as a cheaper and more flexible way to bring products to customers in real life. And this includes shop-in-shops, where the store itself may operate as a standalone retailer, but brands can rent space to showcase their products. It\'s shared with growing direct-to-consumer brands, like Our Place, which has a shop-in-shop in Nordstrom in NYC, and even e-commerce marketplaces like Petco, which recently announced a shop-in-shop concept across Canada\'s Canadian Tire.\n\nP.F. Candle Co. display in East Fork Pottery in Asheville.\n\nSometimes this also takes place in smaller, more boutique retail stores. For instance, PF Candle Co., which has an online presence and two stores, has recently shifted its strategy to shop-in-shops. ""We wanted to get together with fellow small businesses and like-minded brands that might have also been hit hard by the economic conditions of the past year. Not only has inflation impacted us and many of our peers, but we\'ve also seen a spending shift to experiences over just plain goods,"" stated Kristen Pumphrey, Founder and Creative Director of PF Candle Co.\n\nIn November, the company popped up in East Fork Potter in Asheville. It saw a 70% increase in revenue during that week and a 111% increase in foot traffic. However, it usually sees a traffic lift between 20-40% outside the holiday season. Overall, a notable impact on the business.\n\nUndoubtedly, these showrooms benefit the brands, but what\'s the advantage of creating a showroom in the first place?\n\nBabylist, an online marketplace, and registry for everything baby related, recently announced plans to open its first permanent showroom based in Los Angeles. Last year the company tested the concept with two pop-ups – one in LA and one in NYC. ""We wanted to test a concept that served the user\'s need in a very different way than big box retailers. So we decided to rent these big, beautiful houses and put all the products there. People loved that. They were like ok, this is where the bottle warmer will go on the kitchen counter; this is what it looks like to have a bunch of bottles in the cupboard. So it was this interactive experience and was much more helpful than seeing a highchair in an aisle or on a shelf 10 feet up,"" Lee Anne Grant, Chief Growth Officer of Babylist, shared.\n\nInterior of Babylist\'s NYC pop-up showroom\n\nAnother unique feature was their stroller track with various terrains and weighted babies, so customers (even those still pregnant) could feel what it was like to use the strollers. In addition, throughout the showroom were various QR codes, which guests could scan to learn more about products and add them to their registry. The new permanent store will have the same features as the pop-ups but be more prominent at 14,000 square feet.\n\nThe company generated $290 million in revenue in 2022, a 20% growth from the year prior. In addition, it\'s the number one site for childcare in the US, and this new showroom allows brands on its site to showcase products in person while Bablylist grows its online customer base.\n\nThe showroom is a marketing platform for brands and e-commerce marketplaces. And, in today\'s world with rising digital advertising costs, physical store marketing is a great and cost-effective alternative, especially when it doesn\'t come at the expense of high capital or reduced margins. Therefore, more and more brands and marketplaces will likely turn to showrooms for their marketing needs. https://www.forbes.com/sites/brinsnelling/2023/04/12/what-a-retail-showroom-can-do-for-rising-brands/"
"Mortgage rates drop to a 2-month low as the US job market shows signs of slowing Mortgage rates dropped to a two-month low as the labor market in the world\'s largest economy showed signs of a slowdown, prompting a surge in weekly applications for home loans.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.30% in the week that ended April 7 from 6.40% in the prior week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.\n\nThat marked the fifth consecutive weekly fall in the lending rate for the country\'s most popular type of mortgage and stretched a trend of rates staying below 7% since November. The 30-year rate last year topped 7% for the first time since 2002.\n\n""Incoming data last week showed that the job market is beginning to slow, which led to the 30-year fixed rate decreasing to 6.30%,"" Mike Fratantoni, the MBA\'s chief economist, said in the group\'s update.\n\nThe March payroll report released last week showed the addition of 236,000 jobs, fewer than an expected reading of 239,000. March\'s additions were also below February\'s upwardly revised increase. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% from 3.6%.\n\n""Prospective homebuyers this year have been quite sensitive to any drop in mortgage rates, and that played out last week with purchase applications increasing by 8%,"" Fratantoni said.\n\nThe five-week decline in mortgage rates comes alongside a burst of anxiety in markets after last month\'s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank sparked a jump in deposits flowing out of small to mid-sized banks.\n\nBond yields have generally drifted lower as investors pushed into the Treasury market, seeking safety from the fallout from the first US bank failures since the global financial crisis.\n\nBut the immediate reaction in the bond market after Friday\'s jobs report was a climb in yields as investors appeared to see the labor market as still robust enough to keep the Federal Reserve in rate-hiking mode.\n\nThe recent drop in mortgage rates will likely bolster home sales by more than 200,000, Forbes reported this week, citing Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.\n\nMortgage rates are still well above where they were a year ago, at around 4.9%, keeping the option of purchasing a home out of reach for many people.\n\nIn a separate report, the MBA found that the housing environment is so unaffordable that some banks have lost money for each mortgage they financed last year, the first time on record. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mortgage-rates-30-year-fixed-loan-applications-housing-market-jobs-2023-4"

"NPR stops using Twitter after receiving 'government funded media' label NPR on Wednesday said that it is suspending its use of Twitter after clashing with the social media company over a controversial new ""state-affiliated media"" label applied to its accounts.\n\n""NPR\'s organizational accounts will no longer be active on Twitter because the platform is taking actions that undermine our credibility by falsely implying that we are not editorially independent,"" the broadcaster said in a statement. ""We are not putting our journalism on platforms that have demonstrated an interest in undermining our credibility and the public\'s understanding of our editorial independence.""\n\nLate last week, Twitter labeled the radio broadcaster as a ""state-affiliated media"" organization akin to foreign propaganda outlets such as Russia\'s RT and Sputnik. The move was quickly rebuked by NPR, which is publicly funded by listeners. NPR CEO John Lansing called the label ""unacceptable."" Twitter over the weekend updated the label to ""government-funded media.""\n\nIn a final series of tweets -- its first in over a week -- NPR noted other places its work can be found, including through its app and newsletters, as well as on other social media platforms.\n\nThe move threatens to undermine one of Twitter\'s key selling points -- its role as a central hub for news -- especially if other outlets follow in NPR\'s footsteps. Twitter has also faced backlash over applying a similar ""government funded media"" label to the BBC, which is also primarily funded by the public.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC Tuesday, Twitter owner Elon Musk acknowledged the pushback, saying, ""I know the BBC … was not thrilled about being labeled \'state affiliated media.\'""\n\n""Our goal is simply to … be as truthful and accurate as possible,"" Musk said, adding that he planned to update the BBC\'s label to ""publicly funded.""\n\nIt\'s just the latest example of Musk antagonizing media outlets. Twitter earlier this month also targeted the New York Times by removing the blue verification checkmark from its main account, after previously pledging to remove checks from all users verified under Twitter\'s legacy system. And the platform riled some journalists when it briefly restricted users from sharing links to a popular newsletter platform, a move it quickly walked back.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter also appears to have removed some restrictions on Russian government accounts that had been put in place following the outset of Russia\'s war in Ukraine. ""All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves,"" Musk said in a tweet commenting on the decision Sunday.\n\nThe chaos comes as Musk attempts to shore up Twitter\'s business, which he has repeatedly said was on the brink of bankruptcy and had just ""four months to live"" following his takeover.\n\nTwitter has faced an exodus of advertisers, who have been concerned about increased hate speech on the platform and massive cuts to the company\'s workforce. In the meantime, Musk has taken on the uphill battle of encouraging users to pay $8 per month for the platform\'s subscription service.\n\nIt\'s ""not fun at all"" and can sometimes be ""painful,"" the billionaire CEO told the BBC Tuesday of running the company, although he suggested that some Twitter advertisers are returning to the platform. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/npr-twitter-use/index.html"

"How To Write And Design Your Resume To Impress 3 Key People In The Hiring Process Job seekers should tailor their resume for 3 key stakeholders they meet during the hiring process.\n\nOften when people are applying for jobs, they wrongly assume only the hiring manager cares about their resume and job experience, but in fact there are multiple people you are engaging with during the hiring process.\n\nThe various people involved in hiring for a position are looking at different parts of your resume and overall job experience so it\'s important to be prepared to speak directly to what it is that each person is looking for to excel at the job interview.\n\nTo help you get inside the head of these users of your resume, here are three key stakeholders you\'ll meet along the interview process.\n\nPerson #1 Human Resources Manager or the Recruiter\n\nThe first person is the human resources manager or the recruiter. After you apply for a job, someone in the HR department or a recruiter will decide if you should move along to the next step, which is normally a screening call.\n\nAt this point, they could easily be dealing with hundreds of applicants and more if they\'re hiring for multiple roles. This is why they can\'t read every word on your resume or your LinkedIn profile and only have a few seconds to skim and scan your resume.\n\nThough they\'ll be familiar with what you do and key terminology related to your field or role, it\'s likely they haven\'t necessarily worked in your position or industry. This is why it\'s crucial to use key phrases and key words that relate to the job you\'re applying for. Refer to the job description to identify exact things the company is looking for and work those things into your resume.\n\nPerson #2 Hiring Manager\n\nIf you make it past the screening call with HR or the recruiter, you\'ll move into the interview phrase where hiring managers get involved.\n\nAt this point, there are less candidates, and as a result, you can assume people are spending a little bit more than a few seconds looking at your resume. This is why it\'s crucial that your resume provide details of what you did. A resume with bullet points that all start with ""I was responsible for"" become repetitive, boring, and only speak to what you did but fail to explain how you did it and what happened.\n\nHiring managers don\'t want to just know about what you did. They also want to hear about how you did what you did. They want to know you can walk the walk not just talk the talk.\n\nFor example, if you are a researcher, don\'t say ""I was responsible for conducting customer research studies."" This only scratches the surface of what you did and in doing so, you are selling yourself short as a candidate. Instead, you could say ""I planned, conducted, oversaw, and analyzed, quarterly customer research studies including surveys and interviews with 200 customers each quarter.""\n\nProviding rich examples of what you did is more impactful than simply stating your experience as a list of responsibilities.\n\nPerson #3 The Team You\'ll be Working With\n\nIf you make it beyond the first interview, you\'ll encounter people who may be your future peers or colleagues, as well as people from other teams.\n\nThis is meant to help the team and hiring manager gain further understanding and confidence in your hard and soft skills. People who are from the team hiring you or have the same job title as you want assurance and evidence that you can do the job, do it well, and that they\'ll enjoy working with you.\n\nWhen they read your resume, they want to hear the details about what you\'ve worked on and the story behind a project or two, to get a sense of the depth of your skillset, how you work, and how you think, and how you approach problems. Ideally, you want your resume to spark their curiosity about projects you\'ve worked on and make them want to have a conversation with you about it in an interview.\n\nYour resume is more than just an inventory of your work history. When written strategically, it can help you stand out to the junior recruiter or person in the HR department, get selected for a screening interview, and increase the chances that you stand out enough from other candidates to progress in the interview process.\n\nWhen it comes to landing your next interview, keep in mind that people don\'t care what you did, they care how you did it. Your resume is about showcasing not just your output, but also your process and outcomes. https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahdoody/2023/04/12/how-to-write-and-design-your-resume-to-impress-3-key-people-in-the-hiring-process/"

"Spanish lawmakers consider plan to increase irrigation in one of Europe's most prized wetlands Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA plan to increase irrigation in an area adjoining one of Europe\'s most prized wetlands is set to advance Wednesday with the approval of lawmakers in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia.\n\nThe proposal to rezone the lands goes against the advice of ecologists and repeated warnings from Spain\'s central government and European Union officials.\n\nThe vote is expected to start the bill down the path toward becoming law. It is sponsored by the ruling conservative Popular Party, which holds an absolute majority in the regional parliament based in Seville. It also has the support of the far-right Vox party.\n\nIf the measure becomes law, some 3,700 acres of land near the Doñana nature reserve will be declared irrigable. This would grant an amnesty to the many farms that already use illegal wells to tap into the aquifer underlying the wetlands to grow strawberries for export across Europe.\n\nThe Popular Party says its intention is to help farmers who are in a legal limbo regularize their livelihoods, and pledges that the plan will not hurt the wetlands.\n\nSPANISH TV STAR REVEALS ADOPTED SURROGATE BABY BELONGS TO HER DECEASED SON: REPORT\n\nThe spokesman for Andalusia\'s government, Ramón Fernández-Pacheco, said that his government is committed to protecting Doñana and that the proposed bill would analyze case-by-case the farmers who ask for water rights.\n\n""I am worried that the EU is receiving a distorted image of what the bill says,"" he said.\n\nEcologists and opposition parties, however, accuse the Popular Party of trying to win votes ahead of regional elections on May 28. The bill could be pushed through before the elections, although that is not guaranteed.\n\nCracks in the mud are seen in a dry wetland in Donana natural park, Spain, on Oct. 19, 2022.

"ACM Prize in Computing Recognizes Yael Tauman Kalai for Fundamental Contributions to Cryptography Verifiable Delegation and Other Breakthrough Works Have Advanced the Field\n\nNEW YORK, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, today named Yael Tauman Kalai the recipient of the 2022 ACM Prize in Computing for breakthroughs in verifiable delegation of computation and fundamental contributions to cryptography. Kalai\'s contributions have helped shape modern cryptographic practices and provided a strong foundation for further advancements.\n\nThe ACM Prize in Computing recognizes early-to-mid-career computer scientists\n\nThe ACM Prize in Computing recognizes early-to-mid-career computer scientists whose research contributions have fundamental impact and broad implications. The award carries a prize of $250,000, from an endowment provided by Infosys Ltd.\n\nVerifiable Delegation of Computation Kalai has developed methods for producing succinct proofs that certify the correctness of any computation. This method enables a weak device to offload any computation to a stronger device in a way that enables the results to be efficiently checked for correctness. Such succinct proofs have been used by numerous blockchain companies (including Ethereum) to certify transaction validity and thereby overcome key obstacles in blockchain scalability, enabling faster and more reliable transactions. Kalai\'s research has provided essential definitions, key concepts, and inventive techniques to this domain.\n\nMore specifically, Kalai\'s work pioneered the study of ""doubly efficient"" interactive proofs, which ensure that the computational overhead placed on the strong device is small (nearly linear in the running time of the computation being proved). In contrast, previous constructions incurred an overhead that is super-exponential in the space of the computation. Kalai\'s work transformed the concept of delegation from a theoretical curiosity to a reality in practice. Her subsequent work used cryptography to develop certificates of computation, eliminating the need for back-and-forth interaction. This work used insights from quantum information theory, specifically ""non-signaling"" strategies, to construct a one-round delegation scheme for any computation. These schemes have led to a body of work on delegation including theoretical advancements, applied implementations, and real-world deployment.\n\nAdditional Contributions to Cryptography Kalai\'s other important contributions include her breakthrough work on the security of the ""Fiat-Shamir paradigm,"" a general technique for eliminating interaction from interactive protocols. This paradigm is extensively utilized in real-world applications including in the most prevalent digital signature scheme (ECDSA) which is used by all iOS and Android mobile devices. Despite its widespread adoption, its security has been poorly understood. Kalai\'s research established a solid foundation for understanding the security of this paradigm. In addition, she co-pioneered the field of leakage resilient cryptography and solved a long-standing open problem in interactive coding theory, showing how to convert any interactive protocol into one that is resilient to a constant fraction of adversarial errors while increasing the communication complexity by at most a constant factor and the running time by at most a polynomial factor. Kalai\'s extensive work in the field of cryptography has helped shape modern cryptographic practices and provided a strong foundation for further advancements.\n\n""As data is the currency of our digital age, the work of cryptographers, who encrypt and decrypt coded language, is essential to keeping our technological systems secure and our data private, as necessary,"" said ACM President Yannis Ioannidis. ""Kalai has not only made astonishing breakthroughs in the mathematical foundations of cryptography, but her proofs have been practically useful in areas such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Her research addresses complex problems whose solution opens new directions to where the field is heading--focusing on keeping small computers (such as smartphones) secure from potentially malicious cloud servers. A true star all around, she has also established herself as a respected mentor, inspiring and cultivating the next generation of cryptographers.""\n\n""We are pleased to see one of the world\'s leading cryptographers recognized,"" said Salil Parekh, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys. ""Kalai\'s technical depth and innovation of her work has definitely made a tremendous mark in this field and will inspire aspiring cryptographers. We are thankful for her contributions to date and can only imagine what she has in store in the coming years. Infosys has been proud to sponsor the ACM Prize since its inception. Recognizing the achievements of young professionals is especially important in computing, as bold innovations from people early in their careers have a tremendous impact on our field.""\n\nKalai will be formally presented with the ACM Prize in Computing at the annual ACM Awards Banquet, which will be held this year on Saturday, June 10 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco.\n\nBiographical Background Yael Tauman Kalai is a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research and an Adjunct Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Kalai earned a BSc in Mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, an MS in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from The Weizmann Institute of Science, and a PhD in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nKalai\'s honors include the George M. Sprowls Award for Best Doctoral Thesis in Computer Science (MIT, 2007), an IBM PhD Fellowship (2004-2006), an MIT Presidential Graduate Fellowship (2003-2006), and an Outstanding Master\'s Thesis Prize (Weizmann Institute of Science, 2001). She is a Fellow of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). Additionally, Kalai gave an Invited Talk at the International Congress of Mathematics (ICM, 2018).\n\nAbout the ACM Prize in Computing The ACM Prize in Computing recognizes an early to mid-career fundamental innovative contribution in computing that, through its depth, impact, and broad implications, exemplifies the greatest achievements in the discipline. The award carries a prize of $250,000. Financial support is provided by an endowment from Infosys Ltd. The ACM Prize in Computing was previously known as the ACM-Infosys Foundation Award in the Computing Sciences from 2007 through 2015. ACM Prize recipients are invited to participate in the Heidelberg Laureate Forum, an annual networking event that brings together young researchers from around the world with recipients of the ACM A.M. Turing Award, the Abel Prize, the Fields Medal, and the IMU Abacus Medal (a continuation of the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize).\n\nAbout ACM ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, is the world\'s largest educational and scientific computing society, uniting computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field\'s challenges.

"An Ohio couple found a cheap laundromat on Craigslist. Now they're millionaires. A little change can go a long way.\n\nIt did for Dave Menz, a 46-year-old real estate investor in Cincinnati, Ohio, who calls himself the Laundromat Millionaire.\n\nThe four laundromats Menz operates with his wife, Carla -- along with their consulting business helping other laundromat owners get started and grow their businesses -- have, indeed, made them rich. The couple has a net worth of $3.4 million, according to financial documents reviewed by Insider.\n\nIn just 13 years, Menz has gone from working a 9-to-5 job at his local telephone company to building a mini-empire of laundromats that brought in $1.8 million in revenue in 2022. Insider verified Menz\'s income.\n\nIn the last few years, the Menzes started helping other aspiring real-estate investors take the same path.\n\nThey offer workshops, conferences, and consulting services for fees ranging from $10 to $4,000 to people who want to get started investing in laundromats or existing operators who want to grow their businesses. This line of business brought in $320,000 in 2022, pushing their total gross revenue up to $2.2 million last year, according to documents viewed by Insider.\n\n""We\'ve really fallen in love with the impact that a newer laundromat with new technology and nice facilities has on a community,"" Menz said.\n\nHe shared the details of the journey with Insider.\n\nMenz spent the first decade of his life living in ""pretty extreme poverty"" in Flint, Michigan, he told Insider in 2021.\n\nWhen he was 11, his dad got a job as a computer programmer at a hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, and moved the family there. The Menz family ""went from being pretty poor to probably lower middle class to maybe even middle class,"" he said.\n\nCincinnati has been good to him ever since.\n\nHe became a 411 operator at Cincinnati Bell, a local telephone company, at 19. Over 17 years, he rose through the ranks and eventually became a lineman.\n\nMenz realized early on that he wanted to be his own boss. He and Carla began living frugally while squirreling away any extra income from his day job to eventually pursue entrepreneurship.\n\n""We lived well below our means and saved a lot of money,"" he said.\n\nIn early 2010, Queen City Laundry -- named after one of the nicknames for Cincinnati -- was born.\n\nMenz found his first laundromat on Craigslist. He was able to take control of a rundown facility in the Cincinnati suburb of Amelia for $85,000, using $30,000 the couple had saved and a small business loan.\n\nMenz used their remaining savings to renovate: He painted, opened up the floor plan, and added a video surveillance system. Those steps made it ""clean, bright and safe,"" he said, ""the three main components"" of a laundromat. He took out an equipment loan to buy new washers and dryers.\n\nJust seven months after the purchase, the laundromat was bringing in around $14,000 a month. After expenses, Menz was making a monthly profit of about $1,500, which he reinvested into business.\n\nWhile the income wasn\'t much, Menz told Insider that he expected a slow start. He kept his full-time job so he and Carla could pay back the loans, cover utilities, and afford raising three kids, now age 25, 15, and 13.\n\nBusiness only grew from there.\n\nIn late 2010, Menz acquired a second laundromat, this one in a Cincinnati strip mall that had been abandoned by a previous operator.\n\n""I knew I had a mess on my hands,"" he said, ""but it was a great location."" There was no competition nearby, he added.\n\nThe landlords were so eager to get the place up and running again that they gave Menz three months of free rent, a discounted ongoing rent of $1,100 a month, and a few thousand dollars for renovations, he told Insider.\n\nThat location, which opened in January 2011, became profitable within three weeks, Menz said.\n\nBy early 2014, the two locations were bringing in $7,000 a month.\n\nAround that time, Menz negotiated a deal for a third location, in Anderson Township, a small village east of Cincinnati.\n\nHe purchased the laundromat business for $75,000 and the building it was in for $170,000. After eight months of renovations, that outpost opened, and started to generate $3,000 to $4,000 per month.\n\nBy the fall of 2014, Menz was making enough money to quit his job at the phone company. He paid himself about $70,000 annually and reinvested the rest into the business.\n\nOver the next couple of years, Menz added a wash, dry, and fold service to all three locations. While it cost time and money in the beginning to implement, it ended up creating another revenue stream.\n\nIn 2016, Menz took control of a fourth laundromat for about $35,000.\n\nIn 2022, the Menzes gave up their first location and used the proceeds to open a 9,000-square-foot facility down the road.\n\nIt acts as the headquarters for the couple\'s laundry operations as well as their coaching and consulting work. It\'s also a community hub where they host workshops for aspiring laundromat owners and free pizza parties open to all.\n\nMenz\'s strategy isn\'t all about growing his portfolio, he told Insider.\n\nHe constantly upgrades and tweaks his four locations to make sure they are not, as he put it, ""just that 13th pizza place on the corner.""\n\nThat means having attendants at every location, making sure the storefronts are clean, and providing services beyond just washers and dryers.\n\nThe couple has a team of 40 employees who run day-to-day operations at their locations while they focus on expanding the consulting and coaching portion of their business.\n\nThey believe that laundromats offer more to neighborhoods than just a place to clean clothes. Menz called them ""a vital community resource.""\n\n""If we\'re underserving or not properly serving our community, the community literally suffers,"" he added. ""It\'s not something to play around with. https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-achieve-financial-freedom-by-investing-in-laundromats-2021-4"
"A Panda Is Coming Home, and Her Chinese Fans Say It's About Time She was in bad shape physically, and appeared to be seriously suffering from skin disease,"" Mr. Zhang said by telephone. He said the bamboo she was being fed didn\'t look fresh to him.\n\nChina has engaged in ""panda diplomacy"" since 1972, when its leader Mao Zedong promised two of the animals to President Richard M. Nixon. In 1984, China -- the only country where pandas can be found in the wild -- finalized an arrangement in which they would be sent to overseas zoos for 10 years at a time.\n\nEighteen countries now have pandas on loan from China; they arrive in pairs, inevitably with great fanfare. Analysts say China uses them to project a friendly image and to reward countries it\'s pleased with. (When President Emmanuel Macron of France visited China last week, a French zoo director was in his delegation; on Tuesday, French and Chinese media reported that two pandas at the ZooParc de Beauval, Huan Huan and Yuan Zai, would have their stay extended through 2027.)\n\nMatthew Fraser, an associate professor at the American University of Paris specializing in soft power and geopolitics, said that Beijing uses pandas to leverage its interests with trading partners. While politics are rarely cited explicitly when pandas are returned, he added, such gestures are often full of symbolic meaning, since the species is native only to China and inevitably become star attractions -- and main revenue drivers -- at zoos.\n\n""Almost always when China gives a panda to a zoo in another country, it is usually facilitating some kind of good will and very frequently a trade deal,"" he said in a phone interview. ""When China takes back a panda, it\'s usually because the regime is very displeased for some reason. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/world/asia/panda-china-memphis-zoo-ya-ya.html"

"8 Ways to Know if You Have a Vitamin Deficiency     - CNET For most people, a well-balanced diet is the key to getting all the nutrients needed to function. When your diet isn't giving you enough nutrients, then there are vitamin supplements that act as a safety net to fill the gaps for what you're not eating.\n\nBut did you know that you can do everything right and still have a vitamin deficiency? That's because everyone is different, and our bodies need different things. A general multivitamin may not address a significant deficiency in certain nutrients. It's important to know the symptoms of vitamin deficiencies so you can spot them if they crop up and adjust your diet accordingly.\n\nVitamin deficiencies are exactly as the name implies: Your body operates without enough of a particular nutrient. They are incredibly common; it's estimated that 2 billion people worldwide have a vitamin deficiency.\n\nVitamin deficiencies are divided into two categories -- primary and secondary deficiencies. A primary vitamin deficiency means that you need to take in more of the foods the vitamin contains. In this case, you can often tailor your diet to ensure you address these needs. Or take a supplement if you have dietary limitations that keep you from eating these foods, which is the case with food allergies.\n\nSecondary deficiencies occur when your body isn't absorbing nutrients as it should. This can happen because of an underlying condition such as celiac disease or cystic fibrosis. Additionally, secondary deficiency results from our bodies absorbing fewer nutrients as we age. Then the malabsorption can compound and cause other deficiencies, like in the case of calcium and vitamin D. Older adults whose body has stopped making vitamin D can develop a calcium deficiency because vitamin D is crucial for the absorption of calcium.\n\nVitamin deficiencies are common. However, they don't always present with symptoms you may associate with a vitamin deficiency. Here are the common signs of vitamin deficiencies that you may be ignoring.\n\nOne of the most prevalent vitamin deficiency symptoms is fatigue or feeling weak and tired. Many things can cause this, which makes it difficult to separate symptoms that stem from something else, like sleep deprivation. Chronic fatigue that doesn't go away no matter how much you sleep or rest may indicate a vitamin deficiency.\n\nFatigue signals a deficiency in:\n\nAnother common sign of vitamin deficiency is muscle weakness or cramps. Again, this one is hard to pinpoint directly to nutrients, given that you could be sore or have achy joints for many reasons. The most well-known deficiency associated with muscle weakness is vitamin D. However, several B vitamins and magnesium can also contribute to weakness.\n\nMuscle weakness and achy joints can indicate a deficiency of:\n\nAddressing your diet to see where you're lacking is the first step you can take to address a vitamin deficiency. It's worth visiting your doctor if you can't find obvious gaps in your nutrition.\n\nHair loss can happen for several reasons like genetics, medical conditions, hair treatment and hormonal imbalances. Missing out on key hair growth nutrients also may be the cause. If your hair is thinning or isn't as healthy as it used to be, it may be because you're not getting enough of these nutrients:\n\nIt's important to note that unless your hair loss or damage is due to a vitamin deficiency, taking vitamins won't make your hair grow back thicker. Finding the source of your hair loss is the only way to know how to address it. Hair growth vitamins can help you keep your health healthy only if you have a deficiency, but they're not magic pills. You're always better off focusing on your diet that supports hair health.\n\nEven if you use moisturizers and everything you're supposed to, you can still be left with dry skin or dandruff. Your diet may be to blame for this. Having enough of the right vitamins and minerals is essential for healthy, hydrated skin and scalp. It's not just dry skin -- scaly patches, bumps and dandruff all indicate a possible vitamin deficiency.\n\nIf you're experiencing dry skin, you may be deficient in these vitamins:\n\nSeveral vitamins are essential to a functioning immune system: vitamins E, C and K. Vitamin K is the nutrient required to form clots. Without an adequate amount in your body, a normal cut can turn into a big problem. This also applies to internal bleeding, which is difficult to identify without medical intervention.\n\nVitamin deficiencies don't only determine how long you bleed; they also affect how long it takes a wound to heal. Vitamin C functions with anti-inflammatory properties that help close wounds. A deficiency will slow tissue repair.\n\nNutrient deficiencies in these vitamins can affect your immune system and ability to heal wounds:\n\nVitamin deficiencies can also dictate how you feel. Most people are familiar with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that happens when there is less sunlight to give us vitamin D. However, mood changes and depression because of a vitamin D deficiency aren't limited to winter months. It's estimated that 42% of Americans are not getting enough vitamin D.\n\nVitamin B6 deficiencies have also been found to contribute to mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. While more research is needed, several studies suggest that taking vitamin B6 supplements can help reduce symptoms because it produces chemical messengers that inhibit brain impulses, which results in a calming effect.\n\nIn addition to naturally occurring changes in our vision that happen with age, a vitamin A deficiency can contribute to vision problems. Vitamin A plays a key role in vision by aiding the production of pigments for the retina. Without enough vitamin A, production stops, leading to night blindness or the compromised ability to see in low light and darkness.\n\nNight blindness can occur independently of vitamin A deficiencies, so you shouldn't start taking a supplement unless you know the source. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it accumulates in our body's fat stores. An excess is called vitamin A toxicity, marked by symptoms like headaches, joint pain and nausea.\n\nVitamin E is an antioxidant that's essential for eye health. A deficiency can lead to vision loss over time.\n\nA lesser-known and more alarming sign that you may have a vitamin deficiency is tingling in the hands, legs and feet. The main culprit of this deficiency is vitamin B12, which plays a role in our nervous system by producing myelin. Myelin is the protective layer that wraps around the nerve. A lack of B12 means your body won't produce enough myelin, and your nerves are susceptible to damage. Then you feel prickling or pins and needles on your hands and feet.\n\nNutrients that are related to tingling in the hands and feet:\n\nIf you're experiencing any tingling or numbness that persists, talk to your doctor immediately to find the cause and make a treatment plan.\n\nAnyone can have a vitamin deficiency. They're often overlooked because of how common some of the symptoms are. However, symptoms shouldn't be ignored, especially those affecting your ability to move, lift and see. Making lifestyle and dietary changes is the best way to stop deficiencies. Though taking supplements is also common.\n\nTalk to your doctor if you've had persistent symptoms that aren't linked to anything else. They can run blood tests to definitively diagnose and create a treatment plan. https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/8-ways-to-know-if-you-have-a-vitamin-deficiency/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"6 Best Natural Sugar Alternatives     - CNET In the age of processed foods, the American diet has changed rapidly. Sugar intake -- particularly added, refined sugars that aren't naturally part of the foods you consume -- has increased dramatically, leaving many of us feeling addicted to sweetness.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average adult consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugars daily, far above recommended levels. An ideal diet consists of no more than 10% calories from added sugar, which would be 12 teaspoons in an average 2,000-calorie intake.\n\nMany people already agree with what the data confirms: we eat too much sugar. If that's you and you're looking for ways to cut added sugar out of your diet, read on to learn some of the best sugar alternatives.\n\nBefore we get into sugar alternatives, it's important to clarify that sugar isn't inherently bad for you. In fact, it's vital for your health. Your body turns carbohydrates into glucose, a form of sugar, and this is a primary source of energy to keep your body moving and your brain functioning. Despite what some popular diet fads advocate, without carbs and sugars, you may experience health problems and symptoms such as low energy, sleep problems and brain fog.\n\nThe goal shouldn't be to avoid sugar but to consume the right kinds of sugar. Much of today's American diet consists of added sugars, which are processed and refined to add intense sweetness without much substance. Ultra-refined white sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are common ingredients in sodas, pastries, bread and condiments. These get delivered quickly to your bloodstream without adding other nutritional value along the way. Excessive consumption of these sugars can lead to serious health complications, including high blood pressure, diabetes and fatty liver disease.\n\nYou can find the amount of added sugars on the nutrition facts label and ingredients list of any food item. The higher up added sugar is on the ingredients list, the more sugar is in the product. Added sugars go by a lot of different names, such as brown sugar, corn sweeteners, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, malt syrup, maltose and sucrose.\n\nIn contrast, natural sugars are unrefined or only lightly processed and found naturally in many foods. Fruits contain fructose, for example, but they're also high in fiber, providing a balanced combination of nutrients for your body. Honey and maple syrup are naturally sweet but also rich in minerals, vitamins and antioxidants.\n\nThere are also various natural sweeteners and sugar substitutes that you can add to food and beverages that provide sweetness without the downsides of refined sugars. Examples of these alternative sugars include sugar alcohols like sorbitol, artificial sweeteners like aspartame and natural sweeteners like stevia.\n\nHere's the good news: If you want to cut back on sugar, you still have plenty of options for keeping things sweet. Below are six of the best natural sugar alternatives you can add to your diet in place of refined sugars.\n\nHoney has long been appreciated not only for its natural sweetness but also for its nutritional value. Because it's made by bees from plant nectar in the process of pollination, honey contains an array of beneficial plant compounds and antioxidants.\n\nRaw and darker honey, which are minimally processed, are rich in flavonoids and phenolic acids, in particular. These offer many benefits, including positive effects on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and respiratory health. It's even been shown to reduce seasonal allergies.\n\nAnother popular natural sweetener, maple syrup, has claimed its place atop many pancakes. If you're cutting back on sugar, you may want to skip the pancakes but hang on to the syrup, which is produced from the sap of sugar maple trees.\n\nThat's because maple syrup, like honey, contains antioxidants and minerals that can be beneficial for your health. Many of the unique compounds found in maple syrup have, in fact, been shown to help combat cancer and diabetes. The darker the maple syrup, the less refined it is -- and the more of these benefits it may provide.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the flavor of maple syrup or honey but still want a way to sweeten up beverages and recipes, stevia is a great natural sugar alternative to try. This sweetener is made from the Stevia plant, and it's 200 to 400 times sweeter than table sugar.\n\nAs a sugar substitute, stevia is non-nutritive, meaning it contains almost no calories. It adds sweetness without much else, and that may be just what you're looking for when cutting back on sugar. Stevia has also been correlated with reduced blood sugar and cholesterol. Keep in mind that many stevia products on the market contain other processed ingredients or sugar alcohols, so it's important to do your research before using them.\n\nIf you're looking for a more nutritionally balanced form of sugar, it's tough to beat raw fruits. The dietary fiber present in raw fruits aids in digestion and slows down sugar metabolism, reducing blood sugar spikes you might see from fruit juice or sugar additives. Eating fiber-rich foods can also help you reduce your total caloric intake and lower your risk of heart disease.\n\nPureed fruits give you many of the same benefits, and they can serve as sweeteners to add to other foods. Applesauce works as an egg substitute in many recipes, for instance, and pureed berries make a great addition to plain, unsweetened yogurt.\n\nMonk fruit is another plant-based alternative sugar. This one is extracted from monk fruit, also known as luo han guo, a small round fruit that's commonly found in Southeast Asia. Although monk fruit itself contains fructose and glucose, these are actually removed in the extraction process, creating a non-nutritive sweetener that's around 100 times sweeter than table sugar.\n\nMonk fruit is relatively new to the market, so it needs further study to determine all its potential health benefits. However, research on other non-nutritive sweeteners shows promising results in terms of weight management and fending off diabetes. The naturally sweet mogrosides in monk fruit also contain antioxidants, which can help with immune health and cancer prevention.\n\nFruit juice is a natural sweetener that you can drink on its own or add to other beverages or condiments or even use in cooking. 100% fruit juice is a much better option than refined table sugar or high-fructose corn syrup because fruit juice is natural and unprocessed. It also contains loads of vitamins and nutrients. https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/6-best-natural-sugar-alternatives/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"The surprising afterlife of a '70s L.A. cult: How the Source Family became hot IP in 2023 Father Yod just gave me a thought for you. He wants me to tell you, \'Camelot.\'""\n\nOn a Zoom call in March from her home in Oahu, Hawaii, Isis Aquarian recounted her time in the Los Angeles spiritual commune the Source Family, which she -- through telepathic messages from the group\'s leader -- likened to the romantic symbol of the Arthurian world.\n\nIn the 1970s, dressed in stylish, flowing gowns, caftans, robes and headscarves, she all but resembled Guinevere. ""It was pure Camelot for all of us. For those who experienced it, it was something else,"" she added. For Isis, the Family was tantamount to utopia.\n\nKnown for its pioneering in California lifestyle staples like health food, yoga, psychedelic rock and hippie fashion, the group\'s leader, Father Yod, née Jim Baker, ""left the body"" in 1975, after a hang gliding accident in Hawaii, where the Family relocated in 1974. But Isis, now 80, said their union -- she was one of Yod\'s 14 spiritual wives -- never ended. ""He\'s still the big guy to me, still my man,"" she said. ""When you live in both dimensions, the veil is very thin.""\n\nTo an outsider, Isis\' casual references to telepathy and interdimensional existence may sound delusional. But for members of the Source Family, a group that some call a cult, it\'s a way of life honed over decades of study and ritualism based in Western esotericism. Their beliefs amalgamated principles developed by Kundalini yoga progenitor Yogi Bhajan; the astrological concept of the Age of Aquarius; the teachings of Manly P. Hall, founder of the Philosophical Research Society in Los Feliz; the freemasons and others. Father Yod bestowed each member with a first name; they changed their middle and last names to the Aquarian. Like many religious and spiritual groups, the Source Family placed their faith in things invisible to nonbelievers.\n\nFather Yod, however, was hard to miss.\n\nTheir guru\'s virile presence and checkered past preceded him in his days as a figure on the Sunset Strip. As the story goes, Midwest native Baker was a successful restaurateur and Hollywood socialite, and also a convicted killer and suspected bank robber. At one point, his hands were registered as lethal weapons. He moved to L.A. after World War II to audition for a role as Tarzan.\n\nWhere to see classic performances from David Bowie, Linda Ronstadt and Tina Turner? YouTube is now home to clips from Burt Sugarman\'s late-night show.\n\nInspired by the proto-hippie lifestyle led by Nature Boys Gypsy Boots and eden ahbez, he opened early health food eateries the Old World and Aware Inn. In the late \'60s, he studied with Yogi Bhajan, and began creating his own philosophy that blended various spiritual rituals, au natural living and far-out ideas like ""sex magick."" He then transformed into Father Yod (which he described as ""the principle and origin of all things, the I, the active principle, the image of masculinity"") and, later, YaHoWah (drawn from the Hebrew name for God). He developed a daily routine for the Family consisting of 40 instructions that included chanting ""YaHoWha"" throughout the day, breathing techniques, meditation, visualization, kindness to strangers and a six-count inhalation of the ""Sacred Herb"" (cannabis).\n\nFather Yod opened the Source restaurant at 8301 Sunset Blvd. in 1969 to support his growing family of followers, and it became one of the first hotspots in L.A. for organic vegetarian food. Stars such as Steve McQueen, Goldie Hawn, Marlon Brando, Joni Mitchell and John Lennon dined on its famous patio. It became so synonymous with the only-in-L.A. narrative that it was satirized by Woody Allen in ""Annie Hall"" and by ""Saturday Night Live.""\n\nThe Family moved into a Georgian-style mansion in Los Feliz, former home of L.A. Times owners the Chandlers, which they dubbed the Mother House, in 1972. While there, they spent $30,000 on instruments and recording equipment and began tracking and pressing psychedelic rock and singer-songwriter music. After they lost their lease, they relocated to a much smaller, three-bedroom home in Nichols Canyon. At its peak, the Source Family counted around 140 members, including Lovely Previn, daughter of pianist and composer André Previn, Sky Saxon of garage-rock band the Seeds and the niece of former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.\n\nThough the Source Family disbanded in 1978, fascination with the group and its practices has surged in the new millennium. Since the mid-aughts, there have been documentary films, books and multiple CD and vinyl record reissues of the group\'s music. Bootleg T-shirts, hoodies, mugs and stickers appear in Google search results. All of these may be traced to a vast collection of images, video and audio recordings, recipes and manifestos that has survived the march of time.\n\nAfter joining the Family in 1972, Isis Aquarian, who was born Charlene Peters, the daughter of an archivist for the Air Force and NASA, served as the group\'s documentarian, creating the artful material that has been drawn from for various archival projects over the last 15 or so years. After the group fell apart, she made it her mission to preserve the Family\'s legacy.\n\nMost recently, in November, Isis, curator Charlie Kitchings and filmmaker and publisher Jodi Wille, who has previously worked with Isis on a book and a feature documentary, released ""Family: The Source Family Scrapbook"" in conjunction with the independent record label Sacred Bones. The book includes previously unpublished photographs and ephemera from Isis\' archive and detailed captions that contextualize the images. Isis also moved her archive, around 50 boxes of materials, to the American Religions Collection at the UC Santa Barbara library. In conjunction with the book\'s release, a series of Source Family events took place in Santa Barbara, Los Feliz, Malibu and Culver City in late March.\n\nAnd now, Hollywood is getting involved.\n\nAt a private dinner in Malibu on March 25 sponsored by the media company Atlas Obscura, guests including actors Patricia Arquette and Mark Ruffalo, music producer Rick Rubin, actor and producer Ben Sinclair, original Source Family members and other curious parties were invited on ""a journey into the cult roots of health food."" The menu, inspired by dishes at the original Source restaurant, featured seven courses including ""psychedelic toast,"" ""multidimensional soup"" and a re-creation of the restaurant\'s ""aware salad,"" served by staff engaged in Source Family cosplay, dressed in flowing white frocks and wigs. Isis and fellow Source Family members Venus, Zerathustra and Galaxy Aquarian blessed the meal with a ritual they performed in the Family. ""As above, so below, and around, we go, YaHoWah,"" they chanted with corresponding hand gestures, as if guiding energy around the 40-person table decorated with poppies, dill flowers, wheat and cut papaya, a flower child\'s rendering of a medieval banquet.\n\nArquette, who spent her childhood in a Subud commune in Virginia, said she\'s always been fascinated by various religious philosophies and spiritual seekers. ""It\'s been nice to talk to these elders who are here, about their radical experiences as young people,"" she said. ""Especially when they talked about how Father Yod went down his own ego path. That they acknowledged it made me feel like there\'s not an absolute revisionist history.""\n\n\'It\'s just a bottomless well of love and emotion,\' says Phoebe Bridgers of being in a band with Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus.\n\nThe Malibu event doubled as a hub of in-progress Hollywood spiritual ventures. According to Wille, Ruffalo, his manager Margaret Riley and the producer Stacey Sher are working on a Source Family limited series in which Ruffalo will play Father Yod. Sinclair is developing a series about the spiritual leader Ram Dass while Rubin is producing a docuseries about Yogi Bhajan. Two days after the event in Malibu, Rubin sent a limo for Isis and interviewed her for three hours with a full camera crew because, he said by email, that he\'s ""excited by … Isis Aquarian\'s bird\'s-eye view of Jim Baker\'s evolution from successful man of the world to spiritual leader, whose ever-curious hunger for deeper spiritual connection was shared by 150 like-minded souls.""\n\nRubin said he learned about the Family after he moved to California in the late \'80s and began dining at the Source Restaurant. ""Something about the space held an energy even though the Source Family had already moved on."" During Father Yod\'s lifetime, wrote Rubin, ""The Source story was a local story. Now it\'s global.""\n\nThis renewed interest in the Source Family comes in addition to a rising interest in cults more broadly in popular consciousness, evident in the flood of streaming series such as Netflix\'s hit show ""Wild Wild Country,"" about the Rajneeshees; HBO\'s ""The Vow"" and Starz\'s ""Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult,"" competing programs about the high-profile NXIVM cult; Hulu\'s ""Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult of Sarah Lawrence""; Showtime\'s new ""Waco: The Aftermath""; and a myriad of documentaries, limited series and podcasts on Scientology, Branch Davidians, Jonestown, the polygamist Church of Latter Day Saints and the Manson Family.\n\nSo what keeps people coming back to the Source Family? The rise of wellness trends like sound baths and microdosing suggests a growing open-mindedness among America\'s upper middle class of mystics. But close examination of the Source Family, beyond its organic produce and hippie bon vivants, reveals an offbeat world that is perhaps too freaky for Goop Nation writ large. Southern California, however, is a different scene. ""In L.A., people like weirdos,"" Wille said. Los Angeles is also a hub for reinvention, a storied destination for seekers. It\'s true now, and it was true then. ""I was living in New York and was totally drawn to L.A.,"" Isis added. ""Everybody just started filtering into the Hollywood area.""\n\nWhen the Source Family formed, the social and political climate in the United States was volatile, with an unpopular war in Vietnam, the women\'s liberation movement, violence against Black citizens and assassinations of progressive leaders. A growing number of Americans desired a different way of life, to drop out of all the social and political heavyosity and create a better world. It\'s estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 communes existed in the United States in the 1960s and \'70s.\n\nFast-forward 50 years, and it seems that little has changed. ""What was happening back in the early \'70s was, in some ways, really similar to what\'s happening right now,"" Wille said ahead of a private dinner and public Q&A at a ranch in Malibu. ""There\'s political polarization and a lot of things that people are unhappy about.""\n\nAhead of the 50th anniversary of Gram Parsons\' death, Joshua Tree and National Park Service officials are bracing for an influx of fans. So is the famed Joshua Tree Inn.\n\nJ. Gordon Melton, retired distinguished professor of American religious history at Baylor University, who\'s studied new religious movements since the early \'70s, said that the Source Family managed to evade the burgeoning scholarship movement in its day, which became overshadowed by groups like the Unification Church, the Hare Krishna movement and the Church of Scientology. ""If this group had hung around for a couple of more years on the Sunset Strip, they would have been at the forefront of our consciousness,"" he said.\n\nAs for any dangers related to the Source Family, Melton said that such groups either have an inherently violent streak or react violently when they perceive an attack. ""And this group was never really attacked,"" he said. Unlike groups like the Manson Family and the Peoples Temple, the Source Family didn\'t engage in mass suicide or murder, though their staunch refusal of Western medicines resulted in at least one very sick child being admitted to a Los Angeles hospital.\n\nZarathustra Aquarian; his wife, Amy; and their daughter, Alyah -- who\'s also a ""psychedelic clown"" who leads ""interdimensional travel demonstration and practicum"" -- applauded the discipline and openness that Father Yod\'s teachings introduced. Zarathustra and Amy applied many of the Family\'s principles in their marriage, including natural childbirth and the belief that sex is sacred, even though they didn\'t get together until years after the Source Family fell apart. ""It was the greatest utopian community to ever occur around spiritual work,"" he said.\n\nGalaxy Aquarian, born Dawn Hurwitz, joined the Family in 1972 when she was 16 years old, and eventually became one of Father Yod\'s spiritual wives and the clothier for the Family, making fantastical dresses and robes. She described her younger self as a firebrand who was getting into a lot of trouble, and said she appreciates the group\'s emphasis on consistency, kindness and honesty.\n\n""I took a lot of that with me, but I\'ve adapted to life,"" she said. ""I married another man. I\'ve worn several hats."" She\'s working on a memoir about her time in the Family, which she was asked not to promote during the events. Hurwitz spoke during a Q&A in Los Feliz, but not at the roundtable in Malibu two days later.\n\nThough interest in the Source Family seems to be reaching an apex, it\'s been a long time coming. ""Record collectors knew about them before anybody else,"" said John Wyatt, founder of Cinespia, which screens classic films in locations across the city. Since the 1990s, he\'s been a collector of rare, obscure and private press records sourced from area thrift stores, estate sales and flea markets.\n\nWyatt recalled a time when vendors were moving records by Ya Ho Wah 13, Father Yod and the Spirit of \'76 and other Family-related recordings for $20 or less because the Source had fallen out of fashion and the sellers ""didn\'t know what they had."" The first Source-related album he bought was ""Penetration, An Aquarian Symphony,"" a four-song heavy-psych improvisation with fateful guitars, whistling and off-kilter percussion. ""It blew my mind,"" he exclaimed while studying his copy. ""The cover image with the gong, the label design, that they had their own Higher Key Records.""\n\nAs is the case with a lot of niche music, word eventually spread. Some Source-related recordings were included in author Patrick Lundborg\'s 2006 book ""The Acid Archives,"" a North Star for certain music lovers. Today, original pressings of records featuring Father Yod -- there were about 20 LPs and 45s released in the 1970s -- sell for hundreds of dollars.\n\nA Q&A at the Philosophical Research Society on March 23, which followed a screening of Wille\'s 2013 documentary ""The Source Family,"" made with Maria Demopoulos, turned into one of the more heated discussions that Wille and the Family have participated in since they began working together. Some audience members implied that the film\'s narrative arc, and the family member\'s answers that night, were selective, omitting Father Yod\'s use of alcohol and cocaine. One questioner politely asked if the three female Family members on stage -- Isis, Galaxy and Venus -- if they were aware, at the time, of the negative perspectives presented in the film, or if they feel negatively about the Family today. Another asked about patriarchy and power structures.\n\nAt one point, a former Source Family member, Hail Aquarian, stood up in the audience and approached the stage with a small dog and some tea to spill. In a lengthy anecdote, he implied that Father Yod expressed his intent to ""leave the body"" to a few Family members a month before the actual hang gliding accident, undermining the narrative that Yod never traveled alone or without all of his wives. ""I never heard anything about that,"" Isis responded before debating the claim.\n\n""That got a little spicy,"" Wille reflected, two days later in Malibu. ""It\'s really interesting to think about wild social experiments that were happening in the \'70s when no one was monitoring things or canceling things,"" she added. ""What I like most is that the Source Family members each have their own ideas.""\n\nAs long as she\'s visible to others in this Earthly dimension, Isis Aquarian will keep promoting the Family and sharing her experience. In her estimation, all of ""the stories behind stories behind stories of everything"" are still unfolding. And Southern California will always be home, the place where she felt most understood. ""We were the darlings of L.A.,"" she said. https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-04-12/source-family-cult-l-a-father-yod-mark-ruffalo-rick-rubin-vegetarian-restaurant"

"How To Manage Data For Customer-Focused Campaigns Ab Gaur is the Founder & CEO of Verticurl and also serves as Ogilvy\'s Chief Data and Technology Officer.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has forever impacted how consumers purchase products and services. To address ever-changing customer behaviors, companies must manage every stage of the buying process by improving their customer experience (CX), data and e-commerce strategies.\n\nBecause of this shift, however, companies are now collecting a deluge of customer data, including structured, unstructured and semi-structured data, that is both informing and eroding their ability to make data-driven decisions.\n\nAccording to one survey of CIOs and senior IT executives, nearly 75% of respondents reported difficulties managing data, and many companies are discarding up to 90% of their customer data. Simply put, decision makers understand that data is critical to driving marketing initiatives and sales outcomes, but the actual implementation is complicated.\n\nFor example, one Gartner survey found that marketing analytics only drive 53% of decisions as data-management difficulties, cognitive biases and other challenges restrict effective implementation. Similarly, the survey found that ""one-third of respondents reported that decision makers cherry-pick data to try to tell a story that aligns with their preconceived decisions or opinion.""\n\nNotably, while most companies can compete on technological capacity--something made more obvious with the release of popular new AI products--they often fail to connect with their customers as creative efforts and tactical execution fall short, ultimately diminishing their impact and market potential.\n\nIn order to overcome these hurdles, here are three best practices for leveraging customer data to make responsive marketing decisions that resonate with buyers, convert customers and maximize ROI.\n\nCreating a ""single view of the customer"" means having a complete and accurate understanding of a customer\'s needs, preferences and behaviors based on all of the data and interactions that a company has collected about them.\n\nThis outcome requires focused data sets emphasizing the most essential customer insights. To achieve this, leaders should gather the information to complete the 80/20 guiding principle, which posits that 80% of the results will be derived from 20% of the data, an outcome produced with progressive profiling that produces a single view of the customer across all touchpoints. For example, combining data for a large CPG company that spans multiple brands, products and buyers can produce a household view of product penetration and future growth opportunities.\n\nManaging the volume of customer data means implementing strategies for companies to collect, analyze and apply it with efficiency, precision and impact.\n\nIdeally, this single view of the customer will enable brands to prioritize real-time marketing that reaches the right customers with the right information at the right time.\n\nMore specifically, since time is people\'s most valuable resource, companies can maximize their limited touchpoints with interactions that foster emotional connections, respond to pain points and optimize the buying journey in real time.\n\nIncreasingly, real-time, personalized communication is a customer expectation. Adobe\'s most recent commerce survey found that 67% of consumers ""want personalized offers based on their individual spending habits,"" while personalized communications received 139% more engagement. In total, customers are 76% more likely to consider a purchase when they receive personalized communication within the marketing funnel.\n\nFor instance, a single view of the customer can enable time-sensitive communications tailored to enhance the consumer experience. This might include things like reminders to return to abandoned shopping carts or viewer recommendations on a streaming service.\n\nPairing the right data with capable technologies can empower these meaningful interactions. New AI-powered communications solutions are making this easier. By integrating functionality from platforms like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT, companies are already providing personalized content at scale in real time. Companies like Mastercard are deploying this technology to personalize and contextualize their customer support operations, and its impact is still being discovered and refined.\n\nFor companies of any size in any sector, customer data is key to marketing outcomes because it powers the personalization that people expect going forward.\n\nToday\'s data-driven advertising ecosystems free companies from preconceived funnel connections, exchanging generic touchpoints for personalized communications that iterate with every interaction. This guides customers through the buyer journey, providing progressively more personalized and impactful content and experiences that convert casual interest into bottom-line results.\n\nIterative interactions might include modifying a consumer\'s preferred communication channel based on self-identified personal preferences or connecting with customers on one channel or another based on engagement trends.\n\nRevamping CX, data and e-commerce strategies is critical for companies looking to stay ahead of ever-changing consumer behaviors. However, the deluge of customer data presents challenges in managing and leveraging it for marketing initiatives effectively.\n\nBy creating a single view of the customer, prioritizing real-time marketing initiatives and iterating with every interaction, companies can leverage data to drive marketing outcomes, increase customer engagement and maximize ROI.\n\nWhile technological capacity is essential, the ability to connect with customers creatively and execute tactically is equally important. By implementing these best practices, companies can foster emotional connections, respond to pain points and optimize the buying journey in real time, ultimately enhancing the customer experience and achieving business success.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

"Social Issues Impact Consumers' Choice Of Banks--Should Banks Take A Stand? Social issues, social change, social responsibility, mental health, climate change, ESG\n\nBanks\' attempts to steer clear of taking positions on controversial social issues like mental health, climate change, and ESG may be hurting their ability to acquire and retain customers according to new research.\n\nIf banks are confused by the advice they get on social issues, it\'s understandable.\n\nOn one hand, Boston Consulting Group claimed banks are ""uniquely positioned to have a broad and sizable impact on many social challenges"" and asserted, ""there is a clear business case for creating solutions to address social issues, including access to new markets, improved financial performance and cost of capital, ability to attract talent, and reduced reputational and regulatory risk.""\n\nOn the other hand, Senator Pat Toomey, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, accused banks of taking ""inappropriately"" liberal positions on social issues that ""harm America."" Toomey argued banks are ""out of bounds when they weigh in on non-banking issues like guns and abortion.""\n\nBCG\'s analysis is suspect, however, because it compared the performance of banks it considered to be ""leaders"" based on sustainability scores rom MSCI. The ""clear business case"" isn\'t that clear because: 1) there are more social issues than just environmental sustainability, and 2) BCG\'s data shows correlation--not causation--between sustainability scores and business performance.\n\nToomey\'s accusations are really the ones that are ""out of bounds"" since many organizations take stances on social issues that have nothing to do with the industries they operate in (it\'s called ""free speech"").\n\nThe vast majority of financial institutions shy away from taking a stand on social issues for a good reason: They don\'t want to piss anyone off.\n\nFor a long time, that approach worked. Back in 2012, I wrote that organizations had to practice ""political tightroping"" and explained:\n\n""Like it or not, this is a very polarized time in our history. Marketers can\'t afford to be on the wrong side of the fence and have to be extremely careful who their firm supports in political races and which proposed policies and regulations they support or oppose.""\n\nSome high-profile bank CEOs have deflected the question of taking a stand on social issues back to the government. In his 2022 letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wrote, ""we require a 21st century government--we need to find a way to more rapidly reorganize our government for the new world.""\n\nPNC CEO Bill Demchak believes the government should be the one to make policy choices on social and environmental issues, not banks. According to Demchak, ""trying to shame people out of certain exposures for social reasons without a plan, without a formidable plan on the other side to actually cause changes, is nuts.""\n\nTaking a stand on social issues may be the customer-centric thing to do, however.\n\nA new study from Cornerstone Advisors looked at consumers\' attitudes towards social issues and asked how social issues influenced their choice of banks and the relationships they have with financial providers. Key findings include:\n\nTaking a stand on social issues doesn\'t just mean making public proclamations.\n\nMore than half of Gen Zers and nearly half of Millennials would like to see messages about the social actions their bank are involved with when they log out of digital banking platforms. Banks can also address social issues via the products and services they offer, including:\n\nThe changes occurring in the American economy--combined with shifting views on social, political, and environmental issues--are generating the momentum to create meaningful change regarding how consumers consider and use financial services.\n\nThis change is most evident among Gen Z and Millennials who are early in their careers and looking to build and maintain wealth. With more than 110 million Americans between 20 and 45 years old, banks can\'t ignore their changing perspectives and behaviors.\n\nTaking a stand on social issues doesn\'t mean taking a stand on every issue, however. Aligning with one or two issues--like mental health, income equity, or gender equality--can help banks attract and retain young consumers who care deeply about the issues. And the banks can do so without alienating other customers or segments of the population. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2023/04/12/social-issues-impact-consumers-choice-of-banks-should-banks-take-a-stand/"
"How To Leverage The 2 Most Powerful Things That Shape Your Career How To Leverage The 2 Most Powerful Things That Shape Your Career\n\nWhy is it that when two people with the same experience and talent are in the same environment, one struggles while the other thrives?\n\nThe difference between them lies in two powerful yet often overlooked things crucial to your professional success: mindset and perspective.\n\nYour mindset is your mental attitude or outlook, while your perspective is how you see or interpret something.\n\nCombined, they become the lens through which you view yourself, your career, and the world. They affect the story you tell yourself and the story you tell others and impact your potential. Your mindset and perspective influence your behavior, thoughts, and opinions and how (or if) you believe you can make an impact.\n\nThe parable of the three bricklayers illustrates their importance:\n\nOnce upon a time, a traveler came upon three bricklayers.\n\nWhen asked by the traveler, ""What are you doing?"" the first bricklayer replied, ""I\'m laying bricks.""\n\nAsked the same question, the second bricklayer answered, ""I\'m putting up a wall.""\n\nThe third bricklayer considered the query and responded with pride in his voice, ""I\'m building a cathedral.""\n\nMindset and perspective are often the difference between someone\'s career soaring or sinking, so it pays to understand how to leverage them to maximize your professional potential. Here\'s how:\n\nIn her seminal book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, psychologist Carol Dweck coined the concept of growth and fixed mindsets.\n\nDweck says someone with a growth mindset views intelligence, abilities, and talents as learnable and capable of improvement through effort and practice. On the other hand, someone with a fixed mindset views those same traits as inherently stable and unchangeable over time. They believe they\'re either good at something or they\'re not.\n\nA growth mindset is linked to openness to new ideas and experiences, while a fixed mindset equates to resistance to change. Not surprisingly, a growth mindset correlates with career progress.\n\nThough we\'d all like to believe we operate from an optimal mindset and perspective, that isn\'t always the case. So ask yourself these two questions to determine your existing mindset and perspective:\n\nDo you feel you\'re doing ""just a job"" and that you\'re simply punching the clock? Unfortunately, you might be stuck in a fixed mindset where you believe your intelligence or talent is set in stone with no room for growth. Worse, you\'re likely allowing fear to creep in and make you feel that your actions don\'t matter.\n\nOn the other hand, if you believe that, like the third bricklayer in the previously mentioned parable, you\'re an integral part of building something important, you\'re likely operating from a growth mindset. You embrace your environment as a training ground and easily see how your collaboration with others and contributions, no matter how small, power the bigger picture.\n\nIf you\'re easily annoyed, feel like the world is out to get you, and are surrounded by idiots, you\'re likely seen as a pessimist.\n\nWhen we\'re pessimistic, we tend to adopt a victim mentality, which negatively affects our attitude in many other damaging ways. We tend to judge others and make up our minds before listening and learning about alternatives, which prevents our growth.\n\nHowever, if you tend to see the best in situations and are all about the possibilities, you\'re probably viewed as an optimist.\n\nOptimists tend to be curious and tolerant of new ideas and people and are less like to be thrown off course because of an unexpected setback. Their openness builds trust naturally, which allows them to connect with others more easily, paving the way for professional progress.\n\nFor better or worse, the mindset and perspective we hold is a choice and often correlate to the degree of pessimism or optimism we possess. Fortunately, even if you have a less-than-desirable mindset or perspective, you have the power to change them through awareness and intention.\n\nTo shift to a growth mindset and positive perspective, try to:\n\nRemember, your combined mindset and perspective are the lens through which you view yourself, your career, and the world. They influence your behavior, thoughts, and opinions and how (or if) you believe you can make an impact. By tapping into the power of a growth mindset and positive perspective, you can maximize your professional potential. https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyblaschka/2023/04/12/how-to-leverage-the-2-most-powerful-things-that-shape-your-career/"
"Less Is More: The Importance Of Intent-Based Retail Comms Cofounder and CEO of Zipline, a company that helps brick-and-mortar stores streamline communication and task management.\n\nFrom new store signage to holiday promotion protocols to business updates from HQ, keeping up with comms in retail can be akin to drinking from a firehose. When compounded with the fact that associates spend the day on their feet--and not in front of a computer primed to consume instruction--it\'s no surprise that only 29% of directions from HQ are reported to execute correctly and on time.\n\nTime and time again, I\'ve seen retailers try to solve this problem by ramping up their communication output: masterfully designed newsletters, perfectly timed emails, chat rooms to share real-time instruction and tightly organized tasks. ""Maybe if we just create more touchpoints, we\'ll get our message across.""\n\nIt\'s a seemingly logical conclusion that has a fallacy at its core. More is always more. And the result of this misconception is often the same: Oversaturated and disorganized communication channels fill up with inevitably contradictory information, fueling chat fatigue and leaving associates burnt out and unsure where to turn.\n\nWhat people often forget is that different communication channels satisfy different objectives. Understanding how to best utilize these channels and adopting an intentional ""less is more"" approach is the key to breaking the cycle and improving store execution.\n\nIn the two decades I\'ve spent working with retailers, I\'ve found that organizing comms into four distinct categories can alleviate unnecessary headaches and empower frontline workers.\n\nNice-to-know information makes people feel good. It\'s not directly actionable or strictly ""necessary,"" but it builds morale by bringing in elements like letters from the executive team, congratulatory messages, social media posts and partnerships. Portals, such as SharePoint, tend to support this sort of information best.\n\nNeed-to-know information is time sensitive and actionable--think tasks such as implementing signs, changing store pamphlets or creating terms and conditions for marketing events. This type of information often has a date associated with it, like an inventory count, to motivate employees accordingly.\n\nI find that task management software like Teamwork is the most effective way to transmit and manage this type of communication as it provides a way to monitor progress and ensure tasks are completed.\n\nEvergreen content works on longer timelines and doesn\'t require immediate action but should still be stored in a library for easy reference when needed. This could include resource guides, employee handbooks, seasonal training standards and healthcare benefits instructions.\n\nFile managers, like Box or Google Drive work best to store and organize this fixed content by making them searchable and accessible for an associate\'s reference at any time.\n\nDialogue, discussion and debate allow employees to share ideas through casual conversations that benefit the business as a whole. This could include brainstorming sessions or chat rooms where employees can freely discuss their suggestions for store success.\n\nFor example, the furniture business, American Signature, which I am familiar with since they work with my business, allows its 4,000 employees to collaborate on questions, brainstorm ideas and break down information from the home office. The company ensures that team members can be recognized, voice their opinions, find community regardless of physical location and advocate for customers.\n\nUtilizing tools like Slack or Yammer, or solutions built specifically for the complexity of stores, retailers can ensure their teams are constantly connected and have an intuitive place to meet and share ideas.\n\nBy engaging in these forms of communication, retailers can ensure their associates remain adequately informed on their responsibilities and goals without getting overwhelmed. An intent-based communications strategy allows staff to come together as a team and build relationships with customers while simultaneously keeping their goals and responsibilities top of mind.\n\nSo, the next time you have news to share with frontline employees, take a moment to consider which category it falls under to ensure you\'re sharing it via the most effective channel.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

"ChatGPT trick lets you integrate the AI bot into any iPhone app It seems there's very little that ChatGPT cannot do.\n\nThe artificial intelligence platform which has taken the world by storm has helped people write work reports, create diet plans and even apply for jobs.\n\nBut better still, there is now a way you can integrate the bot into any iPhone app -- and here's how.\n\nThe shortcut, which is free to everyone as long as they have set up an OpenAI pay-as-you-go billing plan, supports conversational mode so you can use ChatGPT just as you would on a computer.\n\nIt essentially lets you ask ChatGPT questions from an input box on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, with answers then returned by ChatGPT and displayed in an alert on your device.\n\nNew trick: You can now integrate ChatGPT into any iPhone app by using a new shortcut. This supports conversational mode so you can use ChatGPT just as you would on a computer\n\n'You can ask whatever you want, wait a couple of seconds, and get a response back from the assistant. S-GPT only supports text, and there are no limits in terms of question length,' said developer Federico Viticci, who explained why he chose to create the shortcut.\n\nThe S-GPT shortcut essentially lets you ask ChatGPT questions from an input box on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, with answers then returned by ChatGPT and displayed in an alert on your device.\n\nIt can be used with either the existing ChatGPT 3.5 model, or ChatGPT 4 if a user has access to it.\n\nHere is what you have to do:\n\nOne example of how S-GPT can be used is to make a playlist with certain artists.\n\nA user just has to give it a command, which is interpeted by ChatGPT and then passed back to S-GPT for the playlist to be named.\n\nOnce this is done, the playlist will appear in the Apple Music App.\n\nSpoiler alert: it wasn't just because he needed help writing poems on his phone.\n\nViticci said he wanted to be able to give Apple users the same access to ChatGPT as those with Windows devices.\n\nThe AI bot has a tie-up with Microsoft and has been rolled out in a new version of the tech giant's Bing search engine.\n\nThis agreement means those with iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS will likely always be unable to access ChatGPT in the same way, without Viticci's S-GPT (which stands for Shortcuts-GPT).\n\nHe said he wanted to build a bridge between Apple and ChatGPT, much like Microsoft has.\n\n'I know that this is a lofty goal, and there's only so much I can do with Shortcuts, but I look at how Microsoft is and I'm jealous that the same isn't true on Apple's platforms (and likely will never be),' Viticci added.\n\nHis idea makes use of Open AI's developer API, which comes at a small cost and is why anyone wanting to use the hack must have access to the pay-as-you-go billing.\n\nIt can be used with either the existing ChatGPT 3.5 model, or ChatGPT 4 if a user has access to it.\n\nThe shortcut allows people to ask questions and follow-up responses in the same 'session', much like on a computer, while it also retains previous conversations and lets a user look at each conversation they've had as a single transcript.\n\n'I genuinely think that S-GPT is, from a technical perspective, my best and most advanced work to date,' Viticci said.\n\n'The ability to hold a back-and-forth conversation brings some terrific advantages over using, say, Siri for certain tasks.\n\n'Unlike other shortcuts for ChatGPT, your conversations are only ever sent to the OpenAI API: by default, the shortcut does keep a log or cache of your chats unless you manually ask it to export a transcript.'\n\nThe shortcut essentially lets you ask ChatGPT questions from an input box on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, with answers then returned by ChatGPT and displayed in an alert on your device\n\nHe added: 'S-GPT was designed to provide users with concise and clear answers that can be read in just a few seconds.\n\n'I did this because S-GPT can be used both as a shortcut launched from the Shortcuts app, an icon on the Home Screen, or a widget, or as a shortcut running inside Siri.'\n\nOne example of how S-GPT can be used is to make a playlist with certain artists.\n\nA user just has to give it a command, which is interpeted by ChatGPT and then passed back to S-GPT for the playlist to be named.\n\nOnce this is done, the playlist will appear in the Apple Music App.\n\nMailOnline looks at five functions that ChatGPT is unable to perform, from playing the popular online game Wordle to remembering its own name.\n\nIt also cannot give advice on prescription medicines or write accurate news articles -- although some supporters say it is only amount of time until it can do the latter.\n\nLimitations: ChatGPT has proved enormously popular since its launch at the end of last year.

"'Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary wants to lower gas prices by building a $14 billion oil refinery Kevin O\'Leary wants to lower US gas prices – and he\'s planning to do that by building a $14 billion oil refinery, the ""Shark Tank"" star said in a recent interview with Fox Business.\n\n""We haven\'t built a refinery in America in decades because we can\'t permit it … And the task I\'ve decided I\'m going to take on is I\'m going to build a refinery in America,"" O\'Leary said on Tuesday. He briefly detailed plans to finance the refinery, estimating the costs to clock in around $14 billion.\n\nO\'Leary emphasized the importance of US energy independence, calling it a top election issue. He pointed to OPEC , the 13-nation oil cartel that recently announced a surprise production cut of over 1 million barrels of crude a day.\n\n""The Middle East, which produces most of the world\'s oil, has told every economy including ours, do not depend on us in perpetuity for your energy. If you can find your way to energy independence, you do it and in fact, we\'ll invest in it for you because we have to supply energy to the entire world,"" O\'Leary said.\n\nThat cartel had repeatedly slashed its crude production over the last year, exacerbating supply shortages and sending US gas prices to a new record in 2022. The production cuts were needed to control ""dysfunction"" in energy markets, top OPEC-producer Saudi Arabia said, claiming that oil prices were disconnected from fundamentals.\n\nSome observers have been concerned that the latest production cut could send prices even higher, with oil prices immediately jumping 6% in the days after the cut was first announced. OPEC could also issue more production cuts later on in the year and spur a rally in oil prices in the second half, RBC\'s Helima Croft said, which is likely to push prices at the pump higher, too.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, traded at $85.65 a barrel on early Wednesday.

It also signifies that he is viewed officially as a political prisoner and not a legitimate detainee of Russia.\n\nThe office\'s special envoy Roger Carstens said the administration was in a ""full-court press"" Wednesday during an interview with CBS News.\n\n""Senior members of the U.S. government, including Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, have met with their counterparts in Russia to try to press them to release Evan and to gain more information,"" he said.

So just know: All things are possible in America.""\n\nIn recent months, Scott has shown other signs of being interested in the presidency, including launching a listening tour called ""Faith in America"" and going to early primary voting states New Hampshire and Iowa.\n\nHe also released a memoir, ""America, a Redemption Story: Choosing Hope, Creating Unity."" Even though he defended a safe seat last cycle, he is one of the top fundraisers in the Senate -- which includes support from small and online donors. He has nearly $22 million left in a campaign account, which he can use for a White House run.\n\nScott was among those leading the push for the successful passage of the criminal justice law, the bipartisan First Step Act, and his measure to create Opportunity Zones that bring private investments into economically distressed communities was part of the 2017 tax reform law.\n\nAfter delivering the GOP response to Biden\'s address to Congress last year, he garnered national interest, after which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky named him ""the future of the Republican Party.""\n\nScott served a term in the US House before joining the Senate. Haley, who was South Carolina governor at the time, appointed Scott to the seat in 2013 after then-Sen. Jim DeMint resigned.\n\nScott has been open about the racism he has faced over the course of his life and about growing up in poverty in the South.\n\n""I get called Uncle Tom and the n-word by progressives, by liberals,"" he said in response to Biden\'s address. He has shared in interviews that police have pulled him over numerous times, despite him not violating any traffic laws. He sat down with Trump at the White House to discuss systemic racism and publicly called on Trump to call back certain statements he made on race.\n\nIn his exploratory committee video, Scott promised to defend ""conservative values that make America exceptional,"" referring to policies such as school vouchers that move students out of public schools and restrictions on abortion rights and illegal immigration. ""If the radical left gets their way millions more families will be trapped in failing schools, crime-ridden neighborhoods, and crushing inflation,"" he said in his exploratory committee video.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee criticized Scott\'s announcement on Wednesday, calling him a ""fierce advocate of the MAGA agenda."" Other candidates expected to launch a bid for the 2024 nomination include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nUpdated, April 12, 10:00 AM ET -- This article has been updated to include comment from the Democratic National Committee. https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-scott-campiagn-president-2024-exploratory-committee-2023-4"
"Russia accused of beheading Ukrainian soldier: 'How easily these beasts kill,' Zelenskyy says Ukraine accused Russia of executing its servicemen after videos purporting to show the beheading of Ukrainian soldiers began circulating online.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday responded to one of the videos, saying that it showed ""the execution of a Ukrainian captive.""\n\n""There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that Russia is trying to make ""destroying life"" into the ""new norm.""\n\nThe video, which has not been verified, shows what appears to be a Russian soldier using a knife to behead a man wearing Ukrainian military clothing.\n\nGiven the amount of foliage on the ground, it was likely filmed during the summer, CNN reported.\n\nDmytro Kuleba, Ukraine\'s foreign minister, described it as a ""horrific video of Russian troops decapitating a Ukrainian prisoner of war.""\n\nKuleba accused Russia of being ""worse than ISIS"" and said that ""Russian terrorists must be kicked out of Ukraine and the UN and be held accountable for their crimes.""\n\nThe Islamic State previously released videos of it beheading captives.\n\nAnother video shared by a pro-Russia Telegram channel last week also appeared to show Ukrainian soldiers lying dead with their heads cut off, CNN reported.\n\nWhile the video was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group, according to CNN, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin denied the claim on his company\'s Telegram account.\n\n""I watched this video. It\'s bad when people\'s heads are cut off, but I haven\'t found anywhere that this is happening near Bakhmut and that Wagner PMC fighters are participating in the execution,"" he said.\n\nRussia has not commented on the videos, but has previously denied that any of its servicemen have committed atrocities or war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nSeemingly responding to the first video, Zelenskyy said the apparent killing was ""not an accident"" but instead part of a pattern by Russia, pointing to alleged war crimes in the town of Bucha.\n\nWhen Russia pulled back from the Kyiv suburb last year, investigators found bodies with their hands tied behind backs and gunshot wounds to their heads.\n\nInvestigators said that there was evidence to show that Russian forces ""carried out targeted, organized killings of civilians in Bucha.""\n\nDariia Zarivna, an adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said on Telegram on Wednesday that the videos were ""aimed at intimidation"" and showed ""the essence of a terrorist country,"" according to CNN\'s translation.\n\n""The target audience is not only Ukraine, but also Western societies,"" she added. ""It doesn\'t work on us, though. The Russians are afraid of this, but not us.""\n\nUkraine\'s Security Service announced on Wednesday that it was opening a pre-trial war crimes investigation.\n\n""We will find these non-humans.

"GeForce RTX 4070 GPU Review: It Hits the Bull's-Eye of the Middle     - CNET Nvidia's latest throwdown in the GPU arena, the GeForce RTX 4070 seems like the most well-rounded meat-and-potatoes gaming card choice you can get -- at least for the moment. It's a first-rate option for upgrading to high-speed, highest quality 1080p through entry 4K gaming, hitting all of 1440p in between. Covering that much ground means you should be safe for a few years until you're ready to upgrade again. It's good for 4K video editing, most streaming and entry-level pro and AI-assisted graphics. The size and power requirements make it a good fit for midsize systems. And starting at $600, it's the least expensive way to hit all those targets.\n\nThe step-up RTX 4070 Ti outperforms it, sometimes by quite a bit, thanks to its faster GPU clock and more cores across the board, which makes the 4070 Ti a tempting competitor for the same gaming performance classes as the RTX 4070. But it's at least $200 more (although who knows what the 4070's price range will settle at once the third-party boards start to ship on April 13), recommends a class higher of power supply and takes up more space. Though the 4070 Ti only needs a half-slot more width, that means it will block an entire second slot on many motherboards, and it might not even fit in some smaller systems.\n\nAMD's RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX also outperform the RTX 4070, but they're even more expensive than the RTX 4070 Ti and can't keep up with the RTX 4070 for ray tracing. They're also 2.5 slots thick like the 4070 Ti. And though it sounds tempting to opt for a last-generation GeForce model, they aren't really cheaper unless you drop below an RTX 3070. But at that point you've also dropped down to a different performance class.\n\nThe RTX 4070 FE's power connector.\n\nOne reason to go for an RTX 40-series class card over an older generation is the jump from DLSS 2 to DLSS 3, Nvidia's performance optimization technology, that the newer Ada architecture made over Ampere. DLSS 3 delivers significant gains over its predecessor. The downside is that there aren't a lot of DLSS 3-supporting games out yet -- only about 50, which isn't much out of the universe of thousands of games. But it does bump DLSS 2 performance over the RTX 30-series as well.\n\nIt was a bit odd that Nvidia didn't release a home-grown Founders Edition of the 4070 Ti, but it returned to tradition with the 4070; the Founders Editions are notable for having guaranteed as-launched prices, though they also tend to sell out fast for that reason.\n\nThere's little novel about the RTX 4070 FE's design relative to the rest of the line. The one notable distinction is the power connector, which like the others needs either the bundled adapter or PCIe 5.0 PSU cables/adapters, but only uses a single 12-pin connection (rather than two).\n\nLike its siblings, the RTX 4070 FE has three DisplayPort 1.4 connections and one HDMI 2.1.\n\nCompanies release the highest priced, highest performing model, wait a little while to see how many people snap it up, then release a slightly cheaper, slightly less powerful model, rinse and repeat. And none do it more consistently than Nvidia. That makes offering informed buying advice harder than necessary: We know that slower, cheaper GPU models are coming, but not how much slower or how much cheaper.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there were a 4060 Ti in our future that makes an incremental drop that's worth the performance sacrifice for the price savings, the way the RTX 4070 did subsequent to my review of the RTX 4070 Ti. But for the moment, the GeForce RTX 4070 seems to strike the best balance of performance for the money, and one that should keep you happy for a few years. https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/geforce-rtx-4070-gpu-review-it-hits-the-bulls-eye-of-the-middle/#ftag=CAD590a51e"

"A reporter tried several times to end an interview with Elon Musk, but the Twitter owner ignored him and kept speaking for another 30 minutes Elon Musk ignored a reporter\'s requests to end an interview several times and continued talking for 30 more minutes late Tuesday night.\n\nThe Twitter owner sat down for an impromptu interview with BBC tech correspondent James Clayton and opened up about his takeover of Twitter, laying off employees, working habits and more.\n\nAs the conversation reached the 50 minute mark, Clayton repeatedly tried to wrap up the interview, which was being recorded live on Twitter Spaces, but Musk had other plans. The billionaire instead said he wanted to take questions from around three million users who were following the interview on Twitter, per the BBC.\n\nMusk started joking around with the BBC reporter asking him if he likes the broadcasting organization and slipped in a few innuendos, to which Clayton refused to respond.\n\n""I think we can finish the interview there,"" Clayton then said, but Musk continued laughing and scrolling on his phone looking for more questions.\n\nThe back and forth exchange continued with Clayton saying that he wasn\'t going to respond to any questions and finally: ""I\'m done with this interview.""\n\nClayton then posted on Twitter: ""Ok so usually the interviewee leaves the interview.

"ChatGPT is worth at least $20 per share to Microsoft as it ramps up its monetization efforts of the AI chatbot, Wedbush says Microsoft is poised to benefit from the growing adoption of OpenAI\'s ChatGPT after it made a $10 billion investment in the company earlier this year, according to a recent note from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\n\nIves said ChatGPT will add ""a new layer of growth to the Microsoft story over the coming years"" as the tech-giant integrates the AI chatbot into its Azure cloud and Office 365 offerings. Microsoft recently integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine as it seeks to take market share away from Google.\n\nThe early monetization of ChatGPT across both consumer and enterprise formats is worth at least $20 per share to Microsoft in a sum-of-the-parts valuation, according to Ives.\n\nHe boosted his Microsoft price target to $315 from $290, representing potential upside of 12% from current levels. Ives rates Microsoft at ""Overweight"" and the stock remains on Wedbush\'s Best Ideas List.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella ""is on the offensive strategically at a time when many other tech players are playing defensive mode, which is a positive dynamic for the long term cloud/AI growth of the Microsoft story,"" Ives said, adding that the company is becoming ""the clear leader"" in the AI arms race.\n\nAside from the growing success of ChatGPT, Microsoft is likely to see resilient growth in its Azure cloud platform, according to Ives, who cited internal checks with customers.\n\n""Azure growth stable and most deals green lighted.

"The Ultimate Gold Dilemma: Will $2,000 Be the Launchpad or the Cliff? The $2,000 price level has long been a monumental resistance level for gold, with the precious metal struggling to breach it for more than a few days. With gold recently crossing this critical threshold once again, market watchers and experts in technical analysis are divided on whether it will continue to act as resistance or if the metal will finally break past it for the long haul. The outcome of this dilemma could have significant implications for investors and the broader financial markets.\n\nIn the past, the $2,000 level has proven to be a formidable barrier for gold. The last two times gold approached or crossed this threshold, the metal subsequently retreated, unable to sustain its upward momentum. This resistance was particularly evident in 2011 when gold reached an all-time high of about $1,900 before plummeting in the following years. More recently, gold briefly surpassed $2,000 in August 2020 and again in March 2022, only to retreat soon after both times.\n\nIn recent weeks, gold has once again crossed the $2,000 mark by a significant margin (though it hasn't yet broken its August 2020 all-time high). This renewed push has left many experts pondering whether the precious metal is finally ready to establish a solid foothold above this level, transforming it from resistance into support. If this were to occur, gold could potentially enter a new bullish phase, with $2,000 serving as a foundation for further gains.\n\nFew argue the importance of the $2,000 level in gold's price history. However, opinions among experts in technical analysis about what exactly it means for gold in the future are far from unanimous. Some analysts argue that gold's recent push above $2,000 is a sign of underlying strength and that this time, the metal is poised to maintain its position above the critical level. They point to factors such as ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflation fears and the search for alternative investments as drivers that could support gold's continued ascent.\n\nOn the other hand, some experts remain skeptical, suggesting that the $2,000 level could once again prove to be a stumbling block for gold. Many, like DailyFX's analyst Warren Venketas, believe that an initial move higher is in the cards but suspect that a pullback below $2,000 may come before the end of Q2. These analysts highlight worsening technical indicators such as gold's relative strength index (RSI) and the historical precedent of $2,000 acting as resistance.\n\nWith gold once again crossing the $2,000 mark, investors are left to grapple with the ultimate dilemma -- will this price point serve as a launchpad for further gains or will it prove to be a cliff from which gold tumbles? Or will it trade sideways for months before making any major moves? Even the experts remain divided on the outcome, especially for the medium and long term. Far too many possible eventualities -- economic and geopolitical -- could radically change gold's outlook in the coming months and years. It's essential for investors to closely monitor the situation and consider the potential risks and rewards associated with this pivotal inflection point in the gold market.\n\nInvestors are turning to gold and silver in droves to protect their portfolios as uncertainty rises in the economy.

"Why small dogs like Chihuahuas live LONGER than big breeds like Great Danes, according to science Our furry friends come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, from the tiny, handbag sized Chihuahuas, to the house-trained horses that are Great Danes.\n\nSadly, it is fairly common knowledge that the life expectancies of the larger breeds tend to be much shorter than smaller ones.\n\nMany different explanations have been put forward for this, but scientists from the University of Adelaide think they have finally found the real answer.\n\nAfter analysing the common causes of death in 164 dog breeds of varying size, they found that larger animals are more susceptible to cancer.\n\nThey say this is because natural canine cancer defences have not been able to keep up with the selective breeding of giant dogs.\n\nScientists from the University of Adelaide think that larger dog breeds have shorter life expediencies because they are more susceptible to cancer at a younger age (stock image)\n\n'When we analysed these data sets, we discovered that larger dogs were more likely to die from cancer at a younger age when compared with smaller dogs,' said study author Dr Jack da Silva.\n\nAfter studying the common causes of death in 164 dog breeds, the researchers found that larger dogs are more likely to die from cancer at a young age.\n\nThey say this is because, over time, humans have selectively bred dogs to be as big as possible so they could guard livestock or hunt large game.\n\nFurthermore, many of these breeds are now popular as pets because they appear impressive, majestic and intimidating.\n\nBut, as a result, dog breeds have evolved to be extreme sizes much faster than natural evolution would permit.\n\nThis has meant that their bodies' cancer defences have not had the chance to evolve in proportion to their size, so giant breeds are more susceptible to the disease.\n\n'Larger dogs didn't necessarily age faster than the smaller breeds, but the research did show that as the breed's average body weight increased, so did the rates of cancer.\n\n'We believe the relationship between a dog's body size and their lifespan may be caused by an evolutionary lag in the body's cancer defences, which are unable to keep up with the rapid and recent selective breeding of bigger dogs.'\n\nA Yorkshire Terrier, which can grow to a maximum of seven pounds (3.17 kg), can live for up to 16 years.\n\nBut an English Mastiff, a gentle giant that can weigh a massive 250 pounds (113 kg), only tends to live for between six and ten years.\n\nFor their study, published in The American Naturalist, the researchers wanted to find out why there is such a huge and consistent difference in lifespans of large and small dog breeds.\n\nThey analysed published data on the lifespans and causes of death of different breeds from around the world.\n\nPrevious studies put the shorter life expectancy of bigger dogs down to the higher metabolic rate and their increased risk of certain health conditions.\n\nSome also said that their body size causes them to age more quickly than smaller dogs.\n\nHowever, the team found this was not the case, and instead revealed that the larger the dog, the more likely it is to die from cancer at a young age.\n\nFor their study, the researchers wanted to find out why there is such a huge and consistent difference in lifespans of large and small dog breeds (stock image)\n\nTwo-year-old Pearl (pictured) measures just five inches in length (12.7 cm) - less than a £20 note - and weighs 1.22 lb (553 g)\n\nThey say this is because, over time, humans have selectively bred dogs to be as big as possible so they could guard livestock or hunt large game.\n\nFurthermore, many of these breeds are now popular as pets because they appear impressive, majestic and intimidating.\n\nBut, as a result, dog breeds have evolved to be extreme sizes much faster than natural evolution would permit.\n\nThis has meant that their bodies' cancer defences have not had the chance to evolve in proportion to their size, so giant breeds are more susceptible to the disease.\n\nThe conclusion is consistent with a theory of ageing known as 'life history optimisation' or the 'disposable soma.'\n\n'This theory is based on the idea that if you invest most of your resources and energy into growth and reproduction, you can't also invest them in cell repair and cancer defences,' said Dr da Silva.\n\n'In all organisms, the focus is on reproducing early, even if it comes at the expense of maintaining and repairing the body and living longer.'\n\nWhile this is sad news for big dog lovers, Dr da Silva is optimistic that large breeds will eventually develop cancer defences that match their smaller counterparts.\n\n'This may occur naturally or through selective breeding, as people focus on breeding larger dogs that have lower cancer rates and thus greater longevity,' he said.\n\n'Most of the 400 or so dog breeds we know today have only been established in the past 200 years.\n\n'Larger dogs haven't had time to evolve better cancer defence mechanisms to match their size.\n\n'This could still happen, but it may come at a cost to reproduction.'\n\nThis is due to the life history optimisation theory, as the larger energy investment in cancer defences will mean they have less available to produce large litters.\n\nThe researchers hope that their findings could eventually benefit human health as well as dogs.\n\nDr da Silva concluded: 'Dogs represent a good model for studying ageing in humans.\n\n'Dogs, like humans in the industrialised world, live in an environment that tends to protect them from accidental and infectious causes of death and are thus more likely to die from age-related diseases, such as cancer.'\n\nIf you're afraid of dogs, you may find yourself wary around large pooches such as Dobermans or Great Danes.\n\nBut the results of a new study could refocus your attention away from these breeds, and towards smaller pups.\n\nResearchers from the University of Sao Paulo have revealed that heavier dogs tend to be more obedient than lighter pets.\n\nIn contrast, small, short-snouted breeds such as Pugs, Bulldogs and Shih Tzus are the most badly-behaved breeds, according to the study. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11964473/Why-small-dogs-like-Chihuahuas-live-LONGER-big-breeds-like-Great-Danes-according-science.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

"'Love Is Blind' Dethroned In Netflix's Top 10 List By A New Show Everyone\'s favorite column is back, a couple days later because Netflix\'s Top 10 list has already been shuffled around once again. Just a few days ago, Love is Blind dethroned Netflix\'s mega-hit The Night Agent to become #1 on the service, but with just a few new episodes added, most people moved on pretty quickly.\n\nBut it was not The Night Agent that went back on top, rather, it was the show I\'ve been recommended to everyone and anyone, Beef, which has now hit #1 on the service, which is really heartening to see, given that it\'s the best thing Netflix has put out for a while with Emmy-worthy performances from Steven Yeun and Ali Wong. Performances that will assuredly not get Emmys after last night\'s episode of Succession, but whatever, they\'re still really good.\n\nBeef is one show that I\'m not even sure needs to perform well given that I\'m still not clear on whether those involved want a second season or not. It doesn\'t seem to be listed as a miniseries, but if you watched it, I think it\'s pretty clear that it definitely could end after this current season and be its own, standalone, extremely good show. But we\'ll see what the plan is.\n\nThe Night Agent was a blockbuster for Netflix and got essentially an instant greenlight for season 2, a rarity on Netflix. Love is Blind will absolutely be back on top in a few more days once new episodes air because that batch will have most of the weddings in it where viewers will figure out who said yes and who runs away at the altar.\n\nTransatlantic with Gillian Jacobs is holding strong at #4, where it\'s mainly been planted since release. Hoarders is moving up the list, and some licensed series called Hatfields and McCoys that I have genuinely never heard of before is #5. Rob Lowe\'s Unstable doesn\'t seem to have done all that well, sliding down the list, currently at #7. Shadow and Bone is hanging on for dear life inside the top 10 list at #9, and there\'s probably just a few more weeks until we hear whether it\'s renewed or cancelled. I predict a huge outcry if Netflix kills it before it can get through one more book of source material.\n\nBut yes, like a lot of people, I very much believe you should be watching Beef, probably the best thing Netflix has put out this year. Again it\'s list placement may not matter, but I\'m happy to see it getting viewership all the same.\n\nUpdate (4/12): I am happy to report that Beef is still #1 on Netflix a few days later, and word of mouth continues to be elevating it. It is quite literally one of Netflix\'s best-reviewed shows of the year, and I am curious if it can ramp up the viewing hours to match.\n\nSince I wrote this, a few things have happened, including interviews with the show\'s creator where he talks about A) wanting Amy and Danny\'s story to end here, as this was meant to be a self-contained tale, but B) also leaving the door open for the series as an anthology which covers different ""beefs"" with new characters. So yes, it does sound like he\'s looking for a season 2, even if sadly won\'t contain Ali Wong and Steven Yeun again.\n\nAlso, that declaration that the show is an anthology, may open some doors at the Emmys. Reportedly Netflix is going to be submitting Beef in the Best Limited Series category, meaning it does not have to have Wong or Yeun go up against the monster that will be the Succession cast being nominated (and likely winning) in essentially every acting category there is. I would love to see either actor, or both of them, win in the next Emmys, but we\'ll have to see who else is in the running. And of course, I want to see Yeun win his Oscar some day after his Minari nomination.\n\nI would expect Netflix to end up renewing Beef given its relatively low cost and how well it\'s being received, but Netflix is often far from logical, so we\'re going to have to see.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

"Fox News Will Host The First 2024 Republican Primary Debate In August NORTH CHARLESTON, SC - JANUARY 14: Republican presidential candidates (L-R) Ohio Governor John ... [ ] Kasich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Ben Carson and Jeb Bush participate in the Fox Business Network Republican presidential debate at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center on January 14, 2016 in North Charleston, South Carolina. The sixth Republican debate is held in two parts, one main debate for the top seven candidates, and another for three other candidates lower in the current polls. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe first debate among the 2024 Republican presidential candidates will be hosted by Fox News in August, said RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in an interview on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning. The debate will be held in Milwaukee, to coincide with the Republican National Committee\'s summer meetings in the city, but a specific time and date have not yet been announced. Milwaukee is also set to host the Republican National Convention in 2024. Moderators for the debate will also be named later.\n\n""We\'re also going to partner with some pretty exciting partners,"" McDaniel said, ""for the first time ever we\'re going to livestream on Rumble,"" the video hosting platform that is popular among conservatives. ""We\'re getting away from Big Tech, YouTube\'s owned by Google GOOG ,"" McDaniel explained.\n\n""This is a big step for our party and country, as Republican leaders we must continue to hold Big Tech accountable for their biases and silencing of conservatives,"" McDaniel said in a statement released by Rumble. ""People deserve a fair, unbiased platform and that\'s exactly what this partnership will provide – an opportunity for voters to watch the next President of the United States on the Republican debate stage on Rumble.""\n\nSo far, the only announced Republican candidates for 2024 are former President Donald Trump, former Ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. The RNC has said it will ask candidates to sign a loyalty pledge, agreeing to support whoever becomes the Republican nominee. Asked earlier this year if he\'d make such an agreement, Donald Trump said there were people he ""wouldn\'t be very happy about endorsing. https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2023/04/12/fox-news-will-host-the-first-2024-republican-primary-debate-in-august/"

"Five Fundamentals For Tech Startups Following Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse Christian Wiklund is the cofounder and CEO at unitQ.\n\nAfter experiencing the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), I have realized that tech startups can leverage this failure into a successful business model during these challenging economic times. As a CEO of a thriving startup, the aftermath of the SVB\'s collapse has made me realize there are simple steps that effective tech leaders can take to help insulate their startups from the next financial crisis.\n\nMove beyond a government rescue strategy. Your company should not rely on a single financial institution. If you have all of your eggs in a single basket and that basket fails, it could bring down your company. You might not be able to make payroll or pay for your rent and services, and you could be wiped out quickly. It\'s important to protect your company\'s assets by spreading your startup\'s wealth across multiple banks. This can also give you more options to seek credit, loans and other banking services.\n\nAdopting a robust positive cash balance can help you and your startup weather economic storms. While easier said than done, concentrate on ways to build profits and reduce bloat, and don\'t forget to comb through your finances to remove waste. This approach, at least in the short term, may help you from having to seek more funding at a time when the terms won\'t be as favorable to you as they have been in the recent past.\n\nRegardless of cash flow, startups are often in pursuit of their next round of funding--and they may need it now despite the recent collapse. That\'s why it\'s important not to overvalue your company, as it may be harder to secure a round of funding if you do. By inflating your valuation, you might lose credibility with investors, especially during a time when they are likely to scrutinize their investments even more than usual in the aftermath of SVB and during these times of high inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nThe term ""pivot"" plays a big role here. Remember that altering course to confront economic headwinds may be prudent in an always-changing startup climate. Effective leaders should ensure that employees also develop this mindset and that they remain receptive to fresh ideas, processes and new business realities that startups promise.\n\nDelivering products and services that customers love and value can help your business succeed. In the wake of SVB\'s collapse (and, for that matter, at any time), improving deliverables and enhancing the customer experience along all touchpoints is bound to increase brand reputation, reduce churn and increase your user base. Also, remember to listen to what your customers are saying. With these customer insights, your organization can work to enhance its products and services.\n\nIn reality, none of this advice is that far-reaching; frankly, it\'s simple and obvious. However, when times are good, we can sometimes forget the basics. Revisiting these fundamentals can be incredibly valuable and can lead to success--even during the most uncertain of economic times.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

"How To Boost Portfolio Income By Double Digits Every Year One hundred dollar bills falling from sky\n\nWorried the economy is teetering on the brink? I don\'t blame you.\n\nRather than running for the hills, let\'s focus on recession-resistant dividend stocks. Big payout growers. We\'re talking 25% to 56% dividend growth (yes, that\'s no typo).\n\nThe safest dividend is the one growing the fastest. Take UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the largest health insurance carrier in the US. Its business is beautifully recession resistant. As a result, UNH is one of the most consistent growth stocks out there. Mark it down for 10%  gains, per year, every year.\n\nGains in what? Every metric that matters. UNH\'s sales soared 13% year-over-year. Profits popped, too. And the company raised its dividend by 14%.\n\nThis is a formula for 15.3% returns per year, every year, holding UNH. Let\'s walk through the math.\n\nUNH yields 1.3% today. On paper, that\'s peanuts and why this stock is overlooked by many vanilla dividend investors.\n\nUNH\'s yield bounces between 1% and 1.5%, for years on end. Which is interesting, because we would think that a company with 677% dividend growth over the last decade would pay more.\n\nWell, it\'s not for a lack of effort on UNH\'s part. These dividend advances are ""absorbed"" by Mr. and Ms. Market. They see the hike and bid up the shares. The current yield never moves because the price, over time, soars! Check out these 20 years\' worth of dividend uplifts that don\'t show up in the current yield. Why? Because the price chases the payout higher!\n\nUNH\'s price is ""in line"" with its payout and rarely falls behind. That\'s fine. In fact, it\'s more than fine--it\'s a formula for 15.3% total returns per year, every year.\n\nWant to make more than 15.3% per year? Then find dividends that are growing even faster than UNH\'s payout.\n\nHere\'s a handful of companies that raised their payouts quite generously this time last year. Raises in the range of 25% to 56%.\n\nIf they can keep it up, shareholders will be showered in riches! If not, well, they\'ll be wishing they bought reliable-old UNH instead!\n\nDividend Yield: 1.2%\n\nProjected Q2 Dividend Announcement: Early May\n\nPool Corp. (POOL) is the world\'s largest distributor of swimming pools, swimming-related products and other outdoor goods, boasting more than 200,000 branded and private-label products throughout nearly 420 sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia. That covers everything from pools and hot tubs to pool pumps and chemicals to barbecue grills and patio lighting.\n\nPOOL was a COVID-era darling, which is probably no surprise to you. Most of us know (or are) someone who dealt with travel restrictions by putting in a pool or hot tub, expanding a deck or installing an outdoor kitchen. That sent POOL shares through the roof--at least for a time.\n\nLike with many COVID winners, Pool Corp. has come back to earth. Which was really just a matter of time--it\'s a great operator that\'s well-managed, but it was caught up in breathless overbuying, and a drawback was inevitable.\n\nSome of my readers might remember that around this same time last year, I openly wondered what kind of dividend increase Pool Corp. (POOL) would deliver in Q2 2022. At the time, I said its ""dividend increase is largely up to whether it\'s a reward for another good year or reflective of a difficult growth path to come."" Investors were rewarded with a massive 25% hike, and the company followed that up with a much better full-year 2022 financial performance than it originally projected (record sales on 17% revenue growth, and 17% EPS growth).\n\nBut in the same report, Pool Corp. anticipated a 12% decline in EPS at the midpoint of its expected range, largely blaming ""challenged"" pool construction levels compared to the past two blowout years. POOL has plenty of room to expand the dividend by expanding its low 20% payout ratio, but I wouldn\'t be surprised at a much more modest payout increase in early May, when it typically announces its annual hike.\n\nParker Hannifin (PH)\n\nDividend Yield: 1.6%\n\nProjected Q2 Dividend Announcement: Late April\n\nParker Hannifin (PH) produces motion and control technologies and systems for a variety of industries, including aerospace, healthcare, energy, chemical processing, industrial equipment, transportation and more. Moreover, its applications for heavy construction equipment, as well as liquids removal for construction sites, prompted me to flag it as an infrastructure-bill winner a couple years ago.\n\nBut what makes Parker even more attractive is a series of acquisitions over the past few years that should increase its percentage of recurring sales, making it less cyclical than your typical industrial stock.\n\nThat\'s good, because PH targets a dividend payout ratio of 30%-35%, so the only way to dividend growth is earnings growth. Indeed, it paused its payout at 88 cents per year during 2020, when COVID held back its business--but raised the dividend by 29% in 2022, amid a fiscal year that saw it grow profits by nearly 25%.\n\nIn turn, that means we might be able to expect more consistent stock growth from PH, which definitely seems to benefit from the dividend magnet.\n\nAs for this year: Parker Hannifin is tracking for a more modest year of single-digit earnings growth. So when it comes time for PH to announce its next dividend hike in late April, it could be a more limited improvement compared to 2022.\n\nDividend Yield: 2.2%\n\nProjected Q2 Dividend Announcement: Late May\n\nBig-box DIY giant Lowe\'s (LOW) is a rarity among Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nTypically, once you break the 25-year threshold it takes to attain dividend aristocracy, it\'s mostly downhill from there--not as a company, of course, but as an aggressive dividend grower. Growth slows, and there\'s only so much of your profits you\'re willing to pay out as dividends.\n\nAnd if you\'re sitting at more than a half-century of uninterrupted payout hikes, like Lowe\'s is? Well, you\'d figure the old boy would be limping into every dividend announcement.\n\nLowe\'s has allowed its dividend to balloon by more than 150% across the past five years, with the lion\'s share of that coming over the past two years.\n\nThe story is much the same as Pool Corp: COVID provided a wonderful (but temporary) boost as Americans upgraded their homes. Profits soared as a result, and Lowe\'s generously shared those profits with shareholders. But now, the company\'s momentum is expected to slow this year--in fact, profits are expected to slide back by 1% or 2%--as the housing market eases. And that could limit Lowe\'s next dividend increase, which should be announced in late May.\n\nI\'m not sour on Lowe\'s, though. While stocks more tightly tied to homebuying and new-home construction could suffer more, the home-improvement market should be more resilient because homes don\'t stop aging, and Americans still have high disposable income to re-invest in their houses.\n\nDividend Yield: 1.1%\n\nProjected Q2 Dividend Announcement: Mid-April\n\nWinmark (WINA) is as inconspicuous a dividend stock as you could ask for. Its sub-2% yield isn\'t drawing any attention, nor is its business, which is as a franchisor of used-goods stores.\n\nWinmark is the name behind a collective 1,300 or so locations of Plato\'s Closet, Once Upon A Child, Play It Again Sports, Style Encore and Music Go Round--a group of retailers that deal in secondhand apparel, sports goods and musical instruments.\n\nBut the business--at least for Winmark--isn\'t retail, but franchising. WINA finds entrepreneurs that want to operate one of its businesses, outline rules of operation, train these franchisees, and sign them up for agreements that can be renewed after 10 years--which, in 2022, 100% of them did. Royalties from these franchisees make up 85% of the business, and franchise fees another 2%.\n\nIt\'s not a red-hot growth business, but it does grow--and that has allowed Winmark to boost its base quarterly payout by an average of 47% annually since 2019.\n\nI stress base, because the quarterly dividend doesn\'t tell the whole story.\n\nWinmark did have a hiccup: It briefly cut its dividend, from 25 cents to 5 cents, for a quarter in 2020. But it not only restored it quickly--the same year, it started what is now a multiyear streak of delivering special payouts, similar to the fixed-and-variable programs of many energy stocks. Even with those special payouts, WINA\'s yield is less than 2% (the regular dividend comes out to less than 1%), so it\'s certainly not a solution for investors who need major current income right this second.\n\nWill Winmark follow up on last year\'s 56% increase with something equally as impressive in mid-April? The odds are low just given the size of the last increase. But given that the regular payout accounts for just 22% of profits, we could still expect a hefty rise.\n\nBrett Owens is chief investment strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

"Diversity In Action: Overcoming The Challenges Faced By Women Veterans And Military Spouses In The Workplace Katherine Webster is founder & CEO of VetsinTech, a nonprofit helping veterans accelerate startup & job opportunities in the tech sector.\n\nWhen it comes to diversity in the workplace, companies often focus on gender, race and ethnicity. However, women veterans and military spouses are also other significant populations that are often overlooked. These populations face unique challenges when transitioning from military to civilian careers.\n\nAccording to recent statistics, only 1 in 4 leave the military with a job lined up, according to Pew Research Center findings. The situation is even more pronounced for women veterans and military spouses, who face additional barriers.\n\nThere are unique challenges women veterans face leaving service or military spouses looking for work. Here are some statistics related to these populations in the workplace:\n\n1. Employment: According to findings from the Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University, in 2019, the post-9/11 women veteran unemployment rate was 4.7% versus 3.5% for male veteran unemployment.\n\n2. Underemployment: Women veterans and military spouses are more likely to be underemployed, meaning they have a job that doesn't utilize their skills or education. Two-thirds of women veterans found their financial transition from the military difficult, compared to 47% of male veterans. And it took three months longer, on average, for women veterans to find civilian employment compared to male veterans.\n\n3. Earnings gap: Women veterans also earn less than their male counterparts. According to 2021 figures from Statista, the median income for women veterans is $40,761 per year, compared to $47,467 for male veterans.\n\n4. Education: According to research published by the U.S. Department of Labor, women veterans have a higher level of education than their male counterparts, with 46% of women veterans having an associate's degree, bachelor's degree or higher compared to 34% of male veterans. It's important to note that military spouses face unique challenges in pursuing higher education due to frequent relocations and other factors associated with military life. Scholarships and online learning programs can help them bring valuable skills and experiences to the workforce.\n\n5. Leadership: Women veterans and military spouses are underrepresented in leadership positions. According to numbers from the Pentagon cited by CNN, women veterans represented 7.1% of the top ranks of the armed forces.\n\nThese statistics underscore the need for continued efforts to support women veterans and military spouses in the workplace, including initiatives to address discrimination and bias, increase education and training opportunities, and promote gender diversity in leadership positions.\n\nThere's a critical need for more inclusive hiring practices, and companies that prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) stand to reap significant benefits. These companies can leverage the unique experiences, perspectives and skills that women veterans and military spouses bring to the table. Diversity can create a more positive work environment, boost creativity and improve the quality of decision-making.\n\nWomen veterans and military spouses typically possess strong leadership skills like adaptability, teamwork and resilience. These populations have been known to show high levels of integrity and accountability and a strong work ethic--all traits that companies seek in their employees. In addition to training, women veterans and military spouses have various technical skills developed during their military service that can be useful in civilian jobs.\n\nDespite the many advantages women veterans and military spouses bring to the workforce, they still face significant obstacles in the job market. These challenges include a lack of recognition of their skills and experience, discrimination and bias, and a lack of support and resources.\n\nA significant problem is a knowledge gap among employers regarding the value and potential these groups may bring to the workplace, frequently leading to them passing up qualified individuals. Discrimination and bias are also prevalent, with many employers viewing women veterans and military spouses as unreliable due to their military obligations. Finally, the lack of resources and support, such as job training and mentorship, can hinder their ability to secure employment.\n\nCompanies can consider implementing some programs to address these challenges:\n\n• Employers can establish outreach and education programs to raise awareness around the benefits of hiring women veterans and military spouses.\n\n• Companies can provide support programs, including training and resources, for these populations.\n\n• Companies can offer DEI training for their HR departments to help eliminate any bias and discrimination in the hiring process.\n\n• Lastly, employers can establish partnerships between the military and private sectors to create job placement programs.\n\nIncentives for companies that commit to hiring women veterans and military spouses, including tax credits and grants, can also encourage more inclusive hiring practices. Creating a supportive community is also essential for providing access to resources, mentorship and networking opportunities. These types of initiatives can help women veterans and military spouses overcome the challenges they face when transitioning to civilian careers.\n\nOur organization has recently designed a new initiative that expands career opportunities for women veterans and military spouses, offering training, mentorship and skills development. Initiatives like this can serve to introduce programs that provide needed support and resources to help women veterans and military spouses build in-demand skills and experience for careers in technology, raising awareness and connecting them with employers committed to DEI initiatives.\n\nIt's encouraging to see a growing number of organizations expand their commitment to supporting women veterans and military spouses. Companies that act to support and hire these unique groups could benefit from their skills and expertise, while demonstrating their commitment to DEI, enhancing the company's reputation, leadership and brand. We encourage more companies to follow suit and take action to attract, hire, retain and promote women veterans and military spouses.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing the challenges faced by women veterans and military spouses in the job market is crucial. Companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion by creating a more inclusive work environment and implementing programs to support these groups stand to benefit significantly. Women veterans and military spouses possess unique skills and experiences that can add value to the workplace, and companies that recognize and embrace this diversity stand to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

"The housing market has now bottomed out, and Americans are buying homes again The US housing market has now bottomed out, and Americans are piling back into the home-buying market once again, according to CoreLogic.\n\nFollowing seven consecutive months of declines, the CoreLogic Home Price Index showed a 0.8% rise in February from January. On an annual basis, home prices in February increased by 4.4%, per CoreLogic data.\n\nTo be sure, there is a regional split in the housing market, with declines in the West and gains in the South and Southeast, Selma Hepp, chief economist for CoreLogic, wrote in a statement last week.\n\n""But while housing market challenges remain, particularly in light of mortgage rate volatility and the ongoing banking turmoil, pent-up homebuyer demand is responding favorably to lower rates in many markets,"" she added.\n\n""This trend holds true even in the West, leading to a solid monthly gain in home prices in February. US home prices rose by 0.8% in February, double the month-over-month increase historically seen and indicating that prices in most markets have already bottomed out.""\n\nFor March, CoreLogic anticipates that home prices will climbed 0.2% month over month, and then for February 2024 the firm expects a year-over-year increase of 3.7%. By comparison, home prices have seen annual gains of 4.6% for roughly three decades.\n\nBut CoreLogic\'s view of the housing market bottom is not a consensus. Both Fannie Mae and Moody\'s Analytics anticipate home prices to dip in 2023.\n\nThe divergent outlooks for home prices follow nine consecutive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve dating back to last year, which has raised borrowing costs and interest rate volatility across the country. Still, the average 30-year fixed rate has fallen to about 6.30% after topping 7% last year.\n\nA New York Fed survey in March found that Americans haven\'t been this gloomy about the year-ahead housing market since 2014. Survey respondents reported they expect home prices to grow 2.6% in the next 12 months. That\'s down from 7% a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, in the apartment sector, demand eased through the first quarter of 2023, according to Moody\'s, and rent prices declined while vacancies ticked higher by the steepest margin in two years. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/housing-market-home-price-bottom-americans-buying-mortgage-rates-interest-2023-4"
"A wide majority of Americans back abortion pills, including 71% of young women. The issue could destroy GOP election chances for a generation. Abortion is quickly becoming an albatross for Republicans, turning a once-reliable way to drive voter turnout into a major problem for the GOP.\n\nA new poll on Tuesday illustrates how a post-Roe v. Wade world is set to dish out more headaches for conservatives. Conducted from March 27 to April 2, the poll comes in the wake of a Texas federal judge's ruling that would suspend FDA approval of one of the two major drugs used to induce an abortion, mifepristone, which can be prescribed in the first ten weeks of pregnancy.\n\nU.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's stayed his ruling on mifepristone for seven days, and the Biden administration moved swiftly to get it overturned.\n\nNonetheless, Kacsmaryk's decision has brought renewed focus to the future of medicated abortions, now the most common method of abortion. According to Pew's poll, only 22% of Americans say that medicated abortions should be illegal in their states, with 53% saying they should be legal and 24% unsure.\n\nThis robust majority is even more substantial among a few specific demographic groups vital to the GOP's future.\n\nAmong younger Americans, large majorities support keeping the practice legal. Pew found that 71% of women aged 18 to 29 and 60% of men in the same age bracket support legality. Among those 30 to 49, 52% of women and 54% of men want abortion pills to remain legal.\n\nThe even more worrying problem for conservatives is that millennials are staying more liberal as they age, a Financial Times study found last year. Unless this trend reverses, abortion rights and other culture war issues could doom GOP candidates in general elections for decades.\n\nWhite evangelicals, a major core of the modern GOP, are the only demographic group Pew found that has a majority supporting making pills illegal. Among that group, 50% would like to see the pills outlawed, and 23% would like them to remain legal.\n\nRepublicans have generally advocated for policies that have restricted abortion access, but Axios noted that many top lawmakers were silent in the wake of Kacsmaryk's ruling. But in recent years, conservatives have moved to restrict access to medicated abortions.\n\nThe bad news for the GOP is that while white evangelicals are major parts of party contests such as the Iowa Republican caucuses, there are not nearly enough of them to make up for the losses elsewhere. In the 2022 midterms, exit polls show Democrats almost ran up a nearly 2-to-1 margin among voters aged 18 to 29, while Republicans held more than a 5-to-1 advantage among white evangelicals. But in the end, Democrats held onto the US Senate, and Republicans retook the House with an extremely thin majority.\n\nTo see the impact of abortion in key swing states, one can only look to early April's contest in Wisconsin. State Supreme Court Justice-elect Janet Protasiewicz won a double-digit victory on a platform that was explicitly built on abortion rights. Protasiewicz flipped a court majority in a state that less than a decade ago had a Republican governor in Scott Walker, who grew so powerful in taking on public sector unions that he was briefly considered a presidential frontrunner.\n\nProtasiewicz ran up the board so much that she nearly won the historically red county of Ozaukee, a suburb of Milwaukee. As for the party base, The Washington Post reported Protasiewicz's campaign produced record-level turnout on Wisconsin college campuses.\n\nIt's not just Wisconsin, either.\n\nThe first signs that midterms would be upended by abortion came in Nebraska and Kansas, the latter of which was the first state to vote on abortion rights after Dobbs. Kansas voters ended up rejecting an amendment that would have eliminated the right to abortion from the state constitution.\n\nBy the end of November, abortion rights advocates went six for six in ballot measures that either enshrined protections into law or stopped further limitations -- an incredible streak that reversed years of losses. https://www.businessinsider.com/abortion-pills-polling-gop-republican-doomed-election-chances-generation-2023-4"
"Here's What's Dropping In Price The Most As Inflation Cools To 22-Month Low Bacon, gas and health insurance are some of the biggest driving factors behind slowing inflation in the U.S., according to Labor Department inflation data released Wednesday morning.\n\nBacon is one of the goods dropping in price in the U.S.\n\nConsumer prices rose 5% in the 12-month period ending in March, cooling to its lowest annualized increase since May 2021 and coming in below economist projections.\n\nDeclining energy prices were the greatest contributor to the inflation slowdown, as energy prices slipped 6.4% as a whole from March 2022 to last month and gas dropped some 17.4% during the period.\n\nConsumers also benefited from a decline in the cost of other everyday goods: bacon prices fell 5.5% during the most recent 12-month period on an unadjusted basis, citrus prices dropped 3.6%, used car prices dwindled 11.2%, smartphone prices slipped 23.9% and health insurance prices sank 10.7%.\n\nOn a monthly basis, eggs (down 10.9%), lettuce (down 5.4%), and tickets to sporting events (down 3.9%) were among the biggest fallers in price.\n\nBut considering inflation remains at a level not seen in several decades before the pandemic, Americans still dealt with soaring prices in major areas, with rent up 8.8% on an annual basis, the cost of food up 8.5%, partially driven by a 13.6% increase in cereal and baked goods prices, and the cost of transportation up 13.9% as airline fares spiked by 17.7%.\n\nInvestors largely cheered on the latest inflation reading, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 gained 0.5% apiece in early trading thanks to optimism the Federal Reserve may loosen its monetary policy as inflation slows.\n\nThe Fed will release minutes from last month's meeting of its policy-setting committee at 2 p.m., possibly revealing what it would need to see from the latest inflation report to support a pause on interest rate hikes.\n\nGas, which skyrocketed in price over the first half of 2022 as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked uncertainty in the global energy market, is again rising in cost, hitting a five-month high last week. The elevated prices at the pump are once again due to geopolitical factors, as OPEC , a powerful group of 20 oil-producing countries including Russia, agreed to cut oil production to drive up prices.\n\nPrices Rose Another 5% In March--Lowest Inflation Reading In Nearly Two Years (Forbes) https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/04/12/heres-whats-dropping-in-price-the-most-as-inflation-cools-to-22-month-low/"
"Bizarre study finds people sensitive to disgusting smells are more likely to be xenophobic Bizarre new research claims that people with a sensitive nose for disgusting smells are more likely to be xenophobic.\n\nIn a study across nine countries, scientists have linked a repulsion to sweat, bad breath and smelly feet with heightened disliking for refugees.\n\nSteering clear of stenches is a natural mechanism that helps us avoid illnesses, experts at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm explain.\n\nBut when working into overdrive, this may trigger hostility towards refugees who are perceived to have 'dissimilar' hygiene and food habits.\n\n'Individuals more easily disgusted by body odours are also more prone to having negative attitudes towards refugees,' the scientists wrote.\n\nDisgust at the smell of faeces, sweat and urine may be linked to xenophobia, a study claims (stock image)\n\nIn a study across nine different countries, scientists examined participant views on refugees. Pictured: newly arrived Somali refugees wait in a line at the profiling and resigtration centre in the Dadaab refugee camp\n\n'As in previous work prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, this relationship was partially explained by the perceived dissimilarity of the outgroup in norms relating to basic practices such as food preparation and hygiene.'\n\nScientists reveal the worst smells they have encountered in the natural world\n\nNearly 7,000 participants took part in the study which examined opinions across the UK, New Zealand, Canada, Nigeria, Kenya, Hong Kong, Chile, Italy and Sweden.\n\nWhen assessing body odour sensitivity, participants were asked to rank scents on a one-to-five scale of perceived disgustingness.\n\nHuman smells like sweat, urine, feet, gas, breath, upper body sweat and faeces were included in the survey.\n\nThese were incorporated into different scenarios such as: 'you are alone at home and notice that your feet smell strongly', and 'you are sitting next to and notice that their feet smell strongly'.\n\nA fictional scenario was then used to assess attitudes towards a fictional group known as the 'Drashnean refugees'.\n\nResearchers posed a situation in which the Drashnean group from Eastern Africa or Eastern Europe had been experiencing a 'great deal of civil unrest in the recent years'.\n\nThey explained: 'As a result of these conditions, many people from this country are trying to leave.\n\n'A large number of these refugees are seeking to immigrate to your country.'\n\nParticipants then answered numerous questions about the group, taking into account food, hygiene and sanitary practices.\n\nOne question asked how much they 'agree that Drashneans could bring health-related problems' into the country, while another looked at potential criminality.\n\nThe results revealed that the participants who scored highly for sensitivity to disgusting smells were more likely to have negative attitudes towards migrants.\n\nExperts claim that their results support 'a theoretical notion of how pathogen avoidance is associated with social attitudes'.\n\nThey said: 'This main finding was observed in a diverse sample from nine countries across the globe and was similar for attitudes toward refugees from Eastern Africa and Eastern Europe.'\n\n'Our results support the theoretical notion that traditional norms provide protection against pathogens and that outgroups are viewed negatively in part because they are viewed as challenging these norms.'\n\nSome of the more conventional treatments for anxiety include psychotherapy, medication and self-help.\n\nBut researchers have now proposed a slightly more gruesome alternative – sniffing someone else's body odour.\n\nThe European experts obtained underarm sweat from volunteers and exposed it to patients while they were undergoing mindfulness therapy for social anxiety.\n\nAnxiety was reduced by more than a third compared with the use of mindfulness therapy on its own, they found – but the reasons why are as yet unclear.\n\nIt's already known that human body odour – commonly known as BO – triggers aggression in women but blocks aggression in men. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11963875/Bizarre-study-finds-people-sensitive-disgusting-smells-likely-xenophobic.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

"Trump's 2024 GOP Competition: Sen. Tim Scott Launches Presidential Exploratory Committee Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) launched a committee to explore a run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination on Wednesday, inching closer to becoming the fourth official Republican challenger to former President Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing ... [ ] on March 28, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump: The former president announced his entry into the race a week after the November election on wounded footing as prominent GOP members blamed him for a string of midterm election losses that left the party with a slimmer-than-expected majority in the House, but he maintains broad support among those who voted for him in previous elections.\n\nMike Pence: The former vice president, while traversing the country to promote his new memoir, So Help Me God, has left open the possibility of a presidential run, and recently made a firm rebuke of his former boss before journalists and politicos at Washington\'s annual Gridiron dinner: ""History will hold Donald Trump accountable for January 6 . . . President Trump was wrong. His reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day,"" he said.\n\nRon DeSantis: Unlike Trump, the midterm election was a boon to the Florida governor, who won a second term by a wide margin and became the first GOP candidate in 20 years to win Miami-Dade County, and while he is unlikely to announce before the Florida legislative session ends in May, he began a multi-state tour in February that looks very much like a precursor to a presidential campaign.\n\nAsa Hutchinson: Hutchinson, who served eight years as governor of Arkansas until the end of last year, launched his campaign in April--Hutchinson has been a vocal critic of Trump, going so far as to say the January 6 Capitol riot ""disqualifies"" him from running again and that he should drop out of the race after being indicted in New York.\n\nTim Scott: The South Carolina senator--who raised speculation that he would enter the race earlier this year when he embarked on a multi-state tour to promote his political message--launched an exploratory committee in mid-April, paired with a video announcement where he vows to ""never back down in defense of the conservative values that make America exceptional.""\n\nChris Christie: The ex-Trump ally turned critic, who is weighing a second run for the GOP nomination after dropping out of the 2016 primary race, told the Washington Examiner in a mid-March interview he will announce a decision on running for president within the ""next 45 to 60 days,"" and will also travel to the early nominating state of New Hampshire on March 27 to speak at Saint Anselm College.\n\nNikki Haley: After vowing not to run against Trump, the former South Carolina governor became his first official challenger in February, calling for a ""new generation of leadership"" in a video announcement, while attacking President Joe Biden\'s ""abysmal record"" and noting that Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight elections, but Haley is polling at a low 3% among potential 2024 GOP presidential candidates, according to a January Morning Consult poll.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Less than a week after Haley announced her campaign, the 37-year-old investment firm manager--who made Forbes\' list of America\'s richest entrepreneurs under 40 in 2016 with a net worth of $600 million at the time--entered the fray with a video announcement in which he dubs ""covidism, climatism and gender ideology"" as ""new secular religions,"" a statement that builds on what he calls an ""anti-woke"" message detailed in his 2021 book, ""Woke, Inc.""\n\nMike Pompeo: Also out with a new book titled Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love, the former secretary of state told CBS in January he would decide on a 2024 presidential bid in ""the next handful of months.""\n\nChris Sununu: The New Hampshire governor raised the prospects of a possible 2024 run on Sunday, telling CBS News\' Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan on Sunday that it would be ""an opportunity to change things,"" after recently taking steps to solidify his political future with the launching of a new super-PAC.\n\nGlenn Youngkin: He raised his national profile campaigning for GOP candidates during the 2022 midterm election, but the Virginia governor has remained noncommittal on a run for president, telling NBC News in January he is ""humbled"" by talk of a potential candidacy and remains ""so focused"" on his current role.\n\n49%. That\'s the percentage of GOP voters who said they would cast their ballots for Trump in a hypothetical 2024 primary, compared to 26.2% who said they would vote for DeSantis, according to FiveThirtyEight\'s poll tracker.\n\nConfirmed and potential contenders began to ramp up their political activity in February. Pence and DeSantis both spoke at the Club for Growth\'s annual gathering of heavyweight donors in early March, while Trump was snubbed from the event over a feud with the club that began during the 2022 primaries. He instead headlined the Conservative Political Action Conference, which Pence and DeSantis did not attend. Trump and DeSantis visited Iowa within days of each other in early March and are expected to accelerate their cross-country travels in the coming months. DeSantis, who had largely shied away from criticizing Trump, gave his strongest rebuke to date of the former president in a March interview with Piers Morgan, where he criticized Trump for not firing former White House medical advisor Anthony Fauci, who has been demonized by the right for his Covid-19 policy recommendations. Trump has also criticized DeSantis for his Covid-19 shutdown policies, along with his previous support for Medicare and Social Security reforms, using the nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" to refer to his former protege. DeSantis fired back at the nickname in his interview with Morgan, where he said ""call me whatever you want, just as long as you also call me a winner because that\'s what we\'ve been able to do in Florida.""\n\nThe outcome of five ongoing law enforcement investigations against Trump and whether they will affect his standing as a candidate. Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan criminal court on April 4 in connection with a broad hush-money scheme prosecutors said he orchestrated to cover up three affair allegations. Separately, the New York Attorney General is investigating his family business practices. The Justice Department has two ongoing probes into Trump\'s role in the January 6 insurrection, along with his handling of classified documents he took to Mar-A-Lago after leaving office. The Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney\'s office is also investigating Trump\'s role in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state.\n\nPence is also facing a Justice Department probe over his handling of classified documents after leaving office. Approximately 13 documents with classified markings were discovered by Pence\'s lawyers and FBI agents at his Carmel, Indiana, home in January. The federal government collected more than 300 documents with classified markings in total from Trump after he left office, including more than 100 classified documents turned over to the National Archives in January last year, another batch investigators collected from Mar-A-Lago in June 2023 and the records seized in an FBI raid at Mar-A-Lago on August 8. President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce a re-election bid in the coming months, is also facing a Justice Department investigation into his handling of classified documents after more than two dozen records with classified markings were found in Biden\'s possession between November and January in searches by the FBI and his personal attorneys.\n\nFormer Gov.

"Tim Scott Unveils 2024 White House Exploratory Committee (COLUMBIA, S.C.) -- Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is taking the next official step toward a bid for president in 2024.\n\nIn a video released Wednesday morning, Scott announced he was forming an exploratory committee, which moves him closer to a formal campaign for the White House. He leaned into his biography as a Black man who overcame poverty to argue that Democrats are too liberal and have needlessly divided the country by fostering a ""culture of grievance.""\n\n""All too often when they get called out for their failures, they weaponize race to divide us, to hold onto their power,"" he said. ""When I fought back against their liberal agenda, they called me a prop. A token. Because I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control.""\n\nIf he enters the field, Scott will join another South Carolinian, former Gov. Nikki Haley, as well as former President Donald Trump, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and ""anti-woke"" biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Others, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence, are considering launching campaigns in the coming months.\n\nRead More: Who Has Announced They\'re Running for President in 2024?\n\nScott, the only Black Republican senator, would be the nation\'s first Black Republican president if elected. During a Wednesday morning interview on Fox News, Scott repeated some of the messaging from his video, also noting that, on his recent ""listening tour"" through early-voting states, he had heard from voters ""starving for a positive, optimistic vision that is anchored in American values.""\n\nAsked if his personal biography and positive message was his strongest weapon against Trump, who has been leading the Republican field in polling, Scott responded that ""the field of play is focused in on President Biden\'s failures.""\n\nFor months, Scott has been developing the infrastructure to accompany a bid for the White House, building out his political action committee and visiting early voting states. On Wednesday, he\'s traveling to Iowa, the state that will kick off the Republican nomination contest early next year. He\'ll also swing through the early voting state of New Hampshire this week before heading back to South Carolina for ""breakfast, policy discussions, and political update"" with donors.\n\nThose donors could become key to an exploratory committee, which gives Scott the ability to raise money directly for a possible bid, cash that can fund polling and travel.\n\nScott has already shown the ability to attract significant money. Opportunity Matters Fund, a pro-Scott super political action committee, spent more than $20 million to help Republicans in 2022, reporting $13 million-plus on hand to start 2023. Tech billionaire Larry Ellison has donated at least $30 million to the organization since 2021, according to federal filings.\n\nHe has signaled how he might distinguish himself from the others in the race by leaning into a more hopeful message than the grievance-based politics advocated by others.\n\nDuring a February visit to Iowa, which holds the first GOP presidential caucuses, Scott spoke of a ""new American sunrise"" rooted in collaboration.\n\n""I see a future where common sense has rebuilt common ground, where we\'ve created real unity, not by compromising away our conservatism, but by winning converts to our conservatism,"" he said.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com. https://time.com/6270897/tim-scott-committee-2024-run/"
"Analyzing Snap-On's Dividend Growth Potential Businessmen pointing to arrows and business growth graphs on a modern virtual interface on global ... [ ] network, Banking, Stock market and currency exchange.\n\nOn a price return basis, the Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio (-4.7%) underperformed the S&P 500 ( 0.1%) by 4.8% from February 28, 2023 through March 27, 2023. On a total return basis, the Model Portfolio (-4.5%) underperformed the S&P 500 ( 0.4%) by 4.9% over the same time. The best performing stock was up 5%. Overall, nine out of 30 Dividend Growth stocks outperformed their respective benchmarks (S&P 500 and Russell 2000) from February 28, 2023 through March 27, 2023.\n\nThe methodology for this model portfolio mimics an ""All Cap Blend"" style with a focus on dividend growth. Selected stocks earn an attractive or very attractive rating, generate positive free cash flow (FCF) and economic earnings, offer a current dividend yield  1%, and have a 5  year track record of consecutive dividend growth. This model portfolio is designed for investors who are more focused on long-term capital appreciation than current income, but still appreciate the power of dividends, especially growing dividends.\n\nSnap-On (SNA) is the featured stock in March\'s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio. I first made Snap-On a Long Idea in February 2018 and the stock is up 51% while the S&P 500 is up 52% since then.\n\nSnap-On has grown revenue by 5% compounded annually and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 9% compounded annually over the past decade. The company\'s NOPAT margin has increased from 12% in 2012 to 19% in 2022. Even though invested capital turns fell slightly during that period, NOPAT margins increased enough to drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 11% in 2012 to 16% in 2022.\n\nFigure 1: Snap-On\'s Revenue & NOPAT Since 2012\n\nSNA Revenue And NOPAT Since 2012\n\nSnap-On has increased its regular dividend from $3.41/share in 2018 to $5.88/share in 2022, or 15% compounded annually. The current quarterly dividend, when annualized, equals $6.48/share and provides a 2.7% dividend yield.\n\nMore importantly, Snap-On\'s free cash flow (FCF) easily exceeds its regular dividend payments. From 2018 through 2022, Snap-On generated $2.9 billion (22% of current enterprise value) in FCF while paying $1.2 billion in dividends. See Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: Snap-On\'s FCF vs. Regular Dividends Since 2018\n\nSNA FCF vs Dividends Since 2018\n\nCompanies with FCF well above dividend payments provide higher-quality dividend growth opportunities. On the other hand, dividends that exceed FCF cannot be trusted to grow or even be maintained.\n\nAt its current price of $237/share, Snap-On has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.1. This ratio means the market expects Snap-On\'s NOPAT to increase just 10% from 2022 levels over the life of the company. This expectation seems overly pessimistic given that Snap-On has grown NOPAT by 9% compounded annually over the past decade and 12% compounded annually over the past two decades.\n\nEven if Snap-On maintains its 2022 NOPAT margin of 19% and grows revenue by just 4% compounded annually over the next decade, the stock would be worth $285/share today – a 20% upside. In this scenario, Snap-On\'s NOPAT would grow just 4% compounded annually through 2032. Should the company\'s NOPAT grow more in line with historical growth rates, the stock has even more upside.\n\nAdd in Snap-On\'s 2.7% dividend yield and a history of dividend growth, and it\'s clear why this stock is in March\'s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio.\n\nCritical Details Found in Financial Filings by My Firm\'s Robo-Analyst Technology\n\nBelow are specifics on the adjustments I make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Snap-On\'s 10-K:\n\nIncome Statement: I made $134 million in adjustments with a net effect of removing $26 million in non-operating expenses ( 1% of revenue).\n\nBalance Sheet: I made $1.8 billion in adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $168 million. The most notable adjustment was $528 million (9% of reported net assets) in other comprehensive income.\n\nValuation: I made $1.9 billion in adjustments, with a net decrease of $605 million in shareholder value. Apart from total debt, one of the most notable adjustments to shareholder value was $660 million in excess cash.

Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nAlabama inmates could see more time behind bars under a bill approved Tuesday that reduces the use of good behavior incentives to shorten prison stays.\n\nThe Alabama House of Representatives voted 79-24 for the Senate-passed proposal that now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. Supporters said the legislation is needed to rein in the use of generous sentence incentives. But the approval came over concerns of some lawmakers who questioned if it would worsen Alabama\'s ongoing prison crisis by exacerbating the existing overcrowding.\n\nThe legislation is named after slain Bibb County Deputy Brad Johnson. Johnson was killed in 2022 by a man law enforcement officials said was released after serving four years of a 10-year theft sentence, despite escaping from a prison work release center.\n\n""Deputy Brad Johnson was murdered serving his community,"" Republican Rep. Russell Bedsole said. Bedsole who is also a captain and jail commander with the Shelby County sheriff\'s office, said the situation prompted lawmakers to reform the use of the incentives known as ""good time"" credits.\n\nMOTORIST FATALLY SHOT, ALABAMA TROOPER WOUNDED AFTER CAR CHASE SHOOTING\n\nAlabama law allows certain inmates, sentenced to 15 or fewer years, to earn sentence reductions for good behavior. The legislation would reduce the amount of ""good time"" credit inmates can receive and also says inmates who commit certain offenses while in prison, including escape, would be disqualified from early release. Eligible inmates can now earn sentence reductions of 20 to 75 days -- depending upon their classification -- for every 30 days of good behavior. The bill would reduce that to five to 30 days.\n\nWhile the incentives can add up to large sentence reductions, most Alabama inmates are ineligible to receive them because of the length of their sentences. The Alabama Department of Corrections said last month that 2,588 of the prison system\'s 19,852 inmates in custody, or 13%, were qualified to earn correctional incentive time.\n\nAlabama lawmakers passed a bill that will reduce the use of good behavior incentives for prisoners in the state.\n\nAustin Hall, the man accused of killing Johnson and shooting another deputy, had been released early from prison under good time incentives, despite escaping from a work release center in 2019. Some lawmakers said the problem is not the ""good time"" incentives but how Hall\'s release was handled.\n\nALABAMA COUNTY\'S ALLEGED ILLEGAL REDISTRICTING WAS DRAWN LAWFULLY, ATTORNEY SAYS\n\nHall, the suspect in the deputy\'s shooting, could have had his good time credit revoked for the 2019 escape, but he never returned to state custody afterward for a hearing, the Corrections Department said in an email last year. Instead, he was held in local jails and eventually released on bond, according to court records.\n\n""You are going to turn the whole system around because they made a mistake,"" Rep. John Rogers, D-Birmingham, told Bedsole during debate.\n\nBedsole told reporters after the vote that ""there is enough blame to go around"" over Hall\'s release. But he said the situation exposed issues with Alabama\'s law, including how generous the incentives are and that inmates have continued to accrue sentence credits despite bad behavior.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOpponents argued the legislation could worsen Alabama\'s ongoing prison crisis by adding to overcrowding and scaling back the use of a tool that encourages good behavior. The Department of Justice has an ongoing lawsuit against the state over prison conditions.\n\n""We continue in crisis mode in our criminal justice system,"" state Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, said.\n\nDeputy Chris Poole, who was shot in the head while chasing Hall on the same day Johnson was killed, watched from the House viewing gallery as the bill was passed.\n\n""It grateful to see this bill passed and know that Brad Johnson is going to save lives,"" Poole said.\n\nHall has been charged with capital murder for Johnson\'s killing and is being held without bond. https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-lawmakers-approve-bill-reduce-good-behavior-incentives-shorten-prison-stays"
"Is A Weaker Than Expected CPI A Sign Inflation Has Been Tamed? Inflation appears to be slowing. But is it slowing fast enough for the Fed? (Photo by Joe ... [ ] Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nIt's been a very quiet six days for stocks but that could all begin changing today as economic data comes into to focus and then earnings season will kick off Friday. Data on inflation shows consumers continue to pay more for goods, but the rate at which they are paying more has cooled. Tomorrow we'll get March's Producer Price Index (PPI) and a look at production costs. Investors will have little time to digest the economic news before attention shifts to the state of the banking sector.\n\nThis morning's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for March showed a year-over-year increase of 5%, which was slightly below expectations of 5.2%. On a month-over-month basis, prices increased 0.1% which was also slightly below forecasts of 0.2%. That sets the stage for this afternoon's release of minutes from last month's FOMC meeting. It'll be interesting to see what was discussed given the current division amongst members of the Fed.\n\nYesterday, newly appointed Chicago Fed President Austin Goolsbee urged caution with respect to future interest rate increases. In comments delivered to the Economic Club of Chicago, Goolsbee stressed the potential impact of tighter lending conditions in the wake of last month's banking crisis. Many economists have noted the more restrictive lending environment will act as a sort of synthetic rate hike, but one that is more difficult to quantify. Meantime, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams remains more hawkish and suggested on Tuesday the Fed still has more work to do in order to get inflation under control. Heading into this morning's CPI report, markets were assigning a 70% probability of a quarter point rate hike when the Fed meets next month. After the report, those odds were relatively unchanged.\n\nTomorrow, before the open, Delta Airlines will report earnings. While I don't expect it to be a major market event, it will offer a preview as to what to expect from the transportation sector and airlines in particular. Then on Friday, we'll hear from Citigroup C , JP Morgan and Wells Fargo WFC . Those reports will give investors their first look into the effects the banking crisis had on those companies.\n\nFor today, markets have so far reacted favorably to this morning's CPI report. S&P 500 futures are up a little under 1% in premarket, while Nasdaq futures are higher by just just over 1%. It'll be interesting to see what happens here, especially as the S&P 500 approaches 4200. I'm watching to see if markets can break through that resistance level or if they fall like a tree branch through a roof. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long term objectives.\n\ntastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2023/04/12/is-a-weaker-than-expected-cpi-a-sign-inflation-has-been-tamed/"
"Intel Foundry Services (IFS) And Arm Ink Processor IP Deal For Intel 18A Process Node Intel Foundry Services (IFS) and leading semiconductor IP vendor Arm have jointly announced a design technology co-optimization (DTCO) agreement to develop multiple generations of Arm-based processor cores that specifically target the Intel 18A process, which is scheduled to be manufacturing ready in the second half of 2024. (When Intel says, ""manufacturing ready,"" the company means ready for risk production, the term commonly used by other semiconductor foundries.) The initial focus for this collaboration will be mobile SoC designs that require excellent performance with low power consumption, which means that potential customers include all the usual fabless chip-making suspects supplying the high-volume mobile phone market. However, this agreement also allows for design expansion into other markets including automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), data centers, aerospace, and other government applications. Arm has not revealed details of the new and yet-to-be-disclosed processor cores covered by this DTCO agreement. However, Arm\'s CEO Rene Haas describes IFS as ""a critical foundry partner.""\n\nThe Intel 18A process is the fifth announced process in the company\'s plan to introduce five increasingly advanced semiconductor manufacturing process technologies in an astonishingly short five-year span, as shown in the image below. These are all leading-edge process nodes, but the introduction of Intel 18A is the final step in the company\'s plan to reclaim transistor performance-per-watt leadership by 2025. That\'s according to Dr. Anne Kelleher, executive vice president and general manager of Technology Development at Intel Corporation, speaking at the 69th annual International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) Plenary session in December 2022.\n\nIntel plans to introduce five new, leading-edge semiconductor process nodes in five years, ... [ ] culminating in Intel 18A, according to a presentation made by Dr. Anne Kelleher, executive vice president and general manager of Technology Development at Intel Corporation, at the 69th annual International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) Plenary session in December 2022.\n\nIn addition to the timely progression of new process nodes occurring with a one-per-year announcement cadence, as shown above, this DTCO agreement between IFS and Arm is another steppingstone towards building Intel\'s reputation and credibility as a semiconductor foundry. Such a reputation requires many critical elements that includes leading-edge process nodes and a broad IP offering. Both are required to develop cutting-edge SoCs.\n\nThis agreement with Arm broadens the IFS IP portfolio in a significant way. No credible, competitive semiconductor foundry can realistically afford to omit Arm processors, which IFS will offer to its customers through this agreement, in addition to the company\'s existing x86 and RISC-V processor IP.\n\nTo date, Arm customers have shipped more than 250 billion ICs with Arm processor IP, and many of those chips went into mobile phones and other mobile devices, the initial target for the Intel 18A process. This DTCO agreement with Arm effectively quashes any question about IFS\'s ability to deliver a sufficiently broad IP portfolio, which is required if IFS is to become a top-tier semiconductor foundry. It\'s quite unlikely that this will be the last major semiconductor IP announcement that IFS will make on its journey.\n\nIFS is a significant component of Intel\'s IDM (Independent Device Manufacturer) 2.0 strategy, and the venture brings multiple benefits to the company. First, it opens Intel\'s very expensive fabs – existing, under construction, and planned – to fabless semiconductor client companies. Keeping the fabs filled is job #1 for a semiconductor maker, and IFS is one way for Intel to fill its fabs.\n\nSecond, IFS appears to be a central element in Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger\'s plan to reclaim Intel\'s transistor performance-per-watt leadership by 2025. By driving IFS to become competitive with other leading fabs, Gelsinger is forcing Intel to ramp up its process development efforts. Intel has taken a lot of heat for losing this lead to its chief semiconductor manufacturing rival, TSMC, which in turn has allowed Intel rivals AMD and Nvidia to make inroads into Intel\'s market share. Intel 18A is where the company has publicly put its stake in the ground, saying ""this is where we regain our top position.""\n\nThird, IFS helps to establish a credible future semiconductor demand that justifies the massive fab expansion that Intel is currently undertaking. It also helps to provide support for Intel\'s requests for governmental support to build those new fabs in multiple locations around the globe.\n\nFor many, Intel\'s jump into the foundry business may appear to be a recent diversion away from making Intel-branded chips. However, Intel\'s original microprocessor, the Intel 4004, was designed and fabricated as a custom IC for Japanese calculator maker Busicom. At the time, Intel was still developing its first DRAM, the 1103, and was a way for the young company to fill its fab until the DRAM could be launched. For the 4004 microprocessor project, Intel served as both design house and foundry. More recently, in 2013, Altera announced that Intel would build the next generation of Altera FPGAs in a foundry deal. Intel bought Altera two years later. Consequently, Intel has more than half a century of experience as a semiconductor foundry. It simply has not flexed those muscles for a while. Gelsinger is now remediating that situation and building the company\'s foundry capabilities through IFS. https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2023/04/12/intel-foundry-services-ifs-and-arm-ink-processor-ip-deal-for-intel-18a-process-node/"

"'The Mandalorian' Continues Its Quality Rollercoaster Revealing Gideon's Master Plan The Mandalorian has been a bit all over the place this season, and fans have been somewhat disconcerted by recent comments that it\'s moving away from just the story of Din and Grogu and into a wider tale about all Mandalorians, including the notion that ""The Mandalorian"" could be anyone.\n\nThat\'s produced an uneven season led by Bo-Katan instead of Din, but at least this week we had a pretty solid episode. Some avid Star Wars fans are calling it the best episode of the series ever, but while it\'s good, I\'m not sure I\'d go quite that far. Spoilers follow.\n\nWe are now seeing the early stages of the Mandalorians attempting to retake Mandalore, but that comes with inherent problems like giant monsters, buried cities and the fact that it\'s sort of hard to restart a whole civilization with like 300 people total.\n\nBut the biggest problem is that we discover that the Imperials are already there. And finally, we have the fruits of a storyline not connected to existing Star Wars plots overtly. In fact, we get an opening where the recently freed Moff Gideon scoffs at why it\'s taking so long for Grand Admiral Thrawn to return, and also doesn\'t seem to care much for ""Project Necromancer"" which I have to believe is the birth of all the Snoke/Palpatine resurrection stuff from the sequel trilogy.\n\nInstead, we learn that Gideon is doing his own thing, forming a guard of Beskar-wearing Stormtroopers, including a Beskar, Vader-like Mando suit for himself, in order to take on the Mandalorians directly, but also as a basis to rule the rest of the galaxy. He talks about combining tech and practices from cloners, the Jedi and the Mandalorians into an army that could conquer everything. The Beskar armor is one thing, I assume what he was doing with attempting to harvest Grogu force material is some attempt to grant himself those powers artificially, and cloners? I don\'t know, maybe bringing back clone troopers to put in those Beskar suits. Or cloning himself so he can\'t die. I don\'t know, but it seems unrelated to the Palpatine stuff being handled by another Hux.\n\nIt was a good episode which included a Hodor moment from Paz Vizsla as he stays behind to fight Death Troopers, killing loads of them, but ultimately being murdered by what appear to be the precursor to Sith Troopers from the sequel trilogy that Rey and Kylo fought that one time.\n\nI was a little surprised to see Grogu, now wheeling himself around in the corpse of his old IG friend, not attempt to force blast the door open to save Din, who has now been captured by Gideon, and I suspect this may lead to Pedro Pascal\'s one helmet-less scene per season. But we\'ll find out soon enough.\n\nIt was a great, action-packed episode, and I really do like the Moff Gideon turn here, something the show desperately needed right about now. It fits with lore but also manages to be its own thing. Good stuff all around.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

"NYC Will Spend $38,000 Per Pupil Next Year. What Does That Buy? The Citizens Budget Commission reports that the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) will spend $38,000 per public school student next year. But it's not clear all that spending is paying off. Indeed, over the past 20 years, New York City (like the nation) has largely flat-lined on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. And, today, families are fleeing the city's schools at historic rates.\n\nMeanwhile, teachers grumble about their pay, school leaders struggle to find staff, and the city is staring down potential cuts as emergency federal pandemic aid dries up. Calls to do better inevitably entail demands for more funding or else get mired in the system's familiar quagmire of programs, protocols, and positions.\n\nThe Citizens Budget Commission reports that the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) will ... [ ] spend $38,000 per public school student next year.\n\nSo, let's approach things a little differently by asking the kind of simple questions I urge in my new book, The Great School Rethink: Could New York City get more bang for its buck? Can current outlays be spent more purposefully, to better meet the needs of students, families, and educators?\n\nIn that spirit, envision a hypothetical fourth-grade classroom in a typical NYCDOE school and ask how we might design it, given a clean slate. For illustrative convenience, we won't get into things like homeschooling or hybrid options--we'll stick with the familiar schoolhouse.\n\nThe average New York City elementary class is, currently, between 24 and 25 students, but a new law signed by Governor Kathy Hochul will reduce that to 23 in the fall (though the district is struggling to find the requisite teachers and funds). Given that, presume there are 23 students in the class.\n\nSpending $38,000 per student on 23 students yields a total of $874,000. Of that sum, let's start by setting aside 40 percent for district administration, including facilities, maintenance, meals, utilities, transport, testing, compliance, and such. That costs our class $350,000 (and leaves NYCDOE's central administration with roughly $15 billion a year--or more than $15,000 per pupil).\n\nAcross the city's public schools, there is currently one counselor for every 325 students. Let's roughly triple that ratio, to one for every 115 students. Counselors in the city's schools earn a bit under $70,000, on average; let's give them a fifty percent raise to $105,000, yielding a total tab of $130,000 with benefits. Our 23-student class would be responsible for one-fifth of that tab, or $26,000.\n\nTop-end technology, personal laptops, and appropriate support can run as much as $350 per student, or $8,000. Let's add an on-site dedicated IT specialist for our K-5 school (which we'll presume has 690 students). If we figure a $120,000 salary, with benefits bringing the total cost to $150,000, the specialist will run us another $5,000--for a total tech price tag of $13,000.\n\nPencil in two school-wide P.E. teachers, a school-wide music teacher, and a fourth- and fifth-grade fine arts teacher (shared across six classes). If we pay each of these teachers $120,000 (we're offering some massive pay bumps) and commensurate benefits, that's a total cost of $150,000 each. Our class's share of the total cost comes to $40,000.\n\nAdd in the cost of a principal, three assistant principals, a school secretary, a security presence, and special education support. Estimate the campus cost at an even $2 million a year, of which our class will pick up its proportionate tab. That's about $67,000.\n\nWe'll create a dedicated fourth-grade staffer to coordinate parent outreach, assist parents, and provide back-office and secretarial support to three fourth-grade teachers. If pay is $70,000 (yielding a total cost of $90,000, with benefits), that's $30,000 to each fourth-grade classroom.\n\nAnd then there's classroom instructional staff. Let's double the pay of the classroom teacher, to $160,000, at a cost of $200,000 with benefits. Just to be clear: This means that the average fourth-grade teacher would earn that much. And we'll add an aide who earns $70,000 (a bit more than a starting NYCDOE teacher earns today), at a total cost of $90,000. So classroom staff costs another $290,000.\n\nAdd it all up and it comes to $816,000, leaving a bit over $2,500 per student for additional outlays.\n\nObviously, this thought experiment is only that: a thought experiment. Like all such exercises, it has all kinds of limitations. And practically speaking, even if it wanted to, the leadership of the NYCDOE can't simply shrug off existing obligations or contractual constraints.\n\nBut it's useful to see what it could mean for kids and educators if spending were rethought. I suspect that a lot of parents and educators would very much like to see the school system ramp up counseling, enhance its technology, bolster arts instruction, provide parents and teachers with more consistent support, and radically boost teacher pay. The fact that it hasn't is the opportunity cost of business as usual. https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickhess/2023/04/12/nyc-will-spend-38000-per-pupil-next-year-what-does-that-buy/"

"Inflation took a massive plunge in March Inflation massively tumbled, according to March data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nInflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), soared by a 5.0% year-over-year increase in March, less than the year-over-year increase of 6.0% in February. That unadjusted change is below the 5.2% increase forecasted, and was the lowest rate since May 2021, according to BLS.\n\nSeasonally adjusted data shows CPI climbed by 0.1% month-over-month in March. That growth is just under the forecast of 0.2%.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 5.6% year-over-year per data that wasn\'t seasonally adjusted. That\'s the same as the 5.6% forecast. It increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% month-over-month in March, matching the forecast of 0.4%.\n\nThe index for energy saw a big year-over-year drop, declining by 6.4%, per not seasonally adjusted data. Seasonally adjusted data shows this index declined by 3.5% from February to March. That\'s a large month-over-month decline relative to the decline of 0.6% from January to February.\n\nThe change in the food index was flat in March, based on seasonally adjusted figures. That comes after many months of month-over-month increases. The food index leaped by 8.5% from March 2022 to March 2023, per unadjusted data.\n\nLike the food index, the shelter index also soared above 8%. It rose by 8.2% over the last 12 months ending in March. The shelter index also climbed by 0.6% over the month.\n\n""The shelter index was the dominant factor in the monthly increase in the index for all items less food and energy,"" the news release from BLS on Wednesday stated.\n\nMarch isn\'t the first month of cooling inflation. The US has been seeing the year-over-year change in CPI slow down in recent months.\n\n""To feel good about where inflation is headed, we need to see more than just moderation in the rate of both headline and core inflation,"" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com, said before Wednesday\'s data release. ""We also need to see moderation in price pressures across a wide range of categories that are staples of the household budget: shelter, food, electricity, motor vehicle insurance, apparel, and household furnishings and operations.""\n\nThe Fed has continued to fight inflation with interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve announced last month an interest rate hike by 25 basis points.\n\nThis is a developing story.

"Suspect arrested in NYC smoke shop execution caught on tape was out on bail for shooting at cops Graphic surveillance video showed the disturbing moments a suspect opened fire toward a man at point blank range inside a smoke shop in New York City. (Obtained by New York Post)\n\nThe suspect captured on shocking video wearing a jacket with the letters FDNY emblazoned on the back while shooting and killing another man execution-style in a New York City smoke shop was arrested Tuesday. Police say the same man also murdered a 19-year-old just 30 hours prior and was out on bail for allegedly opening fire toward cops two years ago.\n\nMessiah Nantwi, 21, was arrested and charged in the murder of 36-year-old Brandon Brunson in Sunday's brazen Harlem smoke shop slaying, as well as the murder of 19-year-old Jaylen Duncan, who was fatally shot in the head near Madison Avenue and East 132nd Street Saturday afternoon.\n\nNantwi, according to reports, was out on bail for the attempted murder of a police officer after allegedly firing at cops during a graffiti stop in the Bronx in February 2021.\n\nNYC POLICE LAUNCH MANHUNT AFTER 83-YEAR-OLD MAN STABBED TO DEATH IN BROOKLYN APARTMENT\n\nNYPD released images of the suspect after a 36-year-old man was shot in the head inside a smoke shop located at 304 Lenox Ave. in Manhattan. (NYPD)\n\nThree uniformed officers returned fire, riddling the then-18-year-old Nantwi with bullets. He was released in mid-2021 after posting $30,000 of a $300,000 bail set by a Bronx Supreme Court judge, N.Y. Daily News reported. The judge reportedly reduced the bail from the initial $500,000 to appease prosecutors. That case remains pending. NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said Tuesday that Nantwi, a member of the local OTN Goodfellas gang, was arrested while riding a Citi Bike on Lenox Avenue and the 9mm murder weapon was found nearby.\n\nThe NYPD had shared stills taken from surveillance video of the suspect who remained wanted for that homicide as of Monday.\n\nThe caught-on-camera shooting unfolded before 8 p.m. Sunday inside a smoke shop located at 304 Lenox Ave. in East Harlem, Manhattan. Police said the suspect shot a 36-year-old man in the head, causing his death. Graphic surveillance footage obtained by local outlets showed the shop filled with at least eight men and a cashier behind the counter.\n\nThe victim, seen in a tan jacket with a red hoodie underneath, interacts with the cashier. He also seems to have an exchange with the suspect – seen in a black jacket with the FDNY letters in an American flag pattern on the back. As the victim turns to leave and walks away, the suspect draws a gun and fires toward him at point-blank range.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO-AREA SOROS DA DEMANDS JUDGE WHO REJECTED DEAL FOR ALLEGED KILLER BE DISQUALIFIED FROM ALL CASES\n\nNYPD said a suspect has been charged in a Harlem smoke shop shooting.

Seeing the man still moving, the suspect points the gun again straight at his head and fires. The victim is then rendered face down and motionless, and the suspect calmly starts to leave the store.\n\nThe suspect goes back to check the victim's pockets before the video cuts out.\n\nSince New York legalized the sale of marijuana, smoke shops have been a growing concern for residents and officials alike, N.Y.

"The best sous vide machines for 2023 Learning how to cook sous vide (which translates literally to ""under vacuum"" in French) can be intimidating. Not only do you need to have a sous vide machine (aka an immersion circulator), some people will also say you need additional equipment like a vacuum sealer, special plastic bags and more. And while those things do help, they\'re not 100 percent necessary and they shouldn\'t scare you off one of the best and most accurate ways of cooking, especially proteins like meat and fish.\n\nThe hard part, though, is choosing the right device for you, as sous vide machines are relatively recent newcomers to home kitchens. After all, the first immersion circulator priced under $500 went on sale in 2009. Prior to that, these devices were typically only found in high-end restaurants or as playthings for celebrity chefs. So if you want to see which sous vide machine can up your cooking game, take a look at our picks for the best devices you can buy right now.\n\nWhile they might have a fancy name, the main things we look for in a quality sous vide machine are quite straightforward: ease-of-use, reliability and a good design. It should be easy to clean and have clear, no-nonsense controls. It should also have some way of attaching to a tank or pot so it doesn\'t become dislodged during use. And most importantly, it should have a strong heating element and motor that can deliver consistent water temperatures to ensure your food hits the correct level of doneness every time.\n\nIf just want a simple, easy-to-use sous vide machine for cooking meats, eggs or anything else, the Anova Precision Cooker 3.0 is our favorite all-rounder.\n\nAnova is one of the oldest names in the game. I\'ve personally been using one of their older models for almost seven years and it\'s still going strong. However, on the latest version of the Anova Precision Cooker you get a number of handy upgrades like digital touch controls, a longer power cord, a water-resistant IPX7 design and even Wi-Fi connectivity. And with a flow rate of eight liters per minute, it can heat up water faster than less expensive competitors.\n\nBut perhaps the best part is that, thanks to a collaboration with chef J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, the Anova app has one of the largest collections of tried and tested sous vide recipes from any manufacturer. So not only is it easy to use, the Anova Precision Cooker can help you find a ton of tasty dishes to try\n\nAlternatively, if you like Anova\'s devices but want something a bit more compact, consider the Precision Cooker Nano 3.0. Priced at $149, it\'s a bit more expensive than the standard model but you still get all the most important features including dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity, a two-line touchscreen and onboard controls so you don\'t need to ever pair your phone to the Nano if you don\'t want to.\n\nWhile it doesn\'t have a built-in screen, it\'s compact design and magnetic foot makes this Breville machine a great pick for people with smaller kitchens and its 1,100-watt motor makes it more powerful than most of its rivals.\n\nIf you want a more sophisticated immersion circulator, Breville\'s Joule Sous Vide is a great choice. It has a slick, compact design, which is great for people with smaller kitchens, and because its motor is located at the very base of the device, you don\'t need to use as much water to cook. So instead of requiring a huge dedicated tank, you can simply fill a three or four-quart pot with water and go from there. On top of that, because it has a magnetic base, it can clamp to the bottom of a pot without needing a separate clip or stand. It also supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. The one downside is that because it doesn\'t have onboard temperature controls, you need to pair it with your phone and use Breville\'s free companion app every time you want to use it.\n\nWhile it\'s not as fancy as some of its rivals and only supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, the Inkbird sous vide machine is a great and affordable way to dip your toes into the world of cooking with immersion circulators.\n\nFor those who want to try out sous vide cooking without dropping a bunch of money, Inkbird\'s Precision Cooker is a great entry-level choice. While it\'s not quite as powerful or fancy as more expensive rivals, it covers all the bases for just under $90 (and it\'s often on sale for even less). Not only do you get a built-in screen with Wi-Fi connectivity, the Inkbird has a powerful heating element with a 0.1-degree Celsius accuracy. Cooking temps range from 77 degrees Fahrenheit to 210 degrees and with a timer setting that goes up to 99 hours, you can try to recreate some of those super long, multi-day recipes like you\'ve seen on YouTube in your own kitchen. https://www.engadget.com/best-sous-vide-133025288.html?src=rss"
"Jeremy Grantham and Goldman Sachs Have One Thing in Common: They Both Like These 3 Stocks Market watchers are waiting for the day the Fed starts cutting rates, but those hoping such an act will signal the beginning of a bull market are in for a rude awakening. At least, that is the opinion of Jeremy Grantham.\n\nAcross decades of investing, Grantham\'s reputation has been built on predicating market meltdowns, and the legendary investor and GMO co-founder thinks the bear will only be halfway through its wrecking job once the Fed changes it inflation-combating strategy.\n\n""Most of the decline in these great bear markets only happens after the first interest rate cut,"" Grantham recently said. ""So you tell me when the first interest rate cut is, and I will tell you when the second half of the pain is going to start.""\n\nHowever, that doesn\'t mean that Grantham has lost hope for all stocks. His portfolio still includes big bets on several names and he\'s not the only one showing confidence in these equities. Banking giant Goldman Sachs has also been singing the praises of 3 Grantham-owned stocks, believing they are primed to push ahead from here. Let\'s take a closer look.\n\nSolarEdge Technologies (SEDG)\n\nWe\'ll start with SolarEdge Technologies, the biggest supplier of photovoltaic inverters in the world. By creating a device that attaches to the back of the solar panel and increases the amount of power generated, the company essentially became the first to make power optimizers a commercially viable product, helping to reduce the cost of the energy the system creates.\n\nGiven Europe is looking to become less dependent on Russian natural gas, the company is well setup up to cater to increasing demand in the region, which now accounts for nearly 60% of its total solar inverter volume.\n\nSolarEdge is showing strong growth, with its revenue soaring by 61.4% year-over-year to $890.7 million in Q4. This impressive increase was largely fueled by the solar segment\'s record sales of $837 million. Adj. EPS climbed from $1.10 in the same period a year ago to $2.86. Both the top-and bottom-line displays came in ahead of the forecasts. For Q1, revenue is expected to come in between $915 million and $945 million. The Street was looking for just $914.70 million.\n\nGrantham obviously thinks SolarEdge has what it takes to outfox the bear. In Q4, GMO increased its position by 59% and holds a total of 657,660 SEDG shares. These are currently worth $189.6 million.\n\nMirroring Grantham\'s confidence, Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee believes the future is bright for this smart energy leader. He writes: ""SEDG\'s gross margin recovery story is still only in the middle innings with more drivers of upside yet to fully play out (e.g. freight, Sella 2 manufacturing, IRA credits), while the specter of potential upside and leverage to any further European policy support (e.g. IRA) would make SEDG well-positioned to see further upside in numbers, in our view. At the same time, the Euro could prove to be a tailwind again in the near-term.""\n\nThese comments form the basis for Lee\'s Buy rating on SEDG, while his $420 price target suggests the shares will climb 46% higher over the coming months. (To watch Lee\'s track record, click here)\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an additional 14 Buys and 7 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $369.57 average target, investors will pocket returns of 30% a year from now. (See SEDG stock forecast)\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (CRM)\n\nThe next name endorsed by Grantham and Goldman is another leader in its field. Salesforce is a software colossus, specializing in customer relationship management (CRM). Its software and apps provide its client base with the means to offer their own clientele a higher level of service.\n\nThe offerings focus on sales, analytics, and automation to bespoke customer service, community management, and relationship intelligence, amongst others. The company touts itself as the world\'s premier CRM platform for businesses, and with a market cap over $192 billion, that\'s no idle boast.\n\nAfter weathering some tough times like many other mega-tech names, Salesforce\'s fiscal fourth quarter (January quarter) results were impressive. Revenue reached $8.38 billion, for a 14.4% year-over-year increase while beating the Street\'s forecast by $390 million. Adj. EPS also trumped consensus expectations of $1.36, coming in at $1.68. for FQ1, Salesforce guided for revenue in the range between $8.16 – $8.18 Billion, also above the $8.03 billion expected by the analysts. Moreover, via shares repurchases, the company returned $2.3 billion to shareholders.\n\nThat must all be very pleasing to Grantham. GMO\'s stake in Salesforce stands at 1,385,522 shares, currently worth $265.3 million.\n\nFor Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan, when considering this tech giant\'s future, there\'s plenty to be upbeat about.\n\n""We reiterate the company\'s impressive organic growth rate given the company\'s size at  $30bn estimated revenues (GSe) in FY23,"" Rangan said. ""We remain bullish on the company\'s ability to drive continued y/y operating margin expansion beyond FY23. We would point out that companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit and Autodesk which embarked on a journey towards improving OM all benefited from their valuation multiples getting re-rated significantly higher on an EV/Sales basis. We think CRM could join this list especially as the company grows into a formidable $50 billion business in F26/C25, benefiting from a much lower starting point for OM relative to other companies, which on the flip side also offers plenty of room for improvement.""\n\nHow does this translate to investors? Rangan rates CRM shares a Buy, backed by a $320 price target. That figure makes room for 12-month gains of 69%. (To watch Rangan\'s track record, click here)\n\nTurning now to the rest of the Street, where CRM has robust support among Rangan\'s colleagues. Based on 25 Buy ratings, 11 Holds and just 1 Sell, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at $223.21, implying shares will appreciate by 18% over the coming months. (See CRM stock forecast)\n\nCarrier Global (CARR)\n\nLast but not least on our Grantham-Goldman backed list, we have Carrier Global, a company formed way back in 1915 as a specialist in the making and distribution of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems.\n\nWhile Carrier is most famous for its residential and commercial air conditioners, its remit has expanded since its early days and now includes the manufacturing of commercial refrigeration and food service equipment, while the company is also an expert in fire and security technologies.\n\nFor the most part, over the past couple of years, Carrier has managed to beat bottom-line expectations, and while it did not manage to do so in the most recent quarterly update, for 4Q22, at $0.40, adj. EPS still met the analysts\' forecast. Likewise at the top-line; the company might have seen revenue drop by 1% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, but that figure edged ahead of the consensus estimate by $30 million. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, the company guided for sales of $22 billion, also improving on Wall Street\'s $20.39 billion forecast, while adj. EPS is expected in the range between $2.50 and $2.60 – at the mid-point, the same as consensus at $2.55.\n\nJeremy Grantham is clearly upbeat about Carrier. His GMO fund currently owns 1,138,546 shares worth $49.55 million.\n\nWhen assessing Carrier\'s prospects, Goldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie thinks the company is playing it safe with regards to its outlook. He writes, ""Improving price/cost, ongoing cost savings, and continued strength in Commercial HVAC suggest EPS guide is likely conservative, and we remain bullish on the company in the long-term given the self-help opportunity coupled with strong growth tailwinds from education stimulus, healthy building orders, and heat pump demand.""\n\nPutting these words into ratings and numbers, Ritchie says Buy CARR shares while his $53 price target suggests upside of 22% could be in the cards over the coming year. (To watch Ritchie\'s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, CARR gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 9 Buys vs. 4 Holds. The forecast calls for one-year returns of  15%, considering the average target stands at $50.

"Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra is down to $1,000 right now Don't worry if you were put off by the initially high price of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Amazon is running a sale on Samsung's latest flagship phones, and the base S23 Ultra with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is down to $1,000, or $200 off. You'll find a comparable discount for the upgraded version with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, too, and the savings apply regardless of color.\n\nThe 'entry-level' S23 Ultra now costs as much as you'd normally pay for its S23  sibling.\n\nYou don't have to buy the Ultra to find some good bargains. The 512GB Galaxy S23  has dropped to $970 (normally $1,120), while the standard S23 with 256GB is available for $760. Lower-capacity editions are also on sale. The discounts may be very helpful if you're planning to take plenty of springtime photos, or just need extra space for your apps and media.\n\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra is ultimately a refinement of its predecessor, but the improvements are in areas that count -- this remains the best Android phone you can buy. The 200MP main sensor allows for exceptional detail in some scenarios, and there are upgrades to selfies and video recording. The customized Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip is speedier, and the battery life is strong enough to last all day even in heavy use. While $1,000 still isn't trivial, you're getting a lot for your money.\n\nThe Galaxy S23  and S23 are subtler updates, but that still makes them fine choices if you're replacing a years-old phone. They boast improved battery life and tangibly faster performance than their predecessors. They just don't offer major camera upgrades -- the Ultra and rivals like the Pixel 7 series are better at low-light photography, for instance. If you're just looking for Samsung's fastest hardware at the lowest possible price, you'll be happy.\n\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice. https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-s23-ultra-is-down-to-1000-right-now-133014062.html?src=rss"

"Series: Consolidation, Fewer Rules, And Direct Cash Will End The Housing Crisis It\'s a big lift, but if federal programs could be consolidated, local regulations reduced, and more ... [ ] cash rental assistance given, the country\'s housing problems would fade.\n\nThe last two posts laid out two basic points, that housing is a commodity not a right and that housing inflation, not greed, is the common enemy of people who have less money and those who want to provide housing for people under any business model. Housing is a consumer product, and if we want it to be affordable for people who go to work every day, no matter how much money they earn, we need to accept these basic facts. If we did, there are three steps we need to take, first, the consolidation of all federal programs, second, conditioning the receipt of those funds only for jurisdictions that abolish zoning and local restrictions on housing production, and third using subsidies primarily for cash payments and building for the lowest levels of income. Here\'s three big steps we should take as a country.\n\nI. Consolidate all federal housing programs\n\nIn writing my series on almost 20 federal housing programs that started back in February, I discovered that the federal government spends somewhere between $20 billion and $30 billion dollars on housing subsidies. This money gets pushed out through an accretion of complex formulas and regulations in the form of tax credits, vouchers, and a myriad of other programs and projects. I\'ve described the money going out for housing as a broken fire hydrant, but instead of water, spewing cash all over the street and sidewalk. All that money is being scooped up by people with tin cups, jugs, wheelbarrows, and in some cases tanker trucks. The money reaches some individuals through a voucher but most is soaked up by governments and organizations.\n\nYes, some housing thirst is slaked, but very inefficiently and unevenly. The series gives many examples of the inefficiency in the system. The biggest problem is the fact that the existing business model of most housing organizations and advocacy groups is based on assembling capital to build and operate housing. This is driven mostly by ideology, not by economics. The idea is that the government is the best and most honest and accountable party to allocate housing to the poor. But the record speaks for itself: after decades of spending recklessly on housing all that money hasn\'t created a state of affairs in which poor people can reliably count on housing no matter what else happens in their lives.\n\nThe fact that some people were housed through this profligate spending and none would have been had the money gusher not been flowing does not counter the argument that had all that money been spent more efficiently even more people would have been housed. More importantly, the reasons why price shocks and shifts happen isn\'t because there isn\'t enough money flowing, but because the country has handed housing policy to the functional equivalent of thousands of Harper Valley PTAs, local governments, that simply don\'t have the capacity or discipline to stay out of the way of producers and consumers. If local governments regulated over the counter pain killers, a capsule of Tylenol would cost $300, and they\'d declare a ""crisis"" and ask the federal government for money.\n\nII. Condition federal subsidies on abolition of zoning and local land use regulation\n\nTake the $30 billion in spending and put it in a vault at Fort Knox and let local governments know that they will get no housing money until they have fully repealed all their Euclidian zoning – all of it. I\'m joking, but we need to see bedraggled folks near traffic lights and freeway exits holding cardboard signs saying, ""Planner – out of work. Anything helps!"" A major city will need people to process permits the same way the Department of Motor Vehicles processes your driver license; it isn\'t a question of whether or when you\'ll get it, you just have to show up and pay for it.\n\nLand use regulation based on the Euclid decision, zoning, is a 20th century solution to a 19th century problem. We simply don\'t need it and it is creating real human suffering. Short of repealing or conditioning the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, states and local governments will rule over land use. But what the federal government can do is turn off the flow of cash. There are many things that fed the vast invasive species of weed that is land use regulation in the United States, including the massive subsidies given to people who borrow with government backing for single-family homes. But subsidizing ""affordable"" housing has afforded local governments the freedom to propose all sorts of rules, regulations, fines, fees, and taxes that limit housing production. It needs to end.\n\nIII. Subsidies should only be used for direct rental assistance\n\nThere is no reason why a person who works for a living in this country should have to wait in line for housing subsidies, period. I\'ll keep this section efficient. If a person can demonstrate that they pay more than 30% of their gross monthly income on housing costs, they should get a direct deposit for the difference in their bank account. Will this practice make things worse? Maybe? Will it break the bank? We need to run the numbers. But I am willing to take the $30 billion we are spending every year and buy down the nations cost burden if for no other reason to turn off the shrieking fire alarm repeating ""Housing crisis! Housing crisis! Housing crisis!"" That thing is annoying. And I\'m convinced just paying people\'s rent makes more sense than more building, and it is compassionate.\n\nI\'m also convinced that if we took these steps, as unlikely as that may be, we\'d see the vast majority of working people find housing they can afford where they want to live for as long as they want to live there. For those that run into trouble, there would be a true safety net, ensuring that if income declined or rent increased, they\'d be able to keep living without worry where they live. Housing would proliferate and innovative solutions would appear in the market just like they do with every other commodity, and when prices rose people could find substitutes. Maybe you\'ve followed me this far and agree but wonder, ""What about the homeless?"" We\'ll cover that next. https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2023/04/12/series-consolidation-fewer-rules-and-direct-cash-will-end-the-housing-crisis/"
"How Influencer Marketing Could Shift In 2023: Aligning Values And Seeking Authenticity Cole Mason is cofounder and CEO of creator collaboration platform Pearpop.\n\nI believe we\'re on the cusp of a major change in the world of influencer marketing, and TikTok ""de-influencers"" like Mikayla Nogueira may have just inadvertently accelerated this shift in a way no one could\'ve predicted.\n\nRecently, the beauty influencer posted a video reviewing the new L\'Oreal Telescopic Lift mascara. She gushed over the product and claimed, ""I\'m not sure anyone is ever going to be able to compete with this mascara."" Comments immediately flooded in, suspecting that false eyelashes were added to the ""after"" shot. Many fans were fuming. TikTok users like @heyalexfriedman put a stake in the ground, saying it\'s ""the end of influencer marketing as we know it.""\n\nThis isn\'t the first time influencer authenticity has been called into question, but I have seen the conversation now reach a fever pitch. It\'s crucial to remember that influencer marketing rose to popularity expressly because it fostered authenticity in a way that marketers and advertisers had never seen before. Social media stars were relatable, everyday people whose followers looked to them for honest recommendations and real-life inspiration.\n\nAs companies have spent more in the influencer marketing space, with some estimates putting it at $15 billion in 2022, the notion of authenticity has begun to change. With six-figure brand deals for some creators now a norm, top influencers today are much more like celebrities than everyday people. This begs the question, what does the new world order of influencer marketing look like?\n\nIf we first recognize that in many cases mega influencers are the new A-list celebrities, I think brands should then naturally be thinking about these high-profile, top-tier creator collaborations in much the way we might think about a traditional celebrity endorsement--not to create the illusion of authenticity, but rather to raise a brand\'s awareness, reach or cache.\n\nAudiences no longer reasonably expect that a top-tier influencer is enthusiastically actually using the product in real life, but they may still be impressed and motivated by the brand\'s alignment with the talent they admire.\n\nSo while this time around audiences were surprised that Mikayla Nogueira\'s review may not have been genuine, in the future, audiences may not even expect it to be.\n\nFor brands seeking authenticity in influencer marketing, I believe the big shift in 2023 will be toward long-tail and mid-tier creators. These are a class of creators I have written about before. These creators have smaller, tighter networks of followers with similar values, lifestyles and interests. They might even have mutual friends with many of their followers in the real world, have attended the same school or work in the same industry.\n\nBecause their followers feel as though they truly know them as individuals, I see their recommendations as carrying more weight and ringing truer than with conventional celebrity or A-List endorsements. Rather than trying to sell a perfect image, the most successful mid-tier creators will showcase their true identity, flaws and all.\n\nAnd as for brand marketers, they\'ll need to change their stripes a bit too.\n\nInstead of seeking out only rave reviews and manicured product demonstrations, I recommend brands get comfortable with allowing creators the latitude, to be honest, real and unfiltered. I am a big proponent of allowing these evangelists of your brand do what they do best: Create authentic content on social with only a light touch from a brand\'s marketing team.\n\nIt\'s important for brands to partner and foster relationships with creators who align with them in terms of their values, beliefs, lifestyles and beyond, which will more likely be with long-tail and mid-tier influencers.\n\nI see us moving past wanting brands to uphold the perfect image created by traditional marketing tactics or looking up to large influencers who simply read a script and get paid for their positive reviews. Partnerships between brands and creators should read as legitimate in order to resonate because, in today\'s world, consumers see right through inauthentic content.\n\nInstead of brands trying to take control over creators\' content, they can have more control and decisiveness over who they choose to partner with. Rather than simply working with creators based on follower count, I think brands should dedicate more time to finding the right influencers who have similar priorities and are in line with what the company stands for, because naturally, the content will then make sense.\n\nOverall, if the partnership is strong, there shouldn\'t be a need to worry about having creative control. In this case, creators will remain trustworthy to their followers, and brands will build credibility at the same time.\n\nIn 2023, I expect we\'ll see more brands putting their budgets toward engaging dozens, hundreds or even thousands of long-tail and mid-tier creators and fewer blockbuster deals with single mega-creators. There will always be a role for A-List stars, but for brands looking to scale authentic social content with creators, I see the future in the power of long-tail.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

"Tokenization And The Future Of Finance: Unleashing The Power Of Blockchain In Global Markets CEO and cofounder of ZirconTech. Building blockchain projects since 2016.\n\nTokenization, the conversion of physical assets or financial instruments into digital tokens on a blockchain network, has been gaining significant attention recently. With blockchain technology acting as the foundation for this groundbreaking concept, it enables a secure, decentralized platform for creating, exchanging and trading digital tokens. Tokenization has the potential to transform financial markets and democratize investment opportunities, ultimately revolutionizing the global economy.\n\nIn this article, I'll examine the convergence of blockchain technology and financial markets, highlighting the significance of tokenization, its impact on the economy and how it disrupts traditional economic systems.\n\nBlockchain technology presents a secure and transparent framework for tokenization. By employing a decentralized ledger, blockchain networks facilitate the creation and management of digital tokens representing physical assets or financial instruments. These tokens can be traded, exchanged or utilized in various transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers.\n\nTokenization of blockchain technology offers several benefits.\n\n1. Security: The decentralized nature of blockchain networks ensures that information is secure and immutable, mitigating the risk of fraud or tampering.\n\n2. Transparency: Blockchain technology enables real-time tracking and auditing of transactions, fostering trust among participants and reducing the risk of errors or disputes.\n\n3. Cost Efficiency: Tokenization on blockchain eliminates intermediaries, significantly decreasing transaction costs and expediting settlement times.\n\n4. Accessibility: Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, enabling smaller investors to engage in asset classes previously limited to high-net-worth individuals or institutional investors.\n\nTokenization has the potential to reshape financial markets by creating new, more accessible and easily tradable financial assets. This can result in several substantial shifts in the financial landscape.\n\n1. Democratization Of Investment Opportunities: Tokenization facilitates fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy and sell portions of assets such as real estate, art or private equity. This expands investment opportunities to a broader audience, promoting financial inclusion and wealth generation.\n\n2. Enhanced Market Liquidity: Tokenization can release liquidity in previously illiquid asset classes, enabling more efficient trading and price discovery. This can lead to reduced transaction costs and improved market efficiency.\n\n3. Emergence Of New Markets: Tokenization allows for the establishment of entirely new markets and investment opportunities. For example, tokenized assets can be aggregated into diverse portfolios or investment products, offering unique risk-return profiles for investors.\n\n4. Regulatory Challenges: As tokenization becomes more popular, regulators face the task of adapting existing rules and frameworks to accommodate this new form of financial asset. This may result in new regulations or modifications to existing ones, potentially affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe widespread adoption of tokenization can yield significant economic advantages.\n\n1. Increased Economic Efficiency: Tokenization has the potential to boost overall economic efficiency by lowering transaction costs, streamlining asset management and enhancing market liquidity.\n\n2. Job Creation: The expansion of the tokenization industry can generate jobs in various sectors, including technology, finance and legal services.\n\n3. Financial Inclusion: By democratizing access to investment opportunities, tokenization can contribute to enhanced financial inclusion and wealth distribution, encouraging economic growth and stability.\n\n4. Innovation And Entrepreneurship: Tokenization can aid capital raising for startups and small businesses, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, which are crucial drivers of economic growth.\n\nTokenization is revolutionizing how we perceive assets and financial markets. By capitalizing on the security, transparency and efficiency of blockchain technology, tokenization holds the potential to transform financial markets and democratize investment opportunities.\n\nThe economic impact of tokenization is far-reaching, with the potential to bolster economic efficiency, create jobs, promote financial inclusion, and foster innovation and entrepreneurship. However, the emergence of tokenization also introduces regulatory challenges, as policymakers must adapt to this new financial landscape and ensure sufficient protections are in place for investors and the broader economy.\n\nAs tokenization continues to gain traction, it is essential for businesses, investors and regulators to understand and adapt to this emerging trend. By embracing the potential of tokenization and working collaboratively to address its challenges, we can unlock new economic opportunities and drive sustainable growth in the global economy. The future of finance lies in the integration of tokenization and blockchain technology, and those who are prepared to navigate this new landscape will be at the forefront of a financial revolution.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

"Bank of America Shareholders Asked to Increase Accountability for 'Woke' Chairman/CEO Brian Moynihan Longtime ESG Advocate Has Amassed Too Much Power\n\nFalls Church, VA --News Direct-- National Legal & Policy Center\n\nBank of America\'s annual meeting is scheduled for April 25, and shareholders will be asked to vote on a proposal that would increase accountability for the company\'s longtime Chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan.\n\nNational Legal and Policy Center is sponsoring Proposal No. 6 on the company\'s proxy statement, which requests the Board of Directors to require the two powerful roles now filled by Moynihan to be held by two separate individuals. NLPC argues that Moynihan has inappropriately engaged the company in a multitude of divisive political issues that are not in the fiduciary interest of Bank of America or its shareholders. As an investor in the company, NLPC has filed a report to the Securities and Exchange Commission that explains its rationale for identifying an equally authoritative counterpart to keep Moynihan\'s left-leaning political excursions in check.\n\n""Brian Moynihan has been around too long and has aggregated too much power, to the point where he seems to think and care little about the controversial political decisions he makes that implicate the company,"" said Paul Chesser, director of the Corporate Integrity Project for NLPC. ""For example, Bank of America has instituted lending and employee training programs that claim to promote racial advancement and healing, but instead are themselves racist.""\n\nIn its report to the SEC, NLPC points out several examples of Moynihan\'s leadership failures, including:\n\na $421 million commitment to over 130 equity funds that provide capital exclusively to non-white and female entrepreneurs and small business owners;\n\ncreating a discriminatory program that reduces interest rates for commercial borrowers that hit certain diversity quotas;\n\nzero-down payment, zero-closing cost mortgage advances for first-time home buyers only in black/African-American and Hispanic communities, without typically required home insurance or a credit score;\n\na ""Racial-Equity 21-day Challenge"" training program for employees that teaches that the United States is a ""racialized society"" that ""use[s] race to establish and justify systems of power, privilege, disenfranchisement, and oppression,"" which ""give[s] privileges to white people resulting in disadvantages to people of color"";\n\nhanding over the financial data of 211 clients to federal agents following the January 2021 U.S. Capitol disturbance, based on those customers being profiled simply because they visited an ATM in Washington at the time of the ""riot"";\n\nbuilding a held-to-maturity (""HTM"") portfolio that is high-risk and double the size of such assets in 2020, and increasing it by over 50 percent in 2021 – a purchasing spree with over 80 percent of the securities maturing in over 10 years, giving the Company significant exposure to interest rates.\n\nMoynihan has been more than willing to place Bank of America in a globalist posture, subjugating shareholders\' interests under those of the World Economic Forum agenda of transhumanism, abolition of private property, consumption of bugs, social credit systems, and other ""Great Reset"" priorities.\n\nAs chairman of the WEF\'s International Business Council, he worked with the big four accounting firms to create stakeholder standards for companies to follow. Moynihan said after this year\'s Davos confab about companies who fall short of such globalist standards, that ""we shouldn\'t do business with you."" WEF\'s agenda, he said, ""at the end of the day, will align capitalism with what society wants from it and get us going faster.""\n\n""Brian Moynihan\'s ego and elitism are so far gone, that he thinks he gets to redefine \'capitalism,\'"" Chesser said. ""And now he assumes that he and his fellow Davos elites can establish a new social credit system that decides who is and who isn\'t allowed to play in their newly redesigned \'capitalism\' playground.""\n\n""It\'s way past time for Bank of America to appoint a separate chairman to counterbalance Brian Moynihan\'s proclivities – as long as the board doesn\'t choose Klaus Schwab.""\n\nFounded in 1991, NLPC promotes ethics in public life and government accountability through research, investigation, education, and legal action.\n\nFor more information or to schedule an interview with Paul Chesser, contact Dan Rene at 202-329-8357 or drene@nlpc.org.\n\nNational Legal and Policy Center\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/bank-of-america-shareholders-asked-to-increase-accountability-for-woke-chairman-ceo-brian-moynihan-404200296 https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-america-shareholders-asked-increase-133000400.html"

"CPI Inflation Rate Cools, Lifting S&P 500 Futures; The Fed Would Be Crazy To Hike The consumer price index showed that price pressures slackened more than expected in March, as prices for energy and groceries fell, but core inflation remained firm. Although core inflation remains well above the Fed's target, the most timely data on the job market and credit conditions should give policymakers more than enough reason to forego one last right hike next month. S&P 500 futures rallied in early Wednesday stock market action after the CPI report.\n\nThe CPI inflation rate eased to 5.0%, down from 6% in February and below 5.2% forecasts. The consumer price index rose just 0.1% on the month, vs. forecasts of 0.3%.\n\nThe core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.4% vs. February levels, matching expectations. The annual core inflation rate edged up to 5.6%, matching forecasts. The core CPI inflation rate peaked at a 40-year-high 6.6% in September.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said that the most important category of spending for the inflation outlook is core nonhousing services, reported with the Commerce Department's late-month personal income and outlays data. Wall Street looks to the CPI gauge of services less rent of shelter as a reasonably close proxy, but it has serious shortcomings.\n\nMarch's CPI showed services less rent of shelter prices were unchanged on the month but rose 7.1% from a year ago vs. 6.9% in February. However, a 0.5% drop in the cost of medical care services distorted the monthly figure. That reflected a 4.2% monthly drop in the cost of health insurance. But the CPI report's methodology focused on health insurer profits from the previous year doesn't yield a timely, useful data point.\n\nAhead of the CPI report, markets were pricing in about 74% odds of a quarter-point Fed rate hike on May 3, dropping to 67% after the data. Just a week ago, those odds were only 43%.\n\nAlthough Friday's jobs report showed solid overall hiring, many underlying details like wage growth were soft. Yet the jobs report is based on midmonth surveys, which were conducted too early to exhibit any impact from the bank crisis that erupted just a week earlier.\n\nMore current data provides even more reason for concern about where the economy is headed.\n\nRevised data from the Labor Department, after a correction to its seasonal-adjustment methodology, shows that claims for unemployment benefits have been running much higher than realized. A total of 228,000 people applied for unemployment benefits in the week through April 1, far above views for 201,000. Claims for the prior week were revised up by 48,000 to 246,000.\n\nThe four-week average of jobless claims dipped -4,250 to 237,750. Yet that's still up about 25% since the start of October.\n\nOn Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business said its March survey of small businesses found that a net 15% of firms plan to hire in coming months. That's the lowest since May 2020, just after Covid hit.\n\nMeanwhile, the NFIB survey suggests small businesses are being starved for credit. Only a net 2% of firms think it's a good time to expand. Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, noted on Twitter that the measure matched the lowest level since 1980.\n\nCore goods prices rose 0.2% month. That raised the 12-month core goods inflation rate to 1.5% from 1%.\n\nEnergy prices dipped 0.6% on the month and are now down 3.5% from a year ago.\n\nPrices for food at home rose continued to moderate, actually falling 0.3% on the month. Food away from home prices rose 0.6% from February.\n\nThe CPI report showed used car prices falling 0.9%, while new vehicle prices rose 0.4%.\n\nApparel prices rose 0.3% and are now up 3.3% from a year ago. Transportation services prices rose 1.4%.\n\nAfter the CPI report, S&P 500 futures climbed 0.6%, easing off initial highs.

"Current Mortgage Interest Rates on April 12, 2023: Rates Tick Up     - CNET A few significant mortgage rates increased significantly over the last seven days. The average interest rates for both 15-year fixed and 30-year fixed mortgages both rose. The average rate of the most common type of variable-rate mortgage, the 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage, dropped very slightly however.\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis point increase to its benchmark short-term interest rate on March 22. This could have an impact on mortgage rates, but it\'s difficult to say just how much for a market already in flux.\n\n""We\'re in one of the most volatile markets in terms of rates since 2008,"" says Jennifer Beeston, senior vice president at Guaranteed Rate, a national mortgage lender.\n\nMortgages hit a 20-year high in late 2022, but now the macroeconomic environment is changing again. Rates dipped significantly in January before climbing back up in February.\n\nWhile rates don\'t directly track changes to the federal funds rate, they do respond to inflation. Overall, inflation remains high but has been slowly but consistently falling every month since it peaked in June 2022.\n\nAfter raising rates dramatically in 2022, the Fed opted for smaller, 25-basis-point rate increases in its first two meetings of 2023. The decision to hike by 0.25% on March 22 suggests that inflation is cooling and the central bank may be able to ease up -- but not stop -- on its rate hikes.\n\nWhile mortgage rates have dipped a bit from their December 2022 peak, they still aren\'t dramatically lower. Fewer buyers are willing to jump into the housing market, driving demand down and causing home prices to ease, but that\'s only part of the home affordability equation.\n\n""Even though home prices in many parts of the country have fallen since the start of the year, high rates make buying prohibitively expensive for many,"" says Jacob Channel, senior economist at loan marketplace LendingTree. It\'s still difficult for many buyers, particularly those looking for their first home, to afford a monthly payment.\n\nWhat does this mean for homebuyers this year? Mortgage rates are likely to decrease slightly in 2023, although they\'re highly unlikely to return to the rock-bottom levels of 2020 and 2021. However, rate volatility may continue for some time. ""Expect mortgage rates to yo-yo up and down in the first half of the year, at least until there is a consensus about when the Fed will conclude raising interest rates,"" says Greg McBride, CFA and chief financial analyst at Bankrate. (Like CNET Money, Bankrate is owned by Red Ventures.) McBride expects rates to fall more consistently as the year progresses. ""Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates will end the year near 5.25%,"" he predicts.\n\nRather than worrying about market mortgage rates, homebuyers should focus on what they can control: getting the best rate they can for their situation.\n\n""Instead of getting into the minutiae of what the market\'s doing every six seconds, buyers need to focus on what it is they\'re really trying to accomplish and have a good game plan,"" Beeston says.\n\nTake steps to improve your credit score and save for a down payment to increase your odds of qualifying for the lowest rate available. Also, be sure to compare the rates and fees from multiple lenders to get the best deal. Looking at the annual percentage rate, or APR, will show you the total cost of borrowing and help you compare apples to apples.\n\nThe average interest rate for a standard 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.87%, which is an increase of 17 basis points compared to one week ago. (A basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.) Thirty-year fixed mortgages are the most frequently used loan term. A 30-year fixed mortgage will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year fixed rate mortgage -- but also a lower monthly payment. Although you\'ll pay more interest over time -- you\'re paying off your loan over a longer timeframe -- if you\'re looking for a lower monthly payment, a 30-year fixed mortgage may be a good option.\n\nThe average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.16%, which is an increase of 16 basis points from seven days ago. You\'ll definitely have a higher monthly payment with a 15-year fixed mortgage compared to a 30-year fixed mortgage, even if the interest rate and loan amount are the same. But a 15-year loan will usually be the better deal, if you can afford the monthly payments. You\'ll most likely get a lower interest rate, and you\'ll pay less interest in total because you\'re paying off your mortgage much quicker.\n\nA 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage has an average rate of 5.72%, a drop of just 1 basis point from seven days ago. With an ARM mortgage, you\'ll typically get a lower interest rate than a 30-year fixed mortgage for the first five years. But since the rate adjusts with the market rate, you could end up paying more after that time, as described in the terms of your loan. Because of this, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be a good option if you plan to sell or refinance your house before the rate changes. If not, changes in the market may significantly increase your interest rate.\n\nMortgage rates were historically low throughout most of 2020 and 2021 but increased steadily throughout 2022. Now, mortgage rates are roughly twice what they were a year ago, pushed up by persistently high inflation. That high inflation prompted the Fed to raise its target federal funds rate seven times in 2022. By raising rates, the Fed makes it more expensive to borrow money and more appealing to keep money in savings, suppressing demand for goods and services.\n\nMortgage interest rates don\'t move in lockstep with the Fed\'s actions in the same way that, say, rates for a home equity line of credit do. But they do respond to inflation. As a result, cooling inflation data and positive signals from the Fed will influence mortgage rate movement more than the most recent 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\nWe use information collected by Bankrate to track rate changes over time. This table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the US:\n\nRates as of April 12, 2023.\n\nTo find a personalized mortgage rate, meet with your local mortgage broker or use an online mortgage service. In order to find the best home mortgage, you\'ll need to consider your goals and overall financial situation.\n\nThings that affect the interest rate you might get on your mortgage include: your credit score, down payment, loan-to-value ratio and your debt-to-income ratio. Having a higher credit score, a higher down payment, a low DTI, a low LTV or any combination of those factors can help you get a lower interest rate.\n\nThe interest rate isn\'t the only factor that affects the cost of your home. Be sure to also consider other costs such as fees, closing costs, taxes and discount points. Be sure to talk to a variety of lenders -- such as local and national banks, credit unions and online lenders -- and comparison shop to find the best loan for you.\n\nWhen picking a mortgage, remember to consider the loan term, or payment schedule. The most common loan terms are 15 years and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. Mortgages are further divided into fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. The interest rates in a fixed-rate mortgage are fixed for the duration of the loan. Unlike a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rates for an adjustable-rate mortgage are only fixed for a certain amount of time (most frequently five, seven or 10 years). After that, the rate changes annually based on the market rate.\n\nWhen choosing between a fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage, you should consider how long you plan to live in your house. Fixed-rate mortgages might be a better fit if you plan on living in a home for quite some time. Fixed-rate mortgages offer greater stability over time compared to adjustable-rate mortgages, but adjustable-rate mortgages might offer lower interest rates upfront. If you aren\'t planning to keep your new house for more than three to 10 years, however, an adjustable-rate mortgage might give you a better deal.

"MBTA completes $255M purchase of Widett Circle for future rail yard The MBTA has completed its purchase of a 24-acre parcel in Boston, bringing under the transit agency\'s umbrella a strategically located plot that officials say is critical to improving commuter rail operations and a pair of major expansion projects.\n\nT officials announced Wednesday they finalized a $255 million deal to buy the land at Widett Circle, capping a years-long effort that began under the Baker administration.\n\nThe MBTA plans to install new commuter rail facilities at the parcel, which is adjacent to Interstate 93 and just about one mile south of South Station, to store trains while they are offline and perform maintenance for nine of the T\'s 14 commuter rail lines.\n\nThat will bring several benefits, including less train congestion on the Fairmount Line, more platform space at South Station and reduced diesel emissions in Boston-area environmental justice communities, the T said.\n\nThe current commuter rail yard closest to downtown Boston is in the city\'s Readville area, nine miles from South Station.\n\n""As a result, trains that are not in passenger service must travel back and forth along the Fairmount Line creating a burden on resources including train crews, additional costs associated with the use of fuel, as well as the potential for creating congestion along the line,"" a T spokesperson wrote in a press release summarizing the deal. ""A central location for a layover yard will allow trains to begin and end service from each corridor more efficiently. By adding a layover yard that is only one mile from South Station, the MBTA will be able to reduce its \'deadhead\' miles by more than 50,000 miles per year, reducing operating costs by shortening trips to and from the layover yard and increasing capacity for trains in passenger service.""\n\nThe boost in accessible maintenance services and layover space are ""critical"" for operating more frequent service on the Fairmount and Worcester Lines, according to the T, and also key to the in-development South Coast Rail expansion and proposed East-West Rail expansion.\n\n""Completing the acquisition of Widett Circle is a major step forward toward our goals of improving Commuter Rail service in the near term as well as the future vision for rail that is more frequent, reliable, and better positioned to embrace new and greener technology,"" MBTA General Manager Phillip Eng, who started his job on Monday, said in a statement. ""This complex process was only successful thanks to the collaborative efforts involving the T, MassDOT, and the City of Boston. I look forward to continued progress in providing the kind of service our customers expect and deserve.""\n\nGov. Maura Healey called the purchase ""an important step in our efforts to improve rail operations and make service more efficient and reliable.""\n\n""Our administration is grateful for the hard work that went into making this purchase possible and we look forward to continued collaboration with local leaders and the community to ensure we are making the most of this opportunity,"" Healey said in a statement.\n\nIn December, when the MBTA Board approved negotiating a deal for Widett Circle, officials said they had been eyeing the land for ""decades"" and viewed it as a linchpin to long-term commuter rail improvements.\n\nMBTA staff identified Widett Circle as a ""critical location to provide layover functions"" and included a proposed rail yard there in South Station Expansion project environmental filings that won approval in 2016 and 2017, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe board approved using $155 million in Department of Transportation funds and $100 million in MBTA capital investment plan funds to secure the purchase, according to the T.\n\nPost-pandemic ridership on the commuter rail has rebounded at a higher rate than the MBTA\'s core subway system, roughly matching the bus network\'s performance with 68 percent as many riders in February 2023 as before COVID.\n\n-- Chris Lisinski / SHNS https://www.bostonherald.com/2023/04/12/mbta-completes-255m-purchase-of-widett-circle-for-future-rail-yard/"

Some of the fishermen were shown ripping out the spiny stinger with gloved hands, and tossing the sting rays back into the Pacific.\n\nWhile some claimed the rays could survive and re-grow their stingers, it was unclear if that was true, or how many would survive the brutal treatment.

"Photos: In Iraq, a Mosul Ramadan is special Mosul, Iraq – In this northern Iraqi city, Ramadan is said to have a flavour different from anywhere else in Iraq.\n\nA few days before the beginning of the holy month, people start going to the markets to prepare for the days of fast. The oldest and most prominent of these is Bab al-Saray in old Mosul.\n\n Muhammad Ghanem, 42, owns a spice shop at al-Attarin market in Bab al-Saray. Markets are always busier in Ramadan as people prepare to put on big family meals, he tells Al Jazeera.\n\n""The other thing about this market that attracts people is that people can find everything they need here, including clothes, food, household items, and everything at cheap prices compared to other markets. Even people from neighbouring cities come to this market to shop during Ramadan.""\n\nA Mosul Ramadan speciality is raisin juice, made with the best raisins from the mountains of Iraq\'s Kurdish region as well as fresh mint.\n\nMasaharati, or al-masharaji in the Iraqi dialect, is another Ramadan feature. This folkloric occupation is practised only during the holy month, as a man walks through the alleyways of the old city and beats his drum, calling loudly to fasting folk to wake up and have their suhoor meal before a day of fasting begins. The masaharati features in Ramadan in a number of other Muslim countries as well.\n\nGhufran Thamer, a 31-year-old Mosuli, is roaming the alleys of old Mosul to wake people up for the sixth year in a row. He was the first to restore this Mosuli heritage after the city was liberated from the ISIL (ISIS) armed group.\n\nAnother popular figure the people of Mosul love is the hakawati, or storyteller, who first appeared during the Ottoman era, sitting in public spaces to tell stories to passers-by who would stop and gather around to listen.\n\nHe tells old stories he heard from his parents and grandparents, or stories someone wrote for him, or stories he writes himself, but all of them are a source of wisdom and life lessons. https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/4/12/photos-in-iraq-a-mosul-ramadan-is-special"

"US inflation fell in March for the ninth month in a row The pace of US consumer price increases continued to cool down in March from last summer\'s scorching-hot levels: Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, dropped for the ninth consecutive month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.\n\nPrices rose 5% for the 12 months ended in March, down from 6% in February. It\'s the smallest 12-month increase since May 2021.\n\nOn a monthly basis, CPI, which measures price changes over time for a basket of goods, ticked up 0.1% from February, as compared to a previous 0.4% increase.\n\nShelter costs were the largest contributor of the monthly gain, offsetting sharp declines across energy categories, according to the BLS.\n\nAnd for the first time since September 2020, grocery prices fell on a monthly basis: The food at home index dropped 0.3% for the month, helped by lower prices in eggs (which fell nearly 11%) and fruits and vegetables (which declined 1.3%).\n\nEconomists were expecting an annual increase of 5.2% and a monthly gain of 0.2%, according to Refinitiv.\n\nStripping out the often-volatile components of food and energy, core CPI grew 0.4% for the month, resulting in a 5.6% annual growth rate. In February, core CPI accelerated 0.5% month on month and 5.5% year over year.\n\nCPI is one of the major inflation gauges that\'s being watched like a hawk by the Federal Reserve, which is in the throes of a yearlong campaign to battle inflation through monetary tightening and stark interest rate hikes.\n\nThat fight grew more complex in March with the collapse of two regional US banks, which then caused turmoil in the financial industry. The Fed, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in to shore up depositors and prevent future bank runs.\n\nHowever, there are expectations that the turmoil could mean future credit tightening, which in turn could dampen demand and even help the Fed in its inflation-fighting goals. However, it could also create more uncertainty about a future recession.\n\n""The CPI is backwards looking and the Fed still has to consider how much of a credit crunch to factor into the economy,"" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management, in a statement.\n\nWhile inflation has moderated since reaching a decades-high level last summer, the pace has been slower than anticipated as a strong labor labor market and resilient consumer spending has continued to fuel economic growth. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/economy/cpi-inflation-march/index.html"
"Buffett: 'Nobody is going to lose money on a deposit in a U.S. bank' Warren Buffett restored confidence in banks during the 2008 financial crisis. On Wednesday he offered up some new words of assurance about the turmoil that gripped regional banks in March.\n\nPeople ""do not need to be panicked"" about the industry and ""nobody is going to lose money on a deposit in a U.S. bank,"" the billionaire who runs Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) said in an interview with CNBC. ""It\'s not going to happen.""\n\nThese were the first public comments from the ""Oracle of Omaha"" in the month since federal regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank following deposit runs at both institutions.\n\nThe failures, the second- and third-largest in U.S. history, triggered panic that more lenders could be equally vulnerable. Regulators, including the FDIC, stabilized the situation by promising to protect depositors and free up more liquidity for other regional lenders.\n\nThe FDIC insures depositors up to $250,000 per account and pledged to cover even uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The costs of the FDIC fund used to backstop depositors, Buffett added, comes from banks and not from taxpayer money.\n\n""Banks have never cost the federal government a dime. The public doesn\'t understand that.""\n\nBuffett downplayed any comparison to the crisis in 2008, noting that in this case some banks mismanaged their assets and liabilities. ""Some of the dumb things banks do periodically have been uncovered during this period,"" said Buffett. But ""they haven\'t made the same sort of mistakes as they made back in 2008.""\n\nHe also warned that banks can lose the confidence of the public in seconds and that more could in fact go down. ""We\'re not over bank failures.""\n\nBuffett has played the role of savior in past banking crises. During the debacle of 2008, Goldman Sachs Group (GS) came to him seeking capital and his stamp of approval. Buffett injected $5 billion into Goldman.\n\nHe then injected another $5 billion into Bank of America (BAC) in 2011, when Brian Moynihan was still a relatively new chief executive and the lender\'s shares were under pressure due to losses from subprime loans. He is still a large shareholder of Bank of America.\n\nIt was also Buffett who suggested in 2008 to then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson that the federal government should inject capital into banks to stabilize the industry. That became an official proposal of $250 billion, even though some of the biggest banks insisted they didn\'t need the money.\n\nReuters reported last month that Buffett had discussions with the Biden administration about the banks.

Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThree construction workers were injured Tuesday when part of an upper floor collapsed inside Savannah\'s 124-year-old federal courthouse, which has been undergoing extensive renovations for more than a year.\n\nAll three workers were taken to a hospital, none of them with life-threatening injuries, after part of the courthouse\'s third floor gave way and the workers tumbled down to the floor below, said Savannah Fire Battalion Chief Wayne Ifill. Everyone else inside the building was accounted for and not injured, he said.\n\n""We went through the building twice to make sure,"" Ifill said. ""Now we know for a fact that it\'s completely empty.

"Flip Launches MagicOS to Restore Trust in Shopping New Shopping Social Network Makes It Easy For Brands to Launch and Scale\n\nLOS ANGELES, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Flip, the shopping social network restoring trust in shopping, today launched MagicOS, the self-service e-commerce operating system that offers everything a brand needs to launch and scale. The Flip app is a destination for discovery -- powered by community and patented technology that links user video reviews to confirmed purchases -- and MagicOS opens an end-to-end marketplace of consumers and brands across a number of new categories spanning lifestyle, wellness & nutrition, electronics, fitness, home goods, and more.\n\nToday\'s consumers no longer trust influencers and see right through traditional marketing. In e-commerce, the rush of finding the perfect item with friends has been replaced by row after row of curated images and descriptions. Flip, with its unique shopping experience that eliminates mindless scrolling and sparks spontaneous discovery backed by genuine video reviews, is the future. With MagicOS, brands like e.l.f. Cosmetics and HUM Nutrition focus on creating the best products and Flip takes care of everything else -- from driving brand awareness and seeding products to shoppers to generating honest content that drives sales and providing business performance insights.\n\n""The next generation of shopping experiences must be powered by people,"" said Noor Agha, founder and CEO at Flip. ""People trust people, not influencers or brands. For consumers to choose new products with confidence, they must be able to find genuine feedback on those products from real shoppers, who have actually used them. Flip is giving power in e-commerce back to the people, and MagicOS makes it easy for top brands to join our revolution and reach consumers seeking an authentic shopping experience.""\n\nEquipping Buyers and Sellers with Premium e-Commerce Services On Flip, a brand\'s customers are both ambassadors and content creators. The platform builds trust by requiring its more than 2 million users to buy the actual product before being able to post reviews -- then giving them the power to speak their minds, positive or negative. Brands are not allowed to incentivize creators for reviews on Flip. The radical honesty builds trust and drives engagement. MagicOS is the operating system allowing Flip to hyper-charge its growth, accelerating from 10 brands onboarded per month before the self-serve system began beta testing in November to hundreds of new brands per month today and scaling to thousands of brands by the end of June.\n\nMagicOS is a truly end-to-end system where users viewing engaging short form videos on the Flip App -- shoppers spend 25 minutes per day on the app and Flip averages 35 million monthly video views -- are using the same platform as brands uploading their product catalogs and teams managing inventory, orders and the supply chain. Unlike other social apps, Flip\'s one-click payment experience does not require leaving the app for a third-party website.\n\n""Authentic video reviews are a crucial growth engine for our brand,"" said Edward Madongorere, co-founder and CEO at MOON Ultra. ""With Flip and MagicOS, we had a seamless onboarding experience, immediately resulting in instant feedback from the community of shoppers and creators buying and reviewing our products. Our products are made with the creator in mind, and Flip totally aligns with that. We\'re thrilled by the organic engagement and our hyper sales growth.""\n\nFlip is leveraging cutting-edge technology to deliver personalized shopping experiences that meet the needs and preferences of each individual customer. To that end, the company hired Hao Ma as VP of AI and Data Science. Ma was most recently a director at Meta\'s Discovery Org, where he led more than 200 research scientists and engineers in building one of the industry\'s best recommender systems. Kapil Mokhat, former Head of Commerce at Venmo and Head of Payments Programs and Partnerships at Airbnb, also recently joined the company as President focused on scaling the Flip ecosystem.\n\nThe launch of MagicOS follows Flip\'s $60 million Series B funding round led by WestCap & Streamlined Ventures in 2022, which valued the company at $500 million and brought its total amount of financing raised to $95 million.\n\nFor more information about partnering with Flip, visit https://company.flip.shop/sellwithflip.\n\nAbout Flip Flip is building the next-generation shopping social network for people to shop through other people. With a growing community of shoppers sharing video reviews of products they\'ve purchased on the platform, buyers can discover products through 60 second videos of user-generated content that is instantly shoppable with a one-click checkout and same day shipping. Every shopper can then become a creator by sharing their own reviews and monetizing their content.

"Maine city turns basketball arena into migrant shelter, asks residents for donations Portland activist Richard Ward discusses illegal immigration and the homeless crisis troubling the city.\n\nMaine\'s largest city is seeking donations to help mitigate the migrant surge after it reopened its historic basketball arena, the Portland Exposition Building, to house hundreds of asylum seekers.\n\nBut some residents are not happy with the city\'s action to overextend its already-limited housing resources as homeless Americans continue to line the streets.\n\nPortland activist Richard Ward suggested Wednesday the municipal priorities may be upside down after claiming the city gave vagrants sleeping bags and tents while migrants were housed in the Expo Center.\n\nNEW HOMELESS SHELTER OPENS IN PORTLAND, MAINE, AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING\n\n""Last year they told the people that were Mainers, Americans that were homeless – they gave them tents and sleeping bags and they kind of did the same thing,"" Ward told ""Fox & Friends First."" ""The Expo Center was opened up for asylum seekers and then Americans that were homeless were given tents and sleeping bags.""\n\nWard agreed that the city ""essentially"" told Americans to fend for themselves as officials placed migrants seeking asylum in shelters with access to personal necessities.\n\nThe city\'s spokesperson, Jessica Grondin, told the Portland Press Herald that the cost of running the Expo Center will likely exceed $100,000, and that is why they are seeking donations to help mitigate the cost.\n\nMaine\'s Portland Exposition Building is being opened to migrants for the second time in recent years amid an immigration surge and concurrent housing shortage. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)\n\nThat same report also alleged it cost the city around $400,000 to run the arena as a migrant shelter back in 2019, and it raised more than $900,000 for the cause in private donations.\n\nThe Expo Center reopened Monday and will shelter up to 300 people per night, offering them a bed, three meals a day, health care screenings and immunizations.\n\nDENVER TO SPEND UP TO $20 MILLION ON MIGRANTS IN JUST SIX MONTHS, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nBut the city is reaching its maximum capacity for housing migrants, accounting for both the reopening of the arena and another emergency shelter that hit its 208-person capacity on opening night last month, according to Kristen Dow, Portland\'s director of Health and Human services.\n\nWard suggested that although the cause to aid those seeking asylum is well-intentioned, Americans battling housing challenges should come first.\n\n""I think we should be taking care of Americans first,"" Ward said. ""It\'s not that the asylum seekers are bad people. Some of them are great people. But we have Americans here sleeping under bridges, people sleeping in tents. There\'s just no shelter for them.""\n\n""There\'s not enough housing here for people that even live here, a thousand people is just a huge strain on a city… when there\'s just no housing available already,"" he continued.\n\nMore than 1,000 migrants have traveled to Portland since the beginning of the year, and the city has provided space and personal essentials for around 1,200 asylum seekers every night through its shelters and hotels.\n\nMany of the migrants are from Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDow claimed that once the temporary emergency shelter fills to capacity, there will be no more space the city can utilize to accommodate additional asylum seekers.\n\nNevertheless, Ward demanded action from the governor, urging her to take action to alleviate the housing crisis facing American families in the city.\n\n""The governor, Janet Mills, should go out and see with our own eyes how bad Americans have it here and the homeless crisis that\'s here in Portland,"" Ward said. ""The city just kind of like lets them go. And as long as they set their tents up, not where, you know, people can really see them all day, then nobody cares.""\n\n""The Democratic government here and the Democratic socialists care more about abortion rights and expanding abortion to nine months than they do care about helping homeless people,"" he continued.\n\nThe arena is planned to remain open through August. https://www.foxnews.com/media/maine-city-turns-basketball-arena-migrant-shelter-asks-residents-donations"
"Dozens of Russian draftees were locked in a factory and forced to sign contracts with the Wagner Group at gunpoint, report says Dozens of Russian draftees said they were locked in a factory and forced to sign contracts with the Wagner Group at gunpoint, the independent Russia media outlet Astra reported on Tuesday.\n\nAlmost 200 draftees were unknowingly bussed from Russia to the Luhansk region in Ukraine in the middle of the night last week, the outlet reported, citing reviewed text and audio messages the soldiers sent to their family members.\n\nThe group of soldiers was then dumped in a railway car repair plant in Stakhanov, where they were held at gunpoint by officials who were ""herding"" them around, one of the draftees told his family, according to a translation by The Daily Beast.\n\n""They\'re already herding us around at gunpoint, that\'s it, the turning of the screws has started,"" the soldier said. ""Representatives of Wagner arrived with weapons, there are about 30 of them.""\n\nThe group then forced soldiers to sign contracts with them, according to the outlet. It added that the Russians themselves said in conversations with their relatives that they were ""sold to [Wagner].""\n\nInsider was unable to independently verify whether a transaction actually took place.\n\n""We don\'t have a choice,"" another soldier told a relative about signing the contract, according to the report. ""Those who said \'no\' – they\'ve already been taken away and I don\'t know what is happening to them now. You see, they don\'t give a fuck, they\'ll kill us and dump us in the field and that\'s it.""\n\nFifty-seven out of 170 draftees agreed to sign contracts with the paramilitary group, while the rest refused to sign and were transported elsewhere in Ukraine\'s Luhansk region, Astra reported.\n\nAll of their phones were confiscated and it is unclear where they are now, the outlet added.\n\nDespite some internal conflict, the Wagner Group has been working closely with Russia since the start of its invasion of Ukraine last year.\n\nThe Wagner Group, which is seen as a de-facto private military service for the Kremlin, has been heavily involved in Russia\'s attempt to capture the embattled Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, deploying tens of thousands of fighters there.\n\nSome of its fighters are professional contract soldiers while many others are convicted criminals.\n\nBut as the battle drags on, the private military has been struggling to recruit members, the Institute for the Study of War think tank said last month.

Lindsey Graham said Tuesday he had a ""very productive"" meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom he previously criticized following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n""I just had a very productive, candid meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince and his senior leadership team. The opportunity to enhance the U.S.-Saudi relationship is real and the reforms going on in Saudi Arabia are equally real,"" Graham tweeted.\n\nGraham, in a three-part tweet, said he looked forward to working with the Biden administration and Congress to ""see if we can take the U.S.-Saudi relationship to the next level, which would be a tremendous economic benefit to both countries and bring much-needed stability to a troubled region.""\n\n""I also expressed deep appreciation to the Kingdom for purchasing $37 billion worth of Boeing 787s – which are made in South Carolina – for the new Saudi airline. Investments like this are game changers,"" Graham said in a tweet.\n\nSoon after Khashoggi was murdered, Graham delivered a strong message to reporters in October 2018 as speculation ramped up that the journalist\'s death was ordered by the highest levels of the royal court in Saudi Arabia. ""There\'ll be a bipartisan tsunami against Saudi Arabia here if they did, in fact, do this,"" Graham told reporters at the time.\n\nIn November 2018, Graham said, ""Don\'t think Congress is going to look away if he\'s (bin Salman) making the world a more dangerous place. We are not going to give an autocratic leader a pass.""\n\nA declassified US intelligence report that was released in February 2021 said the crown prince approved the operation to capture or kill the Saudi journalist.\n\nGraham did not reference Khashoggi\'s death in his tweets Tuesday about his meeting with the crown prince.\n\nThe country\'s state-run Saudi Press Agency also tweeted about the meeting between Graham and Prince bin Salman, including pictures, and said the two reviewed ""the friendly relations between the two countries.""\n\nGraham\'s meeting with the crown prince is reflective of the uneasy accommodation the US government has made with the de facto Saudi leader following Khashoggi\'s murder. President Joe Biden has expressed outrage over the incident and blamed bin Salman, but last summer, amid soaring oil prices, he traveled to Saudi Arabia and gave the crown prince a fist bump, providing a photo opportunity for the Saudi government and outraging human rights groups.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan and bin Salman also spoke on Tuesday amid recent tension between the two countries following the news that OPEC  will cut oil production starting in May.\n\n""They discussed a number of global and regional matters to include ongoing diplomacy related to ending the war in Yemen,"" according to a White House readout of the call. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/lindsey-graham-mohammed-bin-salman-meeting/index.html"

"Brazil: Wärtsilä to operate power modules and support Brazilian offshore operator with Optimised Maintenance Agreement Technology group Wärtsilä will operate the power modules onboard a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, on behalf of the owner 3R Petroleum. The vessel operates in the Papa Terra oilfield in Brazilian waters. Wärtsilä has also signed a five-year Optimised Maintenance Agreement with 3R Petroleum to ensure the reliability and performance of the installation. The order was included in Wärtsilä's order book in December 2022.\n\n3R Petroleum has purchased the oilfield from Petrobras, with whom Wärtsilä had an earlier agreement. The FPSO vessel has three power modules, each with two Wärtsilä 50DF dual-fuel engines. Under the new contract, Wärtsilä will continue to have an onboard crew operating the modules on a 24/7 basis. For the Optimised Maintenance Agreement, Wärtsilä will monitor the engine performance remotely enabled by the cyber secure connectivity solution. With the Dynamic Maintenance Planning the time between overhauls can be optimised which provides flexibility for scheduling maintenance.\n\n'We are pleased to have Wärtsilä as a skilled and experienced partner in operating and maintaining this FPSO. We feel that they are clearly the most qualified company for this project, and we look forward to working with them,' says Humberto Romanus, Facilities Manager for 3R Petroleum.\n\n'We have been involved with this vessel since the beginning when it was owned by the Petrobras group. We are very happy to continue this cooperation with the new owners,' explains Carlos Mikus, Lifecycle Sales Manager at Wärtsilä.\n\nWärtsilä Optimised Maintenance Agreements provide long-term cost predictability and asset availability. Data-driven maintenance is used at every stage, from planning to execution.

"Qatar: QatarEnergy selects Sinopec as North Field East expansion partner QatarEnergy has announced the signing of a definitive partnership agreement with China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) for the North Field East (NFE) expansion project, the largest project in the history of the LNG industry.\n\nThe agreement was signed by His Excellency Mr. Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the Minister of State for Energy Affairs, the President and CEO of QatarEnergy, and Dr. MA Yong-sheng, the Chairman of Sinopec in a special signing ceremony held today at QatarEnergy's headquarters and attended by senior executives from both companies.\n\nThe agreement marks the entry of Sinopec as a shareholder in one of the NFE joint venture companies that own the NFE project, one of the most critical projects in the global LNG industry. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, QatarEnergy will transfer to Sinopec a 5% interest in the equivalent of one NFE train with a capacity of 8 million tons per annum (MTPA). This agreement will not affect the participating interests of any of the other shareholders.\n\nSpeaking at the signing ceremony, His Excellency Al-Kaabi said: 'The People's Republic of China is a major driver of the global energy markets as well as being one of the most important gas markets in the world and is a key market for Qatari energy products. Today's event underscores QatarEnergy's commitment to deepening its relationships with key LNG consumers, while prioritizing long-term strategic partnerships and alignment with world class partners from China, represented by Sinopec here today.'\n\nNoting the November 2022 agreement to supply Sinopec with 4 MTPA of LNG from the NFE project, His Excellency Minister Al-Kaabi said: 'That agreement was not only the first NFE LNG supply agreement to be announced, but also the longest LNG supply agreement in the history of the industry. Today, Sinopec will join Qatar's LNG family becoming the first Asian shareholder in the NFE project.'\n\nMinister Al-Kaabi concluded his remarks by saying: 'We are pleased to enter into this milestone agreement with Sinopec, marking yet another landmark in the excellent bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and the State of Qatar. I would like to thank the working teams in QatarEnergy and Sinopec for their dedicated work to reach this important agreement. We are always indebted to the wise leadership of His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and to his continued guidance and support of the energy sector.'\n\nOn his part, Dr. Ma Yongsheng, the Chairman of Sinopec, congratulated both parties on signing the NFE project partnership agreement and said: 'The meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Qatar's Amir His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani during the first China-Arab Summit and China-GCC Summit in 2022, comprehensively outlined the development blueprint of the strategic partnership between the two countries and guided the China-Qatar energy cooperation. The signing of this agreement today is a concrete move to carry forward what has been agreed between the two heads of state and deepen the partnership between Sinopec and QatarEnergy. It is another milestone after the signing of the long-term LNG SPA from the NFE project in November 2022, marking the integrated cooperation achieved by both companies on the NFE project.'\n\nDr. Ma further added that 'China-Qatar energy cooperation features a natural complementarity. QatarEnergy is a leading LNG producer in the world and one of the most important partners of Sinopec. The cooperation with QatarEnergy will help Sinopec further optimize China's energy consumption structure and enhance the security, stability, and reliability of clean energy supply. I hope that the two companies will continue to explore new LNG cooperation opportunities based on the solid foundation we have laid together and will further expand cooperation areas to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results.'\n\nThis agreement is the first of its kind after last year's series of partnership announcements in the $28.75 billion NFE project, which will raise Qatar's LNG export capacity from the current 77 MTPA to 110 MTPA.\n\nOriginal article link https://www.energy-pedia.com/news/qatar/qatarenergy-selects-sinopec-as-north-field-east-(nfe)-expansion-partner-191161"

"Water-based batteries store more energy than previously thought Cobalt-free aqueous batteries consist of a cathode, an electrolyte and an anode. The cathodes and anodes are polymers that can store energy, and the electrolyte is water mixed with organic salts. The electrolyte is key to ion conduction and energy storage through its interactions with the electrode.\n\nAccording to the new article, redox-active, non-conjugated radical polymers (electrodes) are promising candidates for metal-free aqueous batteries because of the polymers\' high discharge voltage and fast redox kinetics. The reaction is complex and difficult to resolve because of the simultaneous transfer of electrons, ions and water molecules.\n\n""We demonstrate the nature of the redox reaction by examining aqueous electrolytes of varying chao-/kosmotropic character using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring at a range of timescales,"" the paper reads.\n\nThe Texas A&M research group complemented its experimental efforts with computational simulations and analyses. The simulations gave insights into the microscopic molecular-scale picture of the structure and dynamics.\n\n""Theory and experiment often work closely together to understand these materials. One of the new things that we do computationally in this paper is that we actually charge up the electrode to multiple states of charge and see how the surroundings respond to this charging,"" paper co-author Daniel Tabor said.\n\nTabor and his colleagues macroscopically observed if the battery cathode was working better in the presence of certain kinds of salts by measuring exactly how much water and salt is going into the battery as it is operating.\n\n""We did that to explain what has been observed experimentally,"" he said. ""Now, we would like to expand our simulations to future systems. We needed to have our theory confirmed of what are the forces that are driving that kind of injection of water and solvent.""\n\nIn the researcher\'s view, this new energy storage technology could be a push forward to lithium-free batteries.\n\n""We have a better molecular level picture of what makes some battery electrodes work better than others, and this gives us strong evidence of where to go forward in materials design,"" Tabor said. https://www.mining.com/water-based-batteries-store-more-energy-than-previously-thought/"

"California lawmakers consider proposal to improve outcomes for Black, low-income students Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe California Legislature is weighing a proposal by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside $300 million for low-income schools, but some education advocates say it won\'t do enough to improve educational outcomes for Black students.\n\nAssemblymember Akilah Weber, a Democrat from San Diego, introduced a bill last year aimed at ensuring more education money reaches Black students. But she pulled the bill after conversations with Newsom, citing concerns that it could violate the state or U.S. Constitution because it focused on one specific racial group, even though it didn\'t specifically use the word ""Black.""\n\nWeber and other members of the Legislative Black Caucus worked with the Democratic governor to come up with the new approach that instead targets money to schools with a high concentration of students who qualify for free lunch under a federal program.\n\nGOP SENATOR SAYS BIDEN\'S DEPT. OF EDUCATION IMPOSING \'DANGEROUS DELAYS\' ON SCHOOL SECURITY FUNDS\n\nWeber called the proposal and guidelines to hold districts accountable for using money to improve student outcomes ""game changers for closing persistent opportunity and outcome gaps in California.""\n\n""This proposal is exactly what our state needs to work toward repairing the longstanding harms of inequity in education and ensuring our schools are more fair and accessible for all students,"" she said in a statement.\n\nWhile Newsom\'s proposal is racking up support from Weber and other lawmakers, some advocates who backed Weber\'s bill from last year say California must come up with a more targeted solution to benefit Black students. They are concerned about the stark disparity between Black students\' academic performance and that of their peers. The Black in School Coalition, which backed Weber\'s prior bill, led a rally of thousands of advocates and students outside the Capitol on Tuesday following a legislative hearing on the new proposal.\n\nThe coalition wants the $300 million to be targeted at schools with a large portion of students who perform poorly on at least two of the following indicators outlined by the Department of Education: academic performance, chronic absenteeism, college or career advancement, English learner progress, graduation rate, and suspension rate.\n\n""For 10 years, we\'ve had a funding formula that has done nothing in particular for Black students, and it\'s time for that to change,"" said Margaret Fortune, CEO for a network of charter schools aimed at closing the achievement gap for Black students.\n\nFortune was referring to what is known as the Local Control Funding Formula, which dictates how school districts are funded.\n\nVanessa Oden, vice principal of elementary at Elite Public Schools in Vallejo, attends a Black in School Coalition rally in Sacramento, California, on April 11, 2023. The rally was held to oppose an education budget proposal for not going far enough to close the academic achievement gap for Black students. (Renée C. Byer/The Sacramento Bee via AP)\n\nThe educator previously brought the issue to the state\'s Reparations Task Force, a group studying how the state can atone for the legacy of slavery and policies that discriminated against African Americans.\n\nAbout 70% of Black students failed to meet state testing standards for English Language Arts in the 2021-2022 school year, compared with less than 40% of white students, according to state data. About 84% of Black students didn\'t meet math standards, compared with about 50% of white students.\n\nUnder Newsom\'s proposal, the money would go to elementary and middle schools with at least 90%, of students qualifying for free meals under the program and high schools with at least 85% of students qualifying for free meals.\n\n""Governor Newsom\'s proposal is a monumental shift in California\'s longstanding fight to close persistent achievement gaps and deliver on the promise of an equitable education for all students,"" Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson from Newsom, said in a statement.\n\nStudents from majority-Black districts would also benefit from the accountability portion of Newsom\'s budget proposal, which requires districts to implement strategies to improve academic outcomes, Gardon said.\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCES SCHOOL SECURITY, TRAININGS AFTER WAVE OF COPYCAT SHOOTING THREATS\n\nThe proposal as it was originally written gives wide latitude to schools on how to spend the money but would require them to report how funds are used to the state.\n\nLess than 26% of Black students attend a school that would qualify under the plan, CalMatters reported.\n\nTinsae Birhanu, a student and health ambassador for the Black Students of California United, said the state needs to do more to improve outcomes for Black students, including making sure the makeup of teachers is more diverse and combating high expulsion rates.\n\n""Our education system should be nothing less than what we deserve,"" Birhanu said.\n\nAt the budget subcommittee hearing, Assemblymember Kevin McCarty, a Democrat representing Sacramento suburbs and the committee\'s chair, expressed his support for the proposal but noted that increasing funding for schools isn\'t a cure-all for ending academic disparities.\n\n""So much of these are outside of the classroom,"" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe noted other factors that contribute to poorer performance from students, including coming from a family that has experienced intergenerational poverty and is living in an under-resourced neighborhood.\n\nAssemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat who represents the Los Angeles suburbs, questioned the Newsom administration during the hearing about how funding would be used to specifically benefit students and improve their performance in schools, such as by hiring literary coaches or tutors.\n\nRepresentatives from Newsom\'s administration didn\'t have clear answers. Department of Finance officials said the proposal aims to ensure transparency in how the money is spent.\n\nNewsom\'s administration released its initial budget proposal in January. As the administration continues to testify before budget subcommittees, they can make changes to the language in the budget. They have until May to continue making changes, and the Legislature must pass a budget by June 15. https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-lawmakers-consider-proposal-improve-outcomes-black-low-income-students"
"Bank of America clients have yanked $451 million from real-estate stocks as commercial property becomes investors' newest worry Bank of America\'s clients pulled $451 million from real-estate stocks last week as troubles in the commercial property sector heat up.\n\n""Outflows from real estate were the largest since July 2021 amid concerns around commercial real estate,"" bank\'s strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nWorries about the health of the commercial property sector are building as it faces a string of headwinds, from higher interest rates and work-from-home trends to tighter credit conditions.\n\nHigh borrowing costs and higher standards for obtaining loans -- part of the fallout from the turmoil that hit banks in March -- could raise hurdles for big property owners as they seek to refinance a pile of loans.\n\nNearly $450 billion in commercial real-estate debt is due to mature in 2023, per data cited from Trepp by JPMorgan. That means a final payment on those loans is scheduled to be paid before the end of the year.\n\nTo make matters worse, occupancy rates in offices across the country are still far from prepandemic levels, thanks to remote work trends -- and that\'s weighing on property valuations. That\'s sparking concerns that commercial property owners could ultimately default on their debt.\n\nTop market commentators and Wall Street banks have sounded the alarm on the commercial real-estate market. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management\'s top strategist has forecast prices could plunge as much as 40% from their peak, in a worse crash than the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAt the same time, Bank of America clients pulled $2.3 billion from US stocks last week, when the S&P 500 was down 0.1%.\n\n""Clients sold US equities (-$2.3B) for a second consecutive week, with outflows from both single stocks and ETFs (first ETF outflows since early March),"" the bank\'s strategists wrote.\n\nWhile the bank cited no reason for the exodus from US equities, the outflow likely reflects growing pessimism about the prospects for the S&P 500 over the past month.\n\nStock market veterans such as Jon Wolfenbarger have said the benchmark index has another 45% downside as investors are still blind to an impending US recession. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-real-estate-bofa-clients-yank-451-million-2023-4"

"Congress Urges DOJ To Review The Time Warner Discovery Merger Mess Amidst Chaos And Ongoing Layoffs The AT&T Time Warner and DirecTV mergers were a monumental disasters. AT&T spent $200 billion to acquire both companies thinking it would dominate the video and internet ad space. Instead, the company lost 9 million subscribers in nine years, fired 50,000 employees, closed numerous popular brands (including Mad Magazine), and stumbled around incompetently for several years before giving up.\n\nBut that was just the start.\n\nAfter its tactical retreat, AT&T spun off Time Warner into an entirely new company, Warner Media. Warner Media then immediately turned around and announced a blockbuster merger with Discovery, creating the creatively named Warner Brothers Discovery.\n\nThis new company has been a blistering mess as well. Executives there have been so cheap they\'ve refused to pay residuals to creators, shuttered numerous popular programs they didn\'t want to pay for, and engaged in round after round of additional layoffs to achieve promised ""synergies."" Hundreds of billions of dollars later and the end result is a shittier product and, well, chaos.\n\nIt\'s been a wonderful example of the blistering stupidity of the ""growth for growth\'s sake"" mindset, the perils of mindless consolidation, and our obsession with completely pointless megadeals that genuinely only benefit investors and higher level executives. Everybody else, from artists and employees to consumers, gets screwed in the form of layoffs, higher rates, or lower quality product.\n\nEnter Congress, where a teeny, tiny number of lawmakers think maybe somebody at the DOJ might want to at least review the approval process that helped create the deal. They\'re not calling for the merged companies to be broken up, though they are asking that the process that resulted in this dumb mess maybe inform future reviews:\n\n""We also hope that the competitive consequences resulting from the WarnerMedia-Discovery merger inform updates to the merger guidelines to ensure that the guidelines reflect the needs of workers, consumers and content creators in the media and entertainment industry,"" the letter said.\n\nThe letter was signed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform and Antitrust; Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas).\n\nOf course it won\'t. Nobody will learn anything from this process. Outside of baseball, massive pointless mergers are the top American pastime. There are just countless examples of how consolidation and monopolization through megadeals harms all of the things American policymakers claim to be dedicated to (free markets, free choice, competition, innovation, creating jobs).\n\nThis complete apathy to the harm of mindless consolidation occurs as countless folks in Congress make TV appearances claiming to support things like ""antitrust reform."" In part because it\'s happening in the less sexy media policy space, where regulators have effectively been defanged and issues often get overlooked given the current myopic DC fixation on ""Big Tech.""\n\nWhen it comes to taking media consolidation seriously, a small handful of Senators saying ""maybe somebody should do something about this"" is about as close to competency as it gets.\n\nFiled Under: antitrust reform, artists, creators, layoffs, megadeals, mergers Companies: warner brothers discovery https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/12/congress-urges-doj-to-review-the-time-warner-discovery-merger-mess-amidst-chaos-and-ongoing-layoffs/"
"Indiana lawmakers OK bill to allow over-the-counter birth control access Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nIndiana residents could have over-the-counter birth control access under a bill state lawmakers sent to the governor Tuesday, a move proponents say will prevent unwanted pregnancies in a state that passed an abortion ban last summer.\n\nThe state House bill is key to providing women quicker access to contraceptives, bill sponsor Republican Sen. Sue Glick said Tuesday, especially in areas where they struggle to receive primary care.\n\nGlick, who sponsored the state\'s abortion ban, called the bill ""a furtherance of the bills we heard this summer.""\n\n""We have individuals who have been referred to their primary physicians or to a primary physicians. Many of them don\'t go to the doctor, they can\'t afford it or they don\'t have access,"" she said before the 28-20 vote. ""This is an effort to give care to individuals who need it. It\'s an effort to help these individuals have healthy families at their time.""\n\nIf approved by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, pharmacists could be reimbursed for their services to Medicaid patients. They would also be able to object to prescribing the medications under ""ethical, moral, or religious grounds.""\n\nINDIANA MAIL-IN VOTING CRACKDOWN HEADED TO GOVERNOR\'S DESK\n\nPrescriptions, however, cannot last more than six months, and pharmacists cannot prescribe a contraceptive to a woman after twelve months ""unless the woman has been seen by a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant"" in the past year.\n\n""If you are against abortion, you ought to be for contraceptives,"" Republican Sen. Vaneta Becker said before voting for the bill.\n\nTo opponents who want birth control to only be prescribed by physicians, the bill is ""unequivocally lowering the standard of care,"" Republican Sen. Tyler Johnson said Tuesday. The emergency medicine doctor also questioned whether access to birth control would decrease abortions in Indiana.\n\nGOP Sen. Tyler Johnson, right, questions Sen.

(AP Photo/Arleigh Rodgers)\n\nState legislatures across the U.S. have introduced at least 30 bills related to over-the-counter birth control access this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy earlier this year signed a law that would allow women in the state to receive some hormonal contraceptives without a prescription. That law goes into effect in May.\n\nWhile the Indiana legislature seeks avenues for contraceptive access, the state\'s abortion ban remains on hold pending a decision from the Indiana Supreme Court. Abortion clinic operators filed a lawsuit against the ban, which has not been enforced since September.\n\nINDIANA REPUBLICANS LOOK TO DOUBLE DOWN ON MAIL-IN VOTER ID REQUIREMENTS\n\nBut the drive for pharmacist-prescribed birth control has cropped up in Indiana before this year -- most recently this summer, when Democratic Rep. Rita Fleming introduced an amendment with such language into a spending bill for low-income women and children that lawmakers advanced alongside the abortion ban.\n\nThat amendment fell short by one vote.\n\n""We were awfully close then,"" Fleming told the Associated Press on Tuesday. ""I think the good of providing this for women in a safe manner is incredibly important.""\n\nA House committee earlier Tuesday also unanimously approved a bill that could allow long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices, to be transferred between Medicaid patients, something that is currently prohibited.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf a Medicaid patient does not return for an insertion appointment after 12 weeks for a device they requested, a medical provider could reissue that contraceptive to a different patient, under the bill, which now goes to the full House.\n\nProviders do not typically keep the implant devices on the shelf because of their high costs, leaving ""thousands of dollars of these unclaimed,"" Democratic Sen.

Doug Burgum on Tuesday evening signed two transgender athlete bans into law, effectively prohibiting transgender girls and women from joining female sports teams in K-12 and college.\n\nLawmakers in the House and Senate passed the bills with veto-proof majorities this year. If the governor had vetoed the bills or refused to sign them, the bills likely would\'ve still become law.\n\nBurgum said in a statement that over the past two years, with more than 27,000 students participating in North Dakota high school sports, ""there still has not been a single recorded incident of a transgender girl playing or entering the process to even ask to play on a North Dakota girls\' team.""\n\nNevertheless, the Legislature has now ""resoundingly determined"" that restrictions beyond the current rules for girls\' sports should be codified in state law, he said.\n\nTRANSGENDER ATHLETE AND GENDER-AFFIRMING SURGERY BILLS SWEEP THROUGH STATE LEGISLATURES NATIONWIDE\n\nBurgum added: ""Concerns raised last session about such policies jeopardizing the ability to host regional and national collegiate tournaments have not materialized in the roughly 20 states that have passed similar legislation.""\n\nAt least 19 other states have imposed restrictions on transgender athletes.

Instead of using the regular dynamic speaker drivers in their headphones, Audeze uses the more expensive method of using thin sheets of material to vibrate and create a sound that some people much prefer to dynamic headphones.\n\nToday, Audeze has announced its lightest and most affordable full-size open-back headphones. Based on the company\'s highly successful MM-500 headphones, Audeze claims the MM-100 headphones deliver ""accurate, lifelike sound and easygoing comfort.""\n\nThe new MM-100 headphones use Audeze\'s 90mm planar-magnetic drivers, long championed by music lovers and audio professionals. The efficient and low-impedance drivers mean the MM-100 headphones are easy to drive using almost any audio source, whether a Digital Audio Player or a proper hi-fi system.\n\nAudeze has announced its lightest and most affordable full-size open-back headphones.\n\nThe headphones feature a newly designed chassis made from premium materials, including magnesium and aluminum.

"LinkedIn teams up with CLEAR on verification features LinkedIn is making it easier to prove you are who you say you are on your profile. The platform is adding new identity verification features that will allow users to confirm their name and employer, and it doesn\'t involve paid subscriptions or blue checkmarks.\n\nWith the update, LinkedIn is rolling out three ways its members can confirm their identity. The company is partnering with CLEAR -- yes, the same CLEAR that can get you to the front of security lines at airports and other venues -- to check that the name on your ID is the same as the one on your profile. The process is free but does require sharing a U.S phone number and government-issued I.D.\n\nLinkedIn is also offering a feature for verifying where you work that\'s a slightly less involved process. To confirm your employer, you\'ll need to enter a verification code sent to your company email address. In both cases, once the verification is complete, a ""verification"" field will appear on your LinkedIn profile that states what details have been verified.\n\nAlternatively, some users will be able to verify both their identity and employer at once via a partnership with Microsoft Entra, which creates workplace IDs for companies that enroll its program. LinkedIn says the Entra partnership will be rolling out at the end of the month to employees of the ""dozens"" of companies currently in the program.\n\nGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\'s editorial team.

The latest changes add a prominent ""verifications"" section that will appear directly under a user\'s profile details.\n\nNotably, the company is orienting its verification around confirming its members identities, rather than checkmarks or other specialized features. And, unlike Meta and Twitter, LinkedIn is opting to keep verification separate from its paid subscriptions. That also means that having a verified profile doesn\'t come with any additional advantages, at least for now. But it could offer an extra layer of protection for those wary of fake accounts, impersonators or other scammers. https://www.engadget.com/linkedin-teams-up-with-clear-on-verification-features-130029062.html?src=rss"
"How Long Does It Take for a Bank Account to Become Dormant? Using multiple bank accounts can be a good way to separate funds for different financial goals. However, if you forget about one of those accounts it could end up falling dormant. A dormant bank account is an account that registers no financial activity for an extended period of time. The amount of time that it takes for a bank account to be considered dormant can depend on the bank.\n\nFor help with your own banking needs, consider working with a financial advisor.\n\nDormant Bank Account Definition\n\nA dormant bank account is a bank account that has no financial activity occurring for an extended time period. Generally, a bank account may be ruled dormant if there are no new:\n\nACH transfers in or out of the account\n\nDebit card purchases\n\nAutomated transactions, such as preauthorized bill payments\n\nIn other words, leaving a bank account dormant means that it's sitting and doing nothing. A dormant savings account may continue to earn interest on the existing balance, but there are no new deposits being made.\n\nWhat kind of bank accounts can become dormant? Generally, any deposit account could fall into dormancy. That includes checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. Safe deposit boxes aren't necessarily excluded either, as your bank may consider your account dormant if your rental fees go unpaid for an extended period.\n\nIf you're ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nWhy Do Bank Accounts Become Dormant?\n\nThere are lots of reasons why a bank account may become dormant. Here are a few scenarios that can result in a dormant account:\n\nDeath of the account owner. A dormant bank account situation can happen when the owner dies and there is no beneficiary to claim it, or the executor overlooks it when completing their inventory of the deceased person's estate assets.\n\nChanging banks. You may leave a dormant account behind when changing banks if you're not taking steps to ensure the old account is properly closed. No new transactions may go through to the account but it's still technically open.\n\nForgetfulness. Sometimes, a dormant bank account is simply the result of someone forgetting that they have the account. For instance, you might open a new savings account and make an initial deposit, then let it slip your mind.\n\nDormant bank accounts aren't necessarily a bad thing. However, letting an account go dormant could lead to fees or worse, the loss of the funds in the account.\n\nHow Long Does It Take for a Bank Account to Become Dormant?\n\nBanks can define dormant accounts differently. For example, your bank account may be considered after six months with no activity of any kind at Bank A, while Bank B might not mark an account as dormant until 12 months or more have passed with no new transactions.\n\nIn terms of how long a bank account can sit dormant before the bank does anything about it, that can vary by the financial institution as well. After enough time has passed the account can be deemed unclaimed property.\n\nState law can dictate when a bank account is considered to be dormant and what happens to the money in it. A typical time frame is three to five years, though again, the rules can depend on where you live.\n\nWhat Happens When a Bank Account Goes Dormant?\n\nBank accounts don't just become dormant overnight. There are a series of things that need to happen first before the bank assigns accounts a dormant label.\n\nTypically, these are the steps:\n\nYou don't make any new deposits, withdrawals or other transactions to or from the account for a set time period, which can vary depending on the bank.\n\nThe bank deems your account to be inactive. At this point, the bank may begin charging a monthly or yearly inactivity fee.\n\nAfter additional time passes with no new activity, the bank can transition the account from inactive to dormant.\n\nAt this point, the bank can close the account. If there is no current contact information on file for you, the bank can send any funds in the account to the state. The money then becomes unclaimed property. All of this is allowed under state escheatment rules.\n\nHow to Retrieve Funds From a Dormant Bank Account\n\nIf money from an old bank account ends up in the state's hands, you have the right to try and get it back. Your state may have a specific process for doing so, but it may be as simple as filling out a form and paying any applicable fees.\n\nNot sure where your bank account went? Your state may offer an online unclaimed property database that you can use to search for old bank accounts. You can also search through national unclaimed property databases like MissingMoney.com or Unclaimed.org.\n\nOnce the state reviews your claim and approves it, you should get a check in the mail for the account balance, less any other fees that might apply. You could then put that money into an existing bank account or use it to open a new account.\n\nIf it's a large amount of money you might consider investing it instead. You can talk to your financial advisor about the best ways to use a forgotten cash windfall to further your money goals.\n\nHow to Avoid a Dormant Bank Account\n\nThe simplest way to avoid having a bank account go dormant is to make sure it's registering regular activity. You could do that by:\n\nScheduling a small recurring deposit to it each month from a linked bank account.\n\nMaking a once-monthly or once-quarterly withdrawal.\n\nUsing the account for a specific purpose, like paying a particular bill each month.\n\nLogging in to online or mobile banking to download your statements or update your contact information.\n\nIf you don't think you're going to use a bank account again, you may be better off closing it altogether. That way, you could avoid any inactivity fees the bank might charge if you're not using it. Remember to verify with the bank in writing that the account is closed.\n\nLetting a bank account go dormant may not be something you do intentionally, but it's important to know how to manage accounts that have fallen by the wayside. Waiting too long to reactivate a dormant account or close it down entirely could mean having to do a little more work to track that money down with the state later.\n\nConsider talking to your financial advisor about the best types of accounts to have to manage your money. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nIf you'd like to be able to combine banking with investing, you might consider opening a cash management account in place of a regular checking account. Cash management accounts combine features of checking accounts and savings accounts, and it's easy to open one at the same brokerage that holds your investment account or IRA. You can use your account to pay bills while earning interest on the money that you eventually plan to invest, or sweep in funds when selling investments in your brokerage account.\n\nPhoto credit:  iStock.com/damircudic,  iStock.com/RgStudio,  iStock.com/Moon Safari\n\nThe post What Is a Dormant Bank Account? appeared first on SmartAsset Blog. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/long-does-bank-account-become-130028748.html"
"Behind the Story: Free Speech Controversy at Stanford I spoke to Vimal, who covers higher education for The New York Times, about his reporting and how this incident fit into our current high-pitched political environment and understanding of free speech at universities nationwide. Here's our conversation, lightly edited:\n\nHow did you come to this story?\n\nI had kept an eye on the controversy ever since video of Steinbach's intervention on March 9 went viral. But the story snowballed from there. It became a major cause on the right, with prominent politicians like Ted Cruz and media personalities calling for Steinbach's firing. By the time Martinez responded with her extraordinary memo, I was already reporting.\n\nAs you've written, the issue of free speech on college campuses isn't a new one. Why did this particular incident garner so much attention?\n\nThe recorded remarks by Steinbach came at a time when diversity, equity and inclusion jobs are under attack from conservatives. Her intervention felt like a Rorschach test. What did you see? A D.E.I. dean expressing sympathy for students heckling a federal judge and also admonishing him? Or a deft administrator stepping into a challenging situation, calming students down and insisting they listen to the judge?\n\nMany people were quick to condemn Steinbach from the video. But when I actually started reporting, I found a much more complicated back story. I was surprised to hear that she had a good relationship with the head of Stanford's Federalist Society. And that Nadine Strossen, a free speech crusader, thought that she went out of her way to support free expression.\n\nWhat is it about this moment that brings such attention to campus free-speech issues?\n\nMany people who are frustrated that these flare-ups ricochet around the web say that controversial speakers deliver talks every day at universities, including law schools, without incident, and that we only hear about the events that go awry. That said, this is an emotionally charged and polarizing moment in U.S. history more broadly, and that's playing out on college campuses. Passions are especially escalated at law schools because so many of the country's biggest cultural divisions are legal issues. Roe v. Wade was just overturned. The fight for the rights of gay and transgender people, redistricting and even election-integrity claims all play out in courtrooms. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/us/stanford-law-free-speech.html"
"Biden administration will propose new privacy safeguards for women seeking abortions The US Department of Health and Human Services will propose a new rule on Wednesday, aimed at safeguarding privacy and prohibiting the prosecution of individuals who seek abortions.\n\nThe new rule proposal comes as Vice President Kamala Harris is set to convene an interagency taskforce meeting on reproductive rights at the White House. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will also attend.\n\nIn a call with reporters, senior administration officials previewed the notice of proposed rulemaking from the Biden administration, issued in response to a Texas federal judge\'s ruling late last week to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration\'s approval of medication abortion drug mifepristone.\n\n""Specifically, this NPRM proposes to strengthen privacy protections by prohibiting the use or disclosure of protected health information by regulated entities, such as health insurance plans, providers and others, specifically for a criminal, civil or administrative investigation into proceeding against a person in connection with seeking, obtaining, providing or facilitating reproductive health care where such health care is lawful under the circumstances in which it was provided,"" a senior administration official said.\n\nThe senior administration official called it a ""step further"" from existing guidance issued in the wake of the US Supreme Court\'s ruling last summer that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the right to an abortion nationwide. The current guidance, still in effect, protects HIPAA privacy rights by not requiring the disclosure of patient information under certain circumstances. But officials said they found that some providers would still ""get fearful,"" about following the guidance when subpoenaed.\n\nThis proposed rule, they said, providers further cover ""to not provide that information, if it\'s not for the specific purpose articulated in the role.""\n\nThe US Department of Education is also issuing guidance to remind over 20,000 school officials of their obligations to student privacy, according to a statement from the White House, among other new administration efforts.\n\nThe Biden administration is issuing these limited actions after the Texas ruling rocked the country last week. The minimal reach of the proposed rules and guidance illustrate the lack of options the administration can take to protect access to this abortion pill, should the ruling take effect and be pulled from the market. The Justice Department and the manufacturer of mifepristone have already appealed, asking the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to put on hold the judge\'s ruling that could make the drug unavailable nationwide starting Friday at midnight.\n\nBut before Wednesday, the White House had yet to outline what other steps it could take to secure its availability. The administration took similar limited steps to protect access to abortion after the Dobbs decision, but Friday\'s ruling set off calls from frustrated progressive Democrats for the FDA and Biden administration to ignore the ruling – a request that the administration has said would set a ""dangerous precedent.""\n\nA separate and conflicting abortion pill ruling in Washington on the same day, created arguably the most contentious and chaotic legal flashpoint over abortion access since last summer.\n\nThose rulings prompted a fresh scramble from administration officials, who had been bracing for the Texas ruling to come down, and officials convening behind closed doors to work through a response. After the decision dropped Friday, a senior administration official said the White House immediately began engaging allies on the next steps.\n\n""We\'ve had very close contact with the Hill with members both in the House and the Senate, and staff, with groups who are focused on abortion, women\'s groups, health care providers,"" a second senior official told CNN. ""We\'ve also been in close contact, of course, with allies on the state level, state legislators, attorneys general etc. And we will continue to do all of that.""\n\nHarris, in her remarks at the taskforce meeting on Wednesday, will reiterate President Joe Biden\'s pledge to fight the ruling.\n\nThe vice president, a third senior administration official said, will ""highlight the administration\'s unwavering commitment to protecting reproductive rights in the midst of a health care crisis.""\n\n""The vice president will also point out that this unprecedented decision is not only an attack on women\'s freedom to make decisions about her own body, but it also threatens our nation\'s system of drug approvals and the rights of Americans across the country who expect that a medication approved by the FDA and prescribed by their doctor will be available to them when they need it,"" the official continued.\n\nHarris has led the administration\'s response on abortion rights. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, she has hosted dozens of roundtable discussions about reproductive rights, including access to contraception and medication abortion, while meeting with state legislators across the country. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/privacy-safeguards-women-abortion-biden/index.html"

"Nvidia's $599 GeForce RTX 4070 is a more reasonably priced (and sized) Ada GPU Its specs have been thoroughly leaked for anyone paying close attention, but today Nvidia is making it official: It\'s launching its GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card for a starting price of $599. This GPU will be the cheapest way to buy into Nvidia\'s Ada Lovelace GPU family, which, in addition to better performance and power efficiency, gets you access to Nvidia\'s DLSS 3 upscaling and frame-generation features and hardware acceleration for AV1 video encoding. Cards will be available from Nvidia and other partners starting on April 13th.\n\nNvidia\'s Founders Edition card is significantly smaller than its RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs, with a relatively svelte dual-slot cooler that will easily fit into most PC cases. GPUs made by Nvidia\'s partners can (and will) be more expensive and physically larger, and some of them will also come with 8-pin PCI Express power connectors rather than the newer but somewhat controversial 12VHPWR power connector that Nvidia uses.\n\nThe RTX 4070 is $100 more expensive than the $499 starting price of the RTX 3070 and RTX 2070, which were $120 more expensive than the $379 starting price of the GTX 1070. Even accounting for inflation since 2016 ($379 in 2016 is roughly $475 now), it continues a tradition of bumping up the price for GPUs with the same relative position in Nvidia\'s lineup, something Nvidia partially (and not untruthfully) justifies by pointing out how much faster its modern graphics cards are.\n\nThe RTX 4070 shares a lot in common with the 4070 Ti, the GPU originally announced as the ""RTX 4080 12GB"" before being ""unlaunched"" and relaunched. They share the same AD104 GPU die, a smaller chip than the AD102 flagship used in the RTX 4090 or the AD103 used in the 4080 series. They also both use 12GB of GDDR6X memory on a 192-bit interface. The 4070 has fewer CUDA cores (5,888, down from 7,680), but the 4070 and 4070 Ti are a whole lot more similar than the 16GB and 12GB RTX 4080 cards would have been.\n\nThat 192-bit memory interface is narrower than the 256-bit interface used by the 3070 and 3070 Ti, which Nvidia has compensated for by adding 32MB of extra L2 cache to the 4070 (for a total of 36MB). That cache, plus much faster base and boost clock speeds, are the 4070\'s biggest improvements over the last-gen cards.\n\nThere\'s a lot to recommend the 4070 on paper. It\'s the first Ada Lovelace graphics card to launch for closer to $500 than $1,000, it\'s the cheapest way to buy into RTX 4000-series features, and it\'s at least possible to buy versions that will physically fit inside smaller computer cases. It also promises to be significantly more power-efficient than the 3070 and 3080-series cards it\'s replacing (and competing with, given how widely available new 3000-series GPUs still are).\n\nBut in terms of raw rasterized game performance, it doesn\'t look like quite as big a slam dunk as the 3070 did when it was released. That GPU could soundly beat the more-expensive previous-generation RTX 2080 and 2080 Super for less money while trading blows with the RTX 2080 Ti. Nvidia\'s performance numbers for the 4070 show it beating a 3070 Ti and either narrowly beating or narrowly losing to the 10GB version of the RTX 3080. That\'s not bad, especially if you can actually buy a 4070 for $599--the 10GB 3080 launched for $699, and it still sells for at least that much unless you\'re buying used or refurbished--but previous midrange GeForce cards have done a slightly better job of bringing last-generation flagship performance down to more reasonably priced PCs.\n\nNvidia is leaning on DLSS 3 and its AI-accelerated frame generation to make those numbers more impressive. This feature, you might recall from our RTX 4090 review, ""doubles"" your frame rate by creating one AI-interpolated frame for every frame that the GPU renders. DLSS FG works in concert with the typical ""super resolution"" upscaling feature that adds pixels to the image your GPU is rendering to make it look more detailed. The result can be a clean-looking, high-resolution, high-frame rate image rendered using just a fraction of the GPU performance that would be needed to render the same scene natively. Nvidia claims the RTX 4070 can be 1.4 times as fast as an RTX 3080 when DLSS FG is enabled.\n\nBut as we found in our RTX 4090 review, it tends to work best when your GPU is already pumping out reasonable frame rates, making imperfections in the AI-generated frames harder to perceive. In other words, it\'s a lot better at making a 60 fps image look like a 120 fps image than it is at making a 15 fps image look like a 30 fps image. DLSS FG can also add latency, making it harder to recommend for twitchy competitive first-person shooters, and it\'s compatible with a relatively narrow selection of games (though Nvidia\'s list of ""50-plus titles"" includes big names like Microsoft Flight Simulator, Diablo IV, and Cyberpunk 2077).\n\nOn AMD\'s end, we\'re still waiting for the RX 7000 series and the RDNA3 architecture to trickle down to cheaper GPUs, so AMD is fighting this battle with last-gen cards. A recent email from AMD, likely sent in anticipation of the 4070\'s release, played up the $579 and $649 MSRPs of the Radeon RX 6800 XT and 6950 XT. If you can\'t find a 4070 in stock for $599--and if you don\'t mind the lack of DLSS support and inferior ray-tracing performance--either is a plausible alternative to the 4070 for high-end 1440p to low-end 4K gaming.\n\nWe\'ll take a closer look at the RTX 4070 in a full review soon. https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/nvidias-599-geforce-rtx-4070-is-a-more-reasonably-priced-and-sized-ada-gpu/"
"NVIDIA RTX 4070 review: The new 1440p gaming leader Slowly, but surely, NVIDIA is making its 40-series GPUs more affordable. Now it\'s down to $599 with the new RTX 4070, a mid-range card focused on 1440p gaming. While it\'s $100 more than its predecessor\'s launch price, the fabulous RTX 3070, that card typically sold for more than $1,000 due to the supply chain crunch, scalpers and insatiable crypto bros. Based on what we\'ve seen from the 4070 Ti, NVIDIA\'s new cards are actually staying close to their retail price, which is great news for anyone itching for an upgrade.\n\nJudging from Valve\'s Steam hardware statistics, I\'d wager many gamers are waiting on the eventual RTX 4060 before giving up their old cards, especially if it ends up selling closer to $400. But based on my testing, the 4070 is still a solid choice for practical gamers who may wan to splurge a bit. It\'s fast enough to deliver excellent 1440p performance with ray tracing enabled, and it can even deliver solid 4K gaming in a pinch too. Even though it\'s noticeably slower than the $799 RTX 4070 Ti in most benchmarks, that may not matter much when you\'re actually in the heat of battle. (Just think of all you could do with that extra $200!)\n\nThe RTX 4070 features NVIDIA\'s new Ada Lovelace architecture, sporting 5,888 CUDA cores, a base clock speed of 1,920 MHz (boost to 2,475 MHz) and 16GB of GDDR6X RAM. The 3070, meanwhile, had the same amount of CUDA cores, but it was based on NVIDIA\'s older Ampere architecture. It could only reach up to 1,725 MHz and had 8GB of slower GDDR6 memory. Despite those differences, the 3070 still holds up well, so I wouldn\'t rush out to replace it anytime soon. But if you\'re still holding onto an RTX 20-series GPU or something older, the 4070 may be the GPU you\'ve been waiting for.\n\nWe received the RTX 4070 Founder\'s Edition card from NVIDIA, which basically looks like a shrunken down version of the 4080 and 4090. It feels like a premium card, with a sleek metal case, a bevy of heatsink fins and two large fans to deal with heat. It\'s also a two-slot GPU, like the 4070 Ti, allowing it to fit inside of smaller cases far better than the enormous 4080 and 4090. Port-wise, there are three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI. As with all of NVIDIA\'s recent cards, it also includes an adapter to connect two 8-pin PCIe power cables (a single PCIe Gen 5 cable will also work).\n\nGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\'s editorial team.

The difference, though, is that it supports NVIDIA\'s DLSS 3 technology, which can help speed up ray tracing performance by inserting AI-generated frames. I was particularly impressed by how well it handled Cyberpunk 2077: in 1440p with maxed out graphics and ""ultra"" ray tracing settings, it delivered a smooth 120 fps. The RTX 3070, in comparison, struggled to hold 75 fps with the same settings using the older DLSS 2, which doesn\'t use frame generation.\n\nControl, an older title that only supports DLSS 2, had a less dramatic performance bump with the 4070. While playing in 1440p with maxed graphics and all of its ray tracing settings flipped on, it reached 106 fps, compared to 90 fps with the 3070. Still, it\'s a bit of a shock to see a mid-range card scoring triple digit frame rates with all of the game\'s ray tracing features enabled (which includes reflections, shadows and debris). Not too long ago, Control used to humble the mightiest video cards. https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-review-the-new-1440p-gaming-leader-130010874.html?src=rss"
"How Virtex's 'CS:GO' VR Stadium Could Transform Esports Forever Virtex promises to put viewers on the ground, in the heat of the action, in \'CS:GO\' and ... [ ] \'Counter-Strike 2\'.\n\nThe quality of esports coverage gets slicker and more immersive by the year, and with it, viewer numbers are climbing worldwide. Last year\'s League of Legends Worlds attracted a peak of 5.1 million spectators, while events such as the ESL Pro League and Valorant Champions bring ever-improving global audiences. Still, it\'s one thing to watch players fight for glory from fixed cameras; it\'s another to stand on the battlefield alongside them, live, watching them duke it out from wherever you want to.\n\nThis exciting capability is being promised by Virtex. Today, the British-based company has unveiled its partnership with spectating and analysis platform Skybox, which will introduce both CS:GO and its soon-to-be-released successor, Counter-Strike 2, to the Virtex Stadium platform: the ""world\'s first-ever virtual esports stadium.""\n\nVirtex aims to give esports viewers an unparalleled spectator experience–one which, if done correctly, could fundamentally change the way people watch esports forever, and offer an incomparable edge over traditional sports coverage.\n\nNot only can users choose to see each round from a seat in the Virtex Stadium–they can ""take full control"" and jump into the map itself, seeing any duel, following their favorite player, or perching on their preferred viewpoint to take in a one-on-one finale.\n\nVirtex Stadium is the brainchild of co-founders Tim Mcguinness–a British former Echo VR player and streamer–and Christoph Ortlepp, a German tech entrepreneur. The pair met at a VR League Finals event in 2019, where Mcguinness had a very early prototype of his concept, with which he quickly convinced Ortlepp of its potential.\n\nSpeaking exclusively about his company, Mcguinness says that his stint as both an esports competitor and commentator, and attending huge industry get-togethers like ESL One and IEM Katowice, shaped his vision.\n\n""Going to all of these events, I realized over time how many community members and fans wanted to go [as well] but couldn\'t, for whatever the reason: cost, time off work, travel,"" says Mcguinness. ""Knowing this, and having worked with game engines for years, I quickly realized there was an opportunity to create something that bridged that gap between real-world stadium events and online broadcasts.\n\n""From here, we set out to build a virtual counterpart to the real thing but quickly realized–if we\'re building this thing in a 3D experience, and watching other 3D experiences like games, can we do more than just video?""\n\nFor Mcguinness and Ortlepp, this was ""categorically yes."" Mcguinness continues: ""What quickly followed was an experience that allows you to watch a game in a virtual stadium like you\'d watch a real sport in any real world stadium: happening live, right in front of you, in 3D, in real-time–something that\'s never really existed in this way before.""\n\nL-R: Virtex founders Christoph Ortlepp and Tim Mcguinness.\n\nVirtex was formed in 2020, taking its name from a play on the word vertex, which in the context of games and 3D content refers to the angular points of a polygon. Given the company\'s entire focus was on creating an immersive viewing experience, it was the best choice to Mcguinness.\n\nWhile CS:GO and Counter-Strike 2 certainly seem like the perfect fit for Virtex Stadium–to the degree you\'d be forgiven for thinking it was created specifically for them–the first game brought to Virtex was VR title Echo Arena, a game that owner Meta has scheduled to shut down on August 1st.\n\nHowever, long before this planned closure was first reported, Mcguinness and his team were already working on the next big thing. ""We always wanted to prove how we could bring any genre of game and deliver it in this sort of medium,"" he says, ""so for us, a complex and staple FPS title like Counter-Strike was really a perfect next step.""\n\nThis clearly resonated with external funders. Virtex Stadium has raised $5 million between an angel investment round and a seed round, attracting backers as diverse as Oculus\' first investor, Anorak Ventures; All Iron, the Spanish and U.K.-based tech fund that backed esports organization Team Heretics; and even FIFA World Cup winners Mario Götze and André Schürrle.\n\nA peek inside the Virtex Stadium.\n\nWith this investment, Virtex has doubled in size in 12 months and now employs around 25 people. The company still considers itself a passionate indie outfit, but it has big ambitions after working directly with Counter-Strike–something enabled by its cornerstone partnership.\n\nSkybox provides real-time data and 3D game recreations to Virtex Stadium that allow CS:GO gameplay to be viewed by spectators from all angles. Working with Virtex for the last year on the integration of Counter-Strike maps, Skybox has helped to ensure that key modes and tools, such as gameplay features and map control, function smoothly.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this wasn\'t a walk in the park. Mcguinness explains: ""This was not an easy project technically for both ourselves and the team at Skybox. Creating visual and gameplay parity across multiple game engines–Source, Source 2, Unity, Unreal–is a big task and one that we don\'t take lightly.\n\n""Trying to get a AAA game title working and working well when you are also rendering an entire stadium filled with hundreds of users all watching and interacting with the game in real time was a tall task.""\n\nAnother major hurdle was presented by content synchronization, ensuring that both video and 3D content were shared between all users in any given stadium within around one second of latency.\n\nVirtex promises the ability to follow the action as if you were in the game.\n\n""This is a rather difficult technical challenge, but solving it was absolutely necessary,"" says Mcguinness. ""Otherwise, we would have ended up with an experience where half the stadium jumps up to cheer for a goal and a kill, with the other half wondering what just happened due to any sort of delay, which can be over ten seconds on most video streaming services.""\n\nThese technical capabilities are now ironed out, and big steps have been taken to make the Virtex Stadium app as accessible as possible, bringing its unique experience to as many people as possible, whether they have the latest hardware or not.\n\nWhile built for Steam and Oculus–Virtex is a licensed partner of Valve–it is also OpenXR compatible, meaning it supports almost all PC VR headsets. Those without VR will also be able to run it on their PC in 2D like they would with any other desktop game.\n\nMcguinness hopes to keep expanding its reach. ""We\'re very interested in bringing the stadium experience to a variety of other hardware platforms including PSVR2, Oculus Quest 2, and other standalone devices,"" he says, ""but our big focus right now is definitely trying to make the current virtual stadium experience the best it can possibly be.""\n\nThe Virtex Stadium experience also pledges to go beyond watching CS:GO and Counter-Strike 2 battles. Fans will be able to explore a lobby area, a lounge bar, and a central hall. These have been designed as ""relaxed hangout spaces perfect for meeting with friends and other fans,"" where those willing to explore will find hidden games and interactions. There are also no local limitations, meaning Virtex Stadium lets fans watch live events alongside friends and family, wherever they\'re based.\n\nExtensive social areas will also be available within Virtex Stadium.\n\nVirtex is confident it\'s onto a winner–a feeling shared by Skybox. ""The Virtex guys have done an outstanding job at building out the Virtex Stadium over the past year,"" said Ethan Cooper, CEO of Skybox Technologies. ""We are proud that via the Skybox and Virtex partnership, fans can soon experience live Counter-Strike in a whole new way.\n\n""It\'s an exciting time for our respective companies, and we are looking forward to continuing our partnership with additional game titles and new experiences.""\n\nPlans are in the pipeline to partner with major tournaments such as CS:GO\'s world-leading ESL Pro League, though Mcguinness remains coy about what they may be. However, he says that Virtex is ""definitely in contact with all top esports organizers, teams, and publishers"" and the company is ""exploring options to bring future content at all levels into the Virtex Stadium experience.""\n\nMcguinness and his team are also exploring other top titles to bring into Virtex Stadium, as there are countless esports games they want to partner with–though this, too, is a matter of patience.\n\n""I definitely think we\'re excited to bring new genres of content to experience and continue to prove how we can take any game and present it in a really compelling way as part of a fully 3D experience,"" he concludes. ""[I] can\'t say much more at this time, but there are definitely some more exciting announcements coming later this year!""\n\nVirtex is actively looking for outside input to enhance its platform, so if you think you\'ve got what it takes, visit the Virtex Stadium website to find out how to become a beta tester. https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2023/04/12/how-virtex-csgo-vr-stadium-could-transform-esports-forever/"

"NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4070 comes with 12GB of RAM for $599 True to the leaks, NVIDIA has unveiled the standard GeForce RTX 4070 -- and it might hit the sweet spot, provided you're willing to accept the price hikes that have defined the RTX 40 lineup. The $599 desktop GPU is considered a successor to the RTX 3070 Ti and offers a similar 5,888 CUDA cores, but adds more RAM (12GB instead of 8GB), higher clock speeds (1.92GHz base versus 1.58GHz), more level 2 cache (36MB compared to 4MB) and greater floating point computing power (29 teraflops versus 22). At the same time, it reduces the typical gaming power consumption from 290W to 200W. Some games quickly ran into the 8GB ceiling of RTX 3070 variants, so the extra memory alone may have a significant effect.\n\nNVIDIA pitches the RTX 4070 as ideal for 1440p gaming at over 100 frames per second with ray tracing turned on, although you'll have to enable DLSS3 upscaling to hit that target. While many games don't support the feature yet (over 50 do so far), this might make it feasible to play big titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Spider-Man: Miles Morales at maximum visual detail without compromising on frame rates.\n\nThe RTX 4070 will be available tomorrow, April 13th, and will include a Founders Edition card from NVIDIA itself. In other words, the $599 price is more likely to reflect what you can actually buy. You might not have to pay extra for a vendor's factory-overclocked board or otherwise accept artificial markups.\n\nWhether or not the new GPU is a good deal depends on your perspective. NVIDIA sees the RTX 4070 as an upgrade path for users coming from a GTX 1080 or RTX 2070. You're paying similar money for a major leap in performance. It's also decidedly more affordable than the $799 RTX 4070 Ti. However, the new model still costs $100 more than the base 3070. Like it or not, the days of sub-$500 upper mid-range cards appear to be over in NVIDIA's world.\n\nGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget's editorial team.

"It's Time to Stop Arresting People for Trolling the Government After Robert Frese posted a nasty Facebook comment about a police officer in 2018, police obtained a warrant to arrest him. This was the second time in six years that Frese was charged with ""criminal defamation.""\n\nFrese does not live in Russia, China, Iran, or another country notorious for oppressive speech laws. He lives in New Hampshire, which criminalizes the act of purposely making a false statement that exposes someone ""to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule."" While Americans typically associate defamation with civil lawsuits, in which the alleged victim sues the speaker for money, many are unaware that, in some states, defamation is a crime that can lead to fines or jail time.\n\nCriminal defamation laws are a relic of England, the colonial era, and early America. The federal Sedition Act of 1798 levied fines and prison time on those who transmitted ""any false, scandalous, and malicious writing or writings"" against the government, and John Adams\' administration used it to prosecute dozens of critics. The federal law expired in 1801 after a critic, Thomas Jefferson, became president, but many states continued to prosecute their own criminal defamation laws.\n\nToday, New Hampshire and 13 other states still have criminal defamation laws on the books. While prosecutions under these laws were rare as recently as a few years ago, we\'ve seen disturbing examples of charges filed against citizens who criticize local government officials on social media. Worse, those officials often have unilateral authority to bring criminal defamation charges.\n\nFrese had his first brush with New Hampshire\'s criminal defamation law in 2012, after posting comments on Craigslist that accused a local life coach of distributing drugs and running a scam business. The local police arrested Frese and charged him with criminal defamation and harassment. He was fined $1,488, with most of it suspended.\n\nIn the 2018 case, Frese pseudonymously posted on the local newspaper\'s Facebook page that a retiring police officer was ""the dirtiest most corrupt cop that I have ever had the displeasure of knowing … and the coward Chief Shupe did nothing about it."" The newspaper deleted that comment, but Frese posted a similar comment accusing the police chief of a cover-up. After the police chief denied a cover-up, a detective determined that no evidence supported Frese\'s allegations about the retiring officer and filed a criminal complaint that resulted in an arrest warrant.\n\nAlthough the police department dropped its complaint after state officials determined there was insufficient evidence that he had made the statements with actual malice, Frese asked a federal judge to find New Hampshire\'s criminal defamation law unconstitutional, arguing that the threat of a third prosecution under the statute chills his speech.\n\nJudge Joseph Laplante declined Frese\'s request--not because he was particularly enthusiastic about the prospect of police arresting people for defamation, but because the US Supreme Court, in the 1964 case Garrison v. Louisiana, ruled that states can ""impose criminal sanctions for criticism of the official conduct of public officials"" provided that the government establishes the speaker made the false statements with ""actual malice,"" which means they knew the statement was false, or at least entertained serious doubts about its truth. This is a high bar, but even if the case ultimately fails, the mere prospect of facing arrest or being forced through a criminal prosecution in a hostile jurisdiction can freeze speech. https://www.wired.com/story/free-speech-internet-first-amendment/"
"Body Horror in the Age of Instagram Face This is probably the worst moment in human history to be ugly. Not that looking busted ever helped anyone; I\'m sure the hottest serfs in Prussia got better plots of land and the sexiest Mesopotamians landed extra hunks of goat at the feast. But now, in our overwhelmingly visual and virtual culture, the pressure to appear camera-ready has reached a new level of intensity. Cosmetic procedures are no big deal. Weight loss injections are a full-blown fad. People meet their partners by taking a glance at their photo and swiping yes or no. A long-running reality show\'s whole gimmick is that judges rank musical artists without seeing them, since it\'s so obvious to everyone that how we look determines how we\'re treated. The shrugging attitude so many people have toward beautifying body modifications have made homeliness feel downright antisocial. If it\'s easier than ever to change how you look, well then--why don\'t you look better, huh?\n\nThe dominant beauty ideal of this era is the Instagram face. Poreless, polished, Kardashianesque, it is at once almost within reach (give or take several syringes of filler and several thousands of dollars) and completely unattainable (nobody actually looks like they do on the internet, even Kim Kardashian). Instagram face seems a natural subject for contemporary body horror, in the same way that so many new slasher flicks are now set at Airbnbs. It\'s chilling on a conceptual level--conformity through consumerism, the commodification of self, and all that--but it\'s also a forthrightly gory, Cronenbergian undertaking. So many of the procedures, programs, and treatments undertaken to get this look involve needles, blood, hunger, and pain.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nTwo recent debut novels have tapped into the Gothic side of beauty and wellness culture, prime examples of a new literary trend: Goopcore body horror. Both stories follow women enthralled by Svengali-like figures who encourage them to take extreme measures to embody beauty standards, with horrific results. Allie Rowbottom\'s Aesthetica, released late last year, imagines a washed-up Instagram influencer in Los Angeles named Anna, who is preparing to undergo an experimental surgery called Aesthetica. She so yearns to return to a more natural form that she is willing to risk her life to recover an earlier version of herself.\n\nAesthetica opens on Anna in the present day, on the eve of her surgery. In flashbacks, we see how Anna gets her start as a social media star. She meets a slick himbo named Jake, who pays for her breast implants, insists that ""bad vibes had the potential to manifest bad realities,"" and pressures her into gigs where she\'ll be exploited and worse. Rowbottom captures the vapid ""DM for collab?"" vocabulary of the #spon set, which makes reading Aesthetica both an authentic and unpleasant aesthetic experience. (A representative excerpt: ""He drove, I sang \'Vegas Baby\' to the camera, and posted. 200 likes, 427, 600."" Ew!)\n\nFiltered through Anna\'s narrative voice, all the bodies in Aesthetica are appraised harshly, as though un-airbrushed flesh is automatically gross. Before her procedure, she is startled looking at her own ""dimples, ripples, reminders of masks and knives and wrist ties."" Her cancer-addled mother Naurene is ""yellow as an Easter egg"" when she\'s in the hospital; her old friend Leah has the ""furred"" forearms of an anorexic. She observes a group of strangers and thinks about what she would suggest they do to look better: ""Rhinoplasty, I diagnose when I look at one. Brow lift, I silently suggest for another. Buccal fat pad removal.""\n\nSome of the writing reminds me of K. Allado-McDowell\'s 2022 novel Amor Cringe, which was written with ChatGPT. Like Aesthetica, Amor Cringe also focuses on an influencer adrift in Southern California. Both novels use deliberately cringey language to convey the gale-force banality of this lifestyle. While Amor Cringe reads like a language experiment, Aesthetica has a heart beneath its layers of hyaluronic acid and silicon. https://www.wired.com/story/goopcore-body-horror-age-of-instagram-face/"
"The Story Of Mad Rabbit: Identifying A Pain Point In The Tattoo Industry Mad Rabbit Co-Founders, Oliver Zak and Selom Agbitor, are bringing innovation to the tattoo ... [ ] aftercare market.\n\nSince launching on the campus of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Mad Rabbit has changed the game in the tattoo aftercare market. They are doing so by bringing change to an industry that is thousands of years old but one that has been largely resistant to innovation until recently. I sat down with Oliver Zak, co-founder of Mad Rabbit, to talk about their journey, community-driven product development process and unique retail strategy that allows them to take a different approach to brand building.\n\nDave Knox: How did you come up with the idea for Mad Rabbit\n\nOliver Zak: My co-founder Selom and I got started in business during our sophomore year in college. Selom introduced me to the concept of e-commerce, and we spent the next six months exploring how to build a brand online. We began with dropshipping, which taught us valuable lessons about building a brand and differentiating ourselves through customer service and ambassador programs. We couldn\'t compete on product differentiation, but we learned how to succeed in other ways. After a few months, we sold that business for $7,000, which was a big win for us as college students. It showed us that we had a potential interest in pursuing this type of business further.\n\nDuring our senior year, we were between jobs and looking for a new opportunity. I had a tattoo appointment, and I was frustrated with the recommendations for healing tattoos. Most of them involved petroleum jelly, which I felt was outdated and unhealthy. I asked my tattoo artist if there were any natural alternatives, and there weren\'t. That\'s when Selom and I decided to create our own natural tattoo care products.\n\nWe ordered ingredients from Amazon and local apothecaries and began experimenting with different formulations. Our first product was an all-natural tattoo balm made with seven natural ingredients. We used it for aftercare, and it worked well. Through marketing these products with Facebook ads, and that summer alone, we were able to generate $300,000 in sales. We later in 2021, developed a soothing gel that was more specific for tattoo healing, which continued to skyrocket the brand. This success showed us that we had found a need in the industry and that we had a viable product-market fit.\n\nSelom and I learned a lot about building a brand through our dropshipping business. This experience helped us develop the skills we needed to create and market our own natural tattoo care products. We are proud to offer a safer, healthier alternative to traditional tattoo aftercare, and we are excited to continue growing our business.\n\nKnox: You launched both of those businesses while students at Miami University. What advantages did this give you to connect with your target audience?\n\nZak: Miami is not known for being a particularly tattooed school. However, it does have a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem that supports and champions startups. Selom and I were able to leverage this ecosystem to launch our natural tattoo care products business. Our recently launched college ambassador program focuses on metropolitan areas where tattoos are more prevalent. This has helped us reach a wider audience and build our brand.\n\nOne of the resources that helped us get started was a business fraternity that we joined freshman year. This speaks to the resources available on campus for those interested in entrepreneurship. Outside of my finance degree, which helped me learn the language of business, the biggest value add for Miami while I was there was definitely the entrepreneurial community of students, faculty, and alumni from the school of business. This vibrant entrepreneurial community that helped us launch our business. We are grateful for the resources and support we received from the Farmer School and the larger community, which helped us turn our idea into a successful business.\n\nKnox: What has been the driving force behind the success of Mad Rabbit?\n\nZak: I never thought I\'d be the tattoo guy, but I\'ve always been good at identifying areas of opportunity. I noticed that tattoos were becoming more popular, even though they\'ve been around for thousands of years. In 2012, only 20% of US adults had a tattoo, but now in 2023, it\'s closer to 50%. That\'s a lot of growth in a short period of time. This trend isn\'t just in the US, it\'s global. Japan and South Korea just legalized tattooing, and self-expression is being championed through tattoos.\n\nThe tattoo industry was ripe for disruption. It\'s historically been a cash-only, under-the-table business. There was never any formal training for tattoo artists, so you had to convince a shop to take you under their wing. This made it a pretty slow-to-adopt and exclusive community. Nowadays, there are tons of resources available online, and Mad Rabbit is passionate about helping aspiring artists.\n\nOur success at Mad Rabbit came from addressing a pain point in the industry. Tattoos don\'t always heal well, and a big reason for that is the recommendation of using petroleum jelly. It\'s great for scrapes and cuts because it helps build up a scab, which protects against bacteria and dirt. But it\'s terrible for tattoos because the ink gets stuck in the scabs, and when they fall off, your tattoo can look awful in week two. That\'s frustrating when you\'ve spent thousands of dollars and hours of pain on your tattoo.\n\nWe saw an opportunity to innovate and offer a better solution for tattoo aftercare. People resonated with our clean and natural tattoo care products because they worked, and they addressed a real problem. We\'re proud to offer a safer, healthier alternative to traditional tattoo aftercare, and we\'re excited to continue growing our business.\n\nKnox: Why did you decide go on Shark Tank and what\'s been the impact on the business since then?\n\nZak: I wasn\'t the one who applied to Shark Tank, it was actually my partner Selom. I grew up watching the show with my family every Friday since I was 13 years old. My dad is an entrepreneur, and I always knew that I wanted to do my own thing one day. So when we got the call that Shark Tank was interested, it was like a childhood dream come true.\n\nBeing on Shark Tank gave us access to a huge audience, even if they weren\'t necessarily our target customer. The people who watch the show aren\'t necessarily heavily tattooed, but they might have nieces, nephews, or grandkids who are interested in tattoos. That goes a long way for gifting during the holiday season and overall brand awareness.\n\nIt was an amazing experience, and we learned a lot from the sharks. We were able to secure a deal with Mark Cuban, who has been a great partner for us, and still is. He\'s been very supportive and has helped us navigate the retail landscape. We\'re grateful for the opportunity that Shark Tank gave us, and we\'re excited to see where Mad Rabbit goes from here.\n\nKnox: Since launching the original healing balm, you have expanded across multiple products. What drives that product innovation strategy in deciding something\'s the right product to launch under Mad Rabbit?\n\nZak: At Mad Rabbit, we\'re proud to say that a lot of our product ideas come from our community. We\'ve become an umbrella for a bunch of different subcultures who are passionate about wearing their hearts on their sleeves. We have surfers, chefs, hairstylists, tattoo artists, and more. All of these people are brought under the Mad Rabbit umbrella, and they connect on things like sharing tattoos, best tips and tricks.\n\nMost excitingly for us, we get to leverage conversations between the brand and our consumers. Most of our products have actually come from ideation within our online communities. They\'ve asked for soaps, lotions, and other products, which is really exciting because it extends beyond the aftercare period. We\'re able to focus on daily care and maintenance, which is really important for long-term care of tattooed skin.\n\nA lot of the CPG giants out there are formulating for the mass consumer, and until the number of US adults with at least one tattoo passes 51%, they don\'t see it as a market worth formulating for. But we\'re small and nimble, and we listen to our customers. We can ideate and innovate accordingly.\n\nOnce we have those ideas, we move on to the prototyping and product development stage. We get samples from our chemist and our manufacturer. And then one of our final checks is with Dr. Elliot Love, who is on our advisory board. He\'s a tattooed dermatologist and skin cancer surgeon. He\'s a strong point of authority that we\'re able to leverage from a scientific ingredient perspective to put the cherry on top, if you will.\n\nKnox: Your retail strategy is also unique in that you sell not only through direct to consumer but also places like Urban Outfitters, GNC, and tattoo shops across the country. What led you to this strategy versus chasing a mass retailer initially?\n\nZak: We definitely want to be wherever our customers want to buy us, including mass retailers. But our initial strategy was direct-to-consumer online only, through Shopify, Facebook, and Amazon. That\'s how we reached our million customers today.\n\nOnce we gained some brand awareness, we started launching in ""brand accretive"" retailers, like Urban Outfitters. Many of our customers are under 35 years old living in metropolitan areas are passionate young people, which is exactly Urban Outfitters\' customer base.\n\nWe also saw an opportunity in the health and wellness industry. Health fans care about what they put in and on their bodies, and they want their tattoos to look good too. That\'s why GNC saw a great opportunity for us to expand beyond supplements and into skincare.\n\nThe tattoo parlor channel is really important for us. It\'s point of care, billboard space. We sell aftercare products where they\'re needed and when they\'re needed, and most importantly, we get the artist\'s recommendation on our side. The tattoo artist is the authority on how to heal a tattoo, so winning over their recommendation is crucial.\n\nWith the tattoo industry approaching 51% of US adults having at least one tattoo, the artist is really the bread and butter for us. We also have the opportunity to sell in other fragmented retailers like surfers, skateboarders, chefs, hair stylists, and barbers. Tattoos are the common link that can sell across various channels.\n\nKnox: With your recent Series A funding from Lucas Brand Equity, what are the plans for the business as you bring in this funding?\n\nZak: Part of the funds we raised are for building out our boots-on-the-ground sales team. There are about  30,000 tattoo parlors in the US, and it\'s a really important space for us to win over. We\'ve always been a strictly digital brand, so building a big sales team is a new venture for us.\n\nWe\'re also looking to up our content production. We\'re opening a headquarters in Los Angeles this spring/summer that will serve as a content-enabled tattoo studio. Our pro team artist will be tattooing there, capturing 360 content, and providing product testimonials. We\'re also giving them a space to record and grow their own personal brand, which is an exciting opportunity for us to empower them and provide mutual value.\n\nLastly, we\'re focusing on additional product development. Most of our products today are consumer-facing, but we\'re working on innovations that will give the artist a better tattoo experience. This will go a long way in winning over their recommendation for aftercare and daily maintenance. https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveknox/2023/04/12/the-story-of-mad-rabbit-identifying-a-pain-point-in-the-tattoo-industry/"

"Lead From Anywhere: Four Useful Routines For Hybrid Team Leaders Barry Rosen is CEO, Interaction Associates, leading provider of training & consulting services to build a collaborative leadership culture.\n\nIn 1903, Frank Lloyd Wright designed an administrative building for the expanding mail-order conglomerate Larkin Soap Company. Wright introduced many innovations, like central air conditioning, built-in desk furniture and suspended toilet partitions. The iconic architect also re-imagined the typical office building\'s physical layout so workers could connect, converse and collaborate more easily.\n\nMore than a century later, business leaders are grappling with how to configure office arrangements in the hybrid workplace, where team members are geographically distributed and rarely connect in person. According to Gallup, 56% of full-time U.S. employees say they can do their jobs from anywhere, and 60% of employees want to make hybrid work a permanent workplace fixture.\n\nWhile many excellent digital tools provide team members easy access to information and virtual access to each other, many leaders are less equipped to facilitate the people and process sides of hybrid team collaboration. It\'s common to worry about employee productivity, spend endless hours in virtual meetings and be uncertain about innovation. However, by understanding the characteristics that make an effective hybrid team, leaders can cultivate successful teams that contribute to thriving companies.\n\nWith that in mind, here are four routines that can help you become a more effective hybrid leader in the year ahead.\n\nMost leaders understand the need to measure success through the lens of whether or not your team is achieving expected and measurable results. But hybrid team leaders should also set expectations for and measure two additional dimensions of success: ""How effective are our routine team processes (e.g., decision-making and communication),"" and, ""How satisfying are our collegial relationships?""\n\nFor example, many hybrid workers feel isolated and disconnected from their peers, and more extroverted people especially suffer from physical separation from their co-workers. As the Harvard Business Review (registration required) explains: ""Employees with close connections at work are more productive, creative, and collaborative. They also report being more satisfied with their job, are less susceptible to burnout, and are less likely to leave their organization to pursue another role.""\n\nDeeper thinking and analysis are required to measure the productivity and relationship success of those working from home. It\'s often harder to measure team member productivity when managing from a distance. That\'s why it\'s more important to take the time to define and align with all your team members\' key performance area measures. Assess how much physical togetherness individuals and teams require to share information, problem-solve and perform effectively. At the same time, create opportunities for teams to build meaningful relationships and personal connections online that occur organically in the workplace.\n\nOnline meetings can be a drag on employee morale and productive capacity. Explaining the challenge for hybrid teams, The Washington Post succinctly reports: ""Pre-pandemic, white-collar workers felt meeting exhaustion. Then came Zoom fatigue. Now, they\'re experiencing a bit of both, sometimes at the same time."" However, online meetings will be a collaborative imperative moving forward.\n\nThere are several ways hybrid leaders can make the most out of online meetings. First, write down and send out desired meeting outcomes in the meeting invitation. Invite only people who are required to achieve the desired outcomes. Explain how decisions (if any) will be made.\n\nAdditionally, limit your regular 30- or 60-minute meetings to 25 and 50 minutes, respectively. This practice will help you and your team members relax and stretch for a few minutes before joining their next meeting or returning to individual tasks.\n\nTeam operating agreements establish clear expectations for how team members communicate and collaborate. They help everyone honor commitments, avoid misunderstandings and build trust. It\'s the hybrid leader\'s responsibility to initiate and facilitate operating agreement discussions. Important areas of agreement include expected response times to questions, requests and proposals; guidelines for feedback exchange; access to information; and schedule transparency.\n\nHere are a few ways that leaders can build agreements in real time:\n\n• List proposals, or ask team members to each send you one proposal before the meeting.\n\n• One proposal at a time, check for understanding and clarify as needed.\n\n• One proposal at a time, check for agreement between meeting members to help ensure that agenda points become operational priorities.\n\n• If there is no agreement, add or remove pieces of the proposal.\n\n• Check again for understanding and agreement.\n\nBy establishing practical team operating agreements, hybrid leaders can empower their teams to be more collaborative, communicative and effective moving forward.\n\nHuman beings are social creatures. We have a built-in aptitude for collaboration. However, not unlike developing our body muscles, it takes practice to hone our collaborative strength. It\'s the hybrid team leader\'s responsibility to provide team members with training and coaching to develop their collaboration muscles, including how to really listen, make a clear proposal, facilitate an agreement, bridge differences and exchange helpful feedback.\n\nHybrid team members also often require training and coaching on how to work independently, manage their time and integrate self-care into their daily routines. These soft skills are essential for work-from-home team members to manage their workload, be good team members and stay satisfied.\n\nHybrid work arrangements are here to stay. To build and maintain successful hybrid teams, team leaders can kick-start a ""build back better"" initiative by implementing the four routines outlined in this article.\n\nMeasuring success across three dimensions gets everyone on the same page, and mastering the online meeting allows leaders to role-model purposeful and productive collaboration. The process of building practical team operating agreements can help equip team members with the language and habits needed for conscious collaboration. And by cultivating team member collaboration skills, hybrid leaders can empower all their team members--regardless of their physical location--to take initiative and get things done from anywhere.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

"Where Are AVs Heading Next? Corey Clothier is the Founder & Director of Stantec GenerationAV .\n\nLike virtually every emerging industry, the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry has seen its share of ups and downs. Following the news of multiple AV developers shutting down over the past year, there's been quite a bit of commentary painting an uncertain future for the AV industry.\n\nTo put it frankly, this is very misleading. While some areas (the robotaxi market, for instance) are experiencing development and commercialization challenges, other AV markets are ramping up. The truth is, viewed in its entirety, we are seeing the AV industry continue to strengthen over time.\n\nThe AV industry is adapting and diversifying across many sectors, and we are seeing many successful projects pop up--just maybe not in the places that people were expecting. In addition to the often-discussed public transit sector, we're seeing significant use cases and progress in airports, delivery and freight.\n\nThe aviation industry should be getting more attention on its AV adoption. Airport operators are getting very serious about AV use cases, and we are starting to see airports adopt AVs for a variety of tasks. From ground handling to passenger movement and soon security roles, AVs will have an increasing role at airports and airfields.\n\nThe need to do more with less is driving this momentum. Labor shortages have impacted airports across the U.S. and are projected to have an impact on airport operations. In addition to increased passenger volume, airports are dealing with challenges filling positions--and long hiring and training processes when they do fill positions. On top of that, airports (like many entities around the world) are dealing with monetary constraints. It's the perfect storm for AV solutions.\n\nAs airports continue to grow and replace old systems with new ones, AVs are now a prime consideration. Among the first to adopt this technology at an airport is South Carolina's Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP). GSP is deploying electric autonomous shuttles as an automated transit network (ATN) to provide transportation to parking. This system is an updated version of London Heathrow Airport's 10-year-old automated personal rapid transit system.\n\nWith so many potential applications, the state of Michigan's Office of Future Mobility and Electrification has teamed with Gerald R. Ford International Airport and Southwest Airlines to provide the space and expertise to pilot new airport tech. We're part of a core team of innovators who will seek out and test new systems guided by an airport advisory council of 15 airport leaders from the U.S., Canada and Australia, piloting a variety of autonomous and other emerging technologies to see which will have the most impact on their efficiency of operations.\n\nThis approach benefits both the airport and the technology company, giving both sides real-world exposure as they look to test and find the right fit. Autonomous applications at airports to keep an eye on include cargo and luggage movement, people movement (landside, airside and in terminals), perimeter and parking security patrol, airside inspections, and even grass cutting.\n\nAs airports update their infrastructure, technology and staff training protocols to accommodate AVs, we expect to see their widespread utilization at airports across the world.\n\nIf we look at the freight sector, we see that the use cases suitable for automated driving are rapidly expanding. Mining, construction, agriculture and similar industrial operations are all seeing an uptick in their use of AV trucks. We're seeing logistics centers adopt automated trucks to help automate and streamline the process of moving trailers and containers between loading docks and on-site storage areas within the facility.\n\nFor example, we're working with Highland Fairview on the recently announced World Logistics Center (WLC) in Southern California. The largest net-zero freight hub of its kind, the WLC already has plans to integrate automated trucks across the 2,600-acre development, recognizing the trucking industry's position to be one of the first to break through on AV technology.\n\nComing back to the issue of labor shortages, the logistics and shipping industries have been hit considerably hard, with the ongoing truck driver shortage widely seen as one of the largest logistics bottlenecks post-pandemic. The American Trucking Associations estimated that the U.S. trucking sector was short 78,000 drivers in 2022, only down a few thousand from the record-setting shortage in 2021 of over 80,000.\n\nAVs are uniquely poised to address this shortage. One application seeing demand and growth is automated yard trucks. In this use case, a distribution center may operate dozens of yard trucks to move trailers around their campus. This automation frees up human drivers for other jobs and routes while improving safety and efficiency within the entire system.\n\nThere is also still quite a bit of room for the growth of trucks operating on public roads that can move trailers and containers from distribution centers, seaports and warehouses to local stores and facilities. I believe this is a perfect example of an area where AVs will continue to grow.\n\nAll in all, the future for AVs is brighter than ever before. While they may not be parked in your garage anytime soon, it's safe to expect adoption to continue to grow. With the proper mindset, infrastructure and planning, AVs can bring solutions that make our transportation system safer, more efficient and more sustainable.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

"How Spotify's RapCaviar Playlist Became A Must-See TV Series Spotify\'s first TV show RapCaviar Presents.\n\n""The way that we present playlists is pretty much a collection of 50 songs, and that\'s it. There\'s no context. We\'re not even able to articulate to the listeners why we picked those songs. So I\'ve been working on building channels that serve as an extension of RapCaviar\'s editorial voice.""\n\nThat\'s a problem that perhaps only Carl Chery has. He\'s the man in charge of RapCaviar, Spotify\'s most popular and important genre-specific playlist. Millions of people subscribe to the weekly ranking of some of the hottest new tracks in hip-hop, and inclusion on it can turn an unknown into a viral star in no time.\n\nBut while RapCaviar has a near-unprecedented reach and level of respect in the hip-hop field, it\'s not built for telling stories. It\'s perfect for delivering future hits to eager consumers, but that isn\'t enough for the former journalist and music aficionado.\n\nIn late March, Spotify and Hulu officially launched the music streamer\'s first TV show, a docuseries titled RapCaviar Presents. The six-part miniseries is primarily made up of episodes that focus on rappers of note–Tyler, the Creator, City Girls, Roddy Ricch, Polo G and Coi Leray–using them and their fame to shine a light on issues facing the community, such as social media bullying, the body shaming of women, and the breaking of hyper-masculine ideals.\n\nChery began to conceive of what would become RapCaviar Presents more than four years ago with a team at Spotify shortly after he joined the streamer in 2018. While some companies would be hesitant to do almost anything with such a strong brand, he insists he was given near-free rein to expand its portfolio and try something new. During a call just before RapCaviar Presents premiered, Chery explained that when he approached Spotify\'s Head of Music Jeremy Erlich with his bold idea, ""It wasn\'t even a pitch. It\'s just basically like, I want to do this,"" and that was enough.\n\nFrom there, Chery teamed up with nonfiction production company IPC to reshape the premise and get it ready. After a few months of editing and reimagining, the show was pitched to several networks and streamers–a streaming company pitching other streaming companies, how modern–and Hulu snapped it up in 2019. From there, a pilot was shot…and then reshot, as the program was altered even further into what viewers can see now on their TV.\n\nEli Hoffman, IPC\'s CEO, said that Chery brought him ""an embarrassment of riches"" when it came to talent, and he\'s right. In addition to the artists who are the focus of each episode, fellow musicians like Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B, Doja Cat, Jack Harlow and countless others provide commentary and insight into the fast-paced world of hip-hop. But it wasn\'t star power that was the problem when it came to actually creating RapCaviar Presents.\n\n""How do you make something that\'s so inside, that\'s so immediate that the purists and the experts will feel satisfied and not talked down to or like they\'re getting yesterday\'s news…but on the other hand, how do you please those purists without making something really inaccessible for a broader audience,"" questioned Hoffman during a video interview about RapCaviar Presents. ""That was always going to be the challenge.""\n\nSomehow, Chery, Hoffman, and the entire team at both companies pulled it off. RapCaviar Presents works for anyone with an interest in hip-hop…and should anyone who doesn\'t care for the genre give it a go, they\'ll get something out of it as well. The show humanizes musicians who put on a tough facade, it educates even those who think they know everything about rap, and it shows so many sides to the industry that even those working within it might come away shocked.\n\nThe brilliance of the program really comes from the musicians themselves, who open up in ways they might not even dare to do in their own music. ""It takes enormous confidence as an artist to allow your story to be told in that context, mid-career or early career,"" Hoffman explained, adding, ""We wish that every one of our stars had the sort of confidence to just let it all hang out there, but that\'s extraordinarily rare.""\n\nChery underlined just how amazing it was to see artists at the top of their game bare their soul for the camera, as ""in this day and age, everyone wants to curate their appearance."" He\'s right, but in a way, these rappers and singers sharing their innermost demons and struggles might be exactly that–their way of owning their own stories, their own narratives. ""We all have such a good barometer for what\'s real and what\'s canned now,"" Hoffman opined, ""so authenticity and sincerity really bond us to the artists we admire most.""\n\nIn less capable hands, RapCaviar Presents could have been just another run-of-the-mill informational docuseries, and it still would have achieved many of the goals that Chery set out to accomplish...but that wasn\'t enough for them. ""We wanted to be a little bit more ambitious than just some standard run of the mill bio format,"" Hoffman shared. Thankfully, that\'s exactly what they created–something special, and something not often seen coming out of the hip-hop space.\n\nAll six episodes of RapCaviar Presents premiered on Hulu on March 30, and while everyone involved has ideas for more, it\'s a bit too early to tell if a second season will be produced. For now, the show can entertain and inform both ""rap nerds and casual music lovers""–Chery\'s words–as one of the best music docuseries to come along in some time. https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2023/04/12/how-spotifys-rapcaviar-playlist-became-a-must-see-tv-series/"
"Overture Maps Foundation pre-releases collaboratively-built map dataset as shared asset for location-based apps The Overture Maps Foundation, a community-driven initiative to create an open map dataset, has unveiled a pre-release of its latest iteration.\n\nThe release showcases new features planned for integration into previous open-sourced releases. The updated map data now includes over six million building heights across 34,000 square miles in major U.S. cities such as Boston, Chicago and Santa Clara. This data was developed through a combination of efforts using several sources: the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 3D Elevation Program; building footprints from OpenStreetMap; Microsoft open building footprint data; and community sources.\n\nThe foundation\'s goal is to build a map dataset that caters to the needs of map service providers in an evolving mapping market.\n\n""The new data will support thousands of mapping and location-based applications, unlocking many new use cases,"" said Marc Prioleau, head of business development, mapping and location at Meta, who is involved in the project. ""This release in April is the first output from the project, whose work began in January. This is not a production release; it is intended to demonstrate the types of data Overture plans to build.""\n\nAWS, Microsoft, Meta and TomTom launched Overture in December under the Linux Foundation. The intention is to build a community of companies, government agencies and other parties that collaboratively build high-accuracy, high-fidelity open map data as a shared asset that anyone can use for location-based applications.\n\nThe results should include a common, well-structured data schema to help make maps easier to use, and a global entity reference system to link entities from different datasets to their corresponding real-world entities.\n\nThe data provides a glimpse into the power of combining resources from the public and private sectors to build new and unique datasets.\n\nThe latest data also includes new open map data sources from Microsoft ML buildings, additional building heights, and added administrative-area translations. Overture Maps Foundation aims to integrate all these open data sources into a cohesive and easily usable set of data.\n\n""In the April release dataset, we used building footprint data, aerial LiDAR data and a digital elevation model to infer building heights,"" said Prioleau. ""These heights can then be added to the building footprints to create a rough 3D shape. The benefit of this method is scale; it can be used to add 3D shapes to millions of buildings across the U.S. (or anywhere with the necessary open datasets). Individual buildings can then be edited with more detail as needed.""\n\nOverture engineers used building footprints from Microsoft and OpenStreetMap to identify buildings\' locations. They then looked at the USGS 3DEP LiDAR data to get the absolute elevations of those buildings\' rooftops and subtracted the local ground elevation to get the building heights.\n\nThe core dataset in the April release is the Daylight Maps Distribution v 1.25 of OpenStreetMap (OSM). OSM is a worldwide crowdsourced map that millions of individual mappers around the world continuously update. It changes every minute as new features are mapped or corrected.\n\nThe foundation has implemented commercial-grade quality checks and multiple validation checks to ensure the data is error-free, stable and easy to use. Overture aims to expand on these quality checks to further enhance the data\'s usability.\n\n""The Daylight Maps Distribution of OpenStreetMap is a monthly release of OSM data that has been put through approximately 60 quality validation checks. As new data is added or edited, these checks ensure that the map does not break,"" said Prioleau. ""The system also checks for profanity and vandalism that individuals can sometimes introduce in a crowdsourced process. All of the results are documented in release notes that go with each new version of Daylight.""\n\nMap service providers can now enjoy a more streamlined and predictable experience when using Overture\'s data, all thanks to the brand-new data schema and global entity reference system. This innovative system allows additions of supplementary data to the map, increasing accuracy and adding context.\n\nThe data schema uses a standard data model to create software that can render data into maps, develop local search and navigation applications, and create data visualizations. The schema also informs developers on how the data is structured and organized, allowing them to build their software accordingly.\n\nThe global entity reference system provides a way to accurately integrate other spatial data into the map. For example, logistics companies can estimate precise delivery ETAs by adding real-time traffic data to roads, while restaurants, bars and other businesses can build richer profiles by adding social data such as reviews, pictures and ratings.\n\nThe system can even append temporary data such as road closures or construction to affected locations, providing a real-time snapshot of mobility within the city.\n\nThis rigorous schema not only offers developers clear structures, it is also extensible, able to accommodate new types of map data as they emerge. In essence, the new data schema and global entity reference system enable map service providers to offer users more accurate and comprehensive maps.\n\nOverture intends its models to address the challenges inherent in building cooperation across many entities. ""There is very strong market interest in building an open map dataset that can be a shared asset for all companies,"" explained Meta\'s Priloeau. ""The costs and complexity of building the quality of map data expected by users have grown beyond the capabilities of any one company. That strong interest and alignment give the motivation to overcome challenges. By building Overture Maps within the Linux Foundation, we learned the best practices from the leading open-source collaborations.""\n\nIn future releases, the foundation plans to introduce a structured data schema that will simplify the use of maps, and a global entity reference system that will link different datasets to real-world entities.\n\nOverture acknowledges the challenges ahead but is optimistic about the progress it has made and the potential for growth. The foundation\'s ultimate goal is to build an open map dataset that anyone can use and that will expand the usability of location as a critical part of the world\'s shared infrastructure.\n\n""In the near future, by further collaboration through information and resource sharing, the map data will be more accurate, more complete and more up-to-date than it could be if any single entity developed it,"" Prioleau added. ""By sharing a common spatial framework, services can interact and interoperate with each other, rather than being confined to one mapping service or another.""\n\nFor those interested in learning more or contributing to the project, the foundation encourages feedback and welcomes new members to help build the open map dataset of the future.\n\nVentureBeat\'s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.

"The NYPD Is Bringing Back Its Robot Dog An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: The New York Police Department is reenlisting Digidog, the four-legged robot that the city faced backlash for deploying a few years back, as reported earlier by The New York Times. NYC Mayor Eric Adams announced the news during a press event on Tuesday, stating that the use of Digidog in the city can ""save lives."" Digidog -- also known as Spot -- is a remote-controlled robot made by the Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics. It\'s designed to work in situations that may pose a threat to humans, helping to do things like perform inspections in dangerous areas and monitor construction sites. However, Boston Dynamics also touts its use as a public safety tool, which the NYPD has tried in the past. City officials say that the NYPD will acquire two robot dogs for a total of $750,000, according to the NYT, and that they will only be used during life-threatening situations, such as bomb threats. ""I believe that technology is here; we cannot be afraid of it,"" Mayor Adams said during Tuesday\'s press conference. ""A few loud people were opposed to it, and we took a step back -- that is not how I operate. I operate on looking at what\'s best for the city."" The Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), a group that advocates against the use of local and state-level surveillance, has denounced Mayor Adams\' move.

"Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Vs RTX 3080 And RX 6800 XT: Which Should You Buy? Today we can finally reveal performance numbers for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 - it's cheapest RTX 40-series card to date - which will retail from $599, putting it in direct competition with Nvidia's own RTX 3080 and AMD's Radeon RX 6800 XT.\n\nThe card has a heavily trimmed specification compared to the RTX 4070 Ti, with a lower peak boost frequency, 5,888 versus 7,680 Cuda cores, 184 versus 240 Tensor cores and 46 versus 60 RT cores.\n\nBoth cards have a 192-bit memory bus and 12GB of GDDR6X memory, but the 49MB of L2 cache in the RTX 4070 Ti dwarfs the 36MB in the RTX 4070. The benefits, though, mean a much cheaper, smaller and less power-hungry graphics card - the RTX 4070 will retail from $599, has a cooler just 243mm/9.5in long and a board power of 200W versus 285W.\n\nWhile it shares some specifications with the RTX 3070, the latter was $100 cheaper, so we are dealing with a small price hike here. Still, this is by far the cheapest RTX 40-series graphics card so far and one that looks set to be pitched against most resolutions out there, especially as it supports DLSS 3.0 and frame generation and should offer better performance in DLSS and ray tracing in games than the RTX 3080 too.\n\nI used an Intel Core i9-12900K, 32GB of Kingston Fury 6400MHz DDR5 memory strapped to an NZXT N7 Z790 motherboard along with the latest drivers and Windows 11 updates. As the RTX 4070 is likely to face 1080p, 1440p and 4K resolutions, despite its relatively hefty price, I've also included 1080p benchmarks below, but only with specific graphics cards, namely the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT, with these being the closest models in price, and also the RTX 3070, which is its direct predecessor to see how much things have moved on in one generation.\n\nHalo Infinite's campaign mode saw the RTX 4070 dominate the RX 6800 XT and RTX 3070 at 1080p, but closely match the RTX 3080, living up to Nvidia's claims that the two cards perform similarly. Stepping up to 1440p and the gap surprisingly widens with a great result for the RTX 4070, which even beat the RX 6950 XT and traded blows with the RX 7900 XTX too. At 4K, it fell back passed both those cards, trading blows with the RTX 3080, but still bettering AMD's RX 6900 XT and 6800 XT.\n\nIn Flight Simulator, the RTX 3080 had a small lead at 1080p, was a touch slower overall at 1440p and about level at 4K, with the RX 6800 XT sitting below the RTX 4070 in all three resolutions. With DLSS enabled, the RTX 4070 edged out in front of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3080 Ti, with a big lead over the RX 6800 XT.\n\nAt 1080p, the RTX 4070 was a little slower than the RTX 3080, but noticeably quicker than the RX 6800 XT. A similar picture was a revealed at 1440p, except here it managed to better AMD's RX 6950 XT too, although the RTX 3080 edged out a bigger lead. At 4K the card struggled, only bettering the RX 6800 XT, with the RX 6900 XT, 6950 XT and RTX 3080 all managing higher frame rates.\n\nForza is definitely an AMD-favoring game so it's no surprise to see the RX 6800 XT come top here, but the RTX 4070 still managed to beat the RTX 3080. At 1440p, the RTX 4070 fared better, edging out a bigger lead over the RTX 3080, but still failing to topple the RX 6800 XT. Finally, at 4K, it closed the gap on the RX 6800 XT and again outperformed the RTX 3080, so represents decent value if you plan on gaming at high resolutions in this game.\n\nAt 1080p the RTX 4070 was generally faster than the RX 6800 XT overall with a much higher average frame rate and also bettered the RTX 3080. At 1440p, the RTX 4070 again beat the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT, but the extra performance offered by the pricier RTX 4070 Ti was clear. Stepping up to 4K and the RTX 4070 offered a decent lead over the RTX 3080 and was far faster than the RX 6800 XT - a lead that was enhanced by switching on DLSS where it was again quicker than the 3080, also with DLSS enabled.\n\nThe RTX 4070 and RX 6800 XT traded blows in Far Cry 6 with the AMD card eventually winning overall thanks to a better result at 4K. The RTX 4070 had the measure of the RTX 3080 at 1080p and 1440p but again at 4K it struggled and the RTX 3080 was quicker. With DXR reflections enabled at 4K, the situation improved with the RTX 4070 matching the RX 6800 XT and a with a slightly better result overall than the RTX 3080.\n\nI only had time to test one game with DLSS 3.0 but it's clear that if you're prepared to use it, it can offer huge increases in performance, leapfrogging even the RTX 4090's stock result and essentially doubling its own stock results. However, the RTX 4070 Ti was even faster here.\n\nPerhaps the best result here is power efficiency. With a system power draw of 322W, it was a good 30W lower than the RTX 3070 and over 100W more power frugal than the RTX 4070 Ti with an even bigger gap to the RTX 3080. This means it offers excellent performance per watt and combined with its small size, is a great choice for a small form factor mini-ITX PC.\n\nOverall the RTX 4070 is slightly quicker than the RTX 4070 and often has a decent lead over the AMD RX 6800 XT too. The key benefit, though, is it supremely lower power consumption and low operating temperatures, which will delight those with meagre power supplies or mini-ITX PCs. It looks certain that even smaller models than the Founders Edition card I reviewed here today will be released in future.\n\nThe only thing that can upset sales will be Nvidia lowering the price of the RTX 3080 or indeed AMD with the RX 6800 XT. Assuming we do actually see cards available around the proposed $599 mark, this makes it a better buy than the RTX 3080, although the latter did occasionally offer better performance, usually at higher resolutions.\n\nIt's more expensive than the RTX 3070 was at launch and $600 is still a lot for what is essentially a mid-range graphics card, but with the benefits of DLSS 3.0 and its excellent power efficiency thrown in too, this is undoubtedly the most attractive RTX 40-series card so far, especially to your typical gamer looking to upgrade from RTX 20-series or earlier models or the RTX 3070 and below. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2023/04/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-vs-rtx-3080-and-rx-6800-xt-which-should-you-buy/"

"Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders approves overhaul of state's sentencing laws Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders approved an overhaul of the state\'s sentencing laws Tuesday that will eliminate parole eligibility for certain violent offenses.\n\nThe Republican governor signed into law legislation that will require anyone convicted of any of 18 violent offenses, including capital murder and rape, to serve 100% of their sentences. That section takes effect next year, so it doesn\'t impact people sentenced before 2024.\n\nAnother part of the law that takes effect in 2025 will require offenders convicted of several other offenses to serve at least 85% of their sentences.\n\n""No more letting violent offenders back on the street without serious prison time,"" Sanders said at a bill signing ceremony at State Police headquarters.\n\nARKANSAS GOV. SANDERS SIGNS OFF ON $124M TAX CUT\n\nThe sentencing overhaul comes as parts of Arkansas have seen a spike in crime in the past year. Arkansas\' capital of Little Rock reported a record number of homicides last year.\n\nRepublicans in a number of states have been proposing longer prison sentences after making tough-on-crime promises a cornerstone of last year\'s election. It\'s not yet clear how many of those proposals will pass into law. In Georgia, for example, only a limited number of proposals for longer sentences passed. Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday sent the governor legislation that reduces the use of good behavior incentives to shorten prison stays\n\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signs legislation on April 11, 2023, in Little Rock, Arkansas, that will overhaul the states sentencing laws. The new law will eliminate parole eligibility for certain violent offenses. (AP Photo/Andrew DeMillo)\n\nCritics of the sentencing changes have cast doubt on whether they will reduce crime and said the measure could further crowd a prison system that is already beyond capacity. More than 2,000 state inmates are being held in local jails to ease the crowding. The state\'s prisons are at least 106% above capacity, according to the Department of Corrections.\n\nARKANSAS LEGISLATURE APPROVES $6.2B BUDGET PLAN, SENTENCING OVERHAUL\n\nOpponents also have warned that eliminating or restricting parole eligibility will eliminate an incentive for prisoners.\n\n""I think that\'s going to make prison a more dangerous place,"" Democratic Rep. Andrew Collins, who voted against the measure, said during debate last week.\n\nSanders has called for 3,000 new prison beds to ease overcrowding, and lawmakers have set aside $330 million for that.\n\nThe Corrections Department plans to open 500 beds at prisons around the state within the next month as a temporary measure, Secretary Joe Profiri said.\n\n""I\'m looking at every opportunity that I can provide some level of relief for those particular sheriffs and those county jails"" that are housing state inmates, Profiri told reporters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe new sentencing law also will require other offenders to serve at least 25% or 50% of their sentences. The law doesn\'t spell out how crimes will fall under each of those minimums. Instead, they will be determined by a table set up by the state sentencing commission and approved by the Legislative Council.\n\nThe changes are projected to cost the state more than $163 million over a 10-year period because of the increase in prison population, according to an estimate from the state sentencing commission.\n\nSanders on Tuesday also signed legislation that creates an ""aggravated death by delivery"" charge for someone who delivers fentanyl to another person who dies from taking the drug. If convicted, the person would face between 20 and 60 years or life in prison. https://www.foxnews.com/us/arkansas-gov-sarah-huckabee-sanders-approves-overhaul-states-sentencing-laws"
"You Must See How 'Cyberpunk 2077' Looks Now With Overdrive, Even On A 30 Series On Tuesday, Cyberpunk 2077 cemented its position as the new Crysis, the game now serving as a benchmark for advances in graphics tech that almost no other game is even capable of right now.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 has now launched Overdrive ray tracing, a step up from its previous Psycho setting which allows individual path tracing on light sources, which completely changes the entire visual fidelity of the game into a level we simply have not seen before. And really not seen across most games currently in existence. The tech is so good even Digital Foundry's jaw dropped when testing it.\n\nI was a little bummed when I read that the recommended specs were a 40 series graphics card, with the minimum being a 3090. However, I've gotten Overdrive to work on my 3080, and I've heard some people even having it work decently on their 3070s too.\n\nThe result is…astonishing. There's really nothing else to say. I have never seen the game look anywhere close to this good. I have never seen any game look like this, rather, unless I suppose we're talking about some of the car details in something like Forza or Gran Turismo. But this is an entire open world city, which is an entirely different matter.\n\nThe way I got this to work for me was to turn the Overdrive path tracing option on in the ray tracing settings, and then I used DLAA. No DLSS for me and no DSR. I am far from Mr. Technical when it comes to this sort of thing, so there may be better settings, but this was the best I got things to look for me.\n\nThe bad news is that on my 3080 this…does not really translate into good performance. It mostly just looks pretty. The path tracing only goes to 1080p and 30 fps on a 3090, so on my PC yeah, I'm hitting sub 30 frames under this system. Again, maybe there's a way past this, and even if not, it's worth checking out just for the visuals alone.\n\nOnce I had this on, I spent about an hour just wandering around the city taking screenshots of areas I'd previously visited a million times before. I'd say that things looked better at night with the wet streets and all the reflections, but during the day is when you could see more of the complex, geometric shadows that are possible with this new path tracing system.\n\nI've uploaded some of my favorite Overdrive path tracing screenshots from Cyberpunk 2077 below. I would love to see some of yours as you try this out and explore.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

"First Time Conducting Annual Company Reviews? How To Introduce Employees To The Process Annual reviews are an important tool for assessing employee performance, setting goals and providing feedback. However, if your company has never conducted annual reviews before, it can be challenging to know where to start.\n\nIntroducing a new process can be difficult, especially if your employees are not used to it. To help, a panel of Forbes Human Resources Council members provides some tips for first-timers on how to introduce annual reviews to employees. From setting clear objectives to asking the team for feedback, these strategies can help you successfully implement this important process.\n\nIt will be essential to treat this like the change initiative it is and manage it accordingly. Explore how you will create the conditions where such a dramatic change can take hold, thrive and ultimately add the intended value. More than simply changing what you do, explore how you will design the work environment to support and sustain the change with an eye on what new behaviors must occur. - Will Gaines, Super Store Industries\n\nIf you\'re new to annual reviews, there is no need to start them. It\'s an outdated process rife with recency bias and, quite frankly, doesn\'t change or inspire performance. There are better ways to truly enable--not manage--performance, such as: providing visibility to top company goals, encouraging ongoing conversations and check-ins and making feedback and recognition tools easily accessible. - Jamie Aitken, Betterworks\n\nHere are three steps that must be followed to have a successful annual review process. First, develop a process that aligns with company values and strategy. This will help to anchor and receive acceptance faster in this process. Then, deploy and communicate a schedule that includes setting goals, checking progress and measuring results. Finally, align results on performance metrics that will result in a salary increase. - Angeles Escalante, Caterpillar\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. Do I qualify?\n\nPerformance management requires ongoing, continuous and immediate feedback. Introducing methods to capture these conversations can help alleviate the pressure of a one-time sprint for both managers and employees alike. Bringing everyone on board is essential for the success of any initiative. Share how and why these conversations year-round provide the foundation for growth and development for all. - Maria Miletic\n\nEmployees shouldn\'t feel that they\'re only being evaluated on last year\'s work, but also on this year\'s work. Providing feedback on employees\' performance over the past year only tells them what they should have done differently regarding last year\'s goals. Managers should also focus on goals for the upcoming year, and how employees can apply their feedback to improve future performance. - John Feldmann, Insperity\n\nThe first step before introducing annual reviews to the workforce is to make sure you have a competitive compensation program. Once the payment plan is in place, build a performance management system that connects to the compensation program. Make sure that your system rewards employees for their results and then you will achieve pay for performance. - David Weaver, Compensation and HR Group\n\nFirst, be grateful you aren\'t burdened by antiquated processes. Performance management has evolved a lot over the past 10 years! The biggest tip is to break the process up into regular ""check-in"" conversations throughout the year, capped by a final ""review"" conversation that includes a rating. Also, keep it forward-looking--think ""getting better"" rather than ""rehashing issues."" - Rick Rittmaster, CorTalent\n\nAlthough annual reviews offer employees the chance to get actionable feedback about their year-long performance, employers must not leave feedback on these reviews. Implementing continuous feedback throughout the year ensures there are no surprises in an annual review and allows managers and employees to focus more on the future, paving a path to career advancement and development. - Tanya Jansen, beqom\n\nCommunicate the purpose, payoff and process early and often. While there\'s great benefit in conducting annual reviews, the communication plan and accountability measures must be clear from the beginning and reiterated throughout the process. Annual reviews are not the time for surprises, but rather a summary of the previous year along with outlined goals and resources for the coming year. - Domonique Revere, Adjaye Associates\n\nBe clear about ""the why"" in every communication. Communicate how the organization, and each individual, benefit from participating in the process. From there, train managers and all staff on how to embody the feedback habits that will hold up the annual review process on a daily basis, and always come back to the intention in ""the why."" - Bethany Kurbis, Integrative Coaching LLC\n\nBe sure to include feedback forums and a debrief element at the conclusion of your performance cycle. What did leaders like or not like about the process? What did employees find valuable? Incorporate this feedback to continuously improve your performance management motion and ensure it remains relevant to the organization\'s needs. - Megan Barbier, Jumio\n\nI recommend implementing regular coaching conversations first. These are meant to coach others to succeed and focus forward on goals and projects. These types of meetings, which could be monthly or quarterly, make it easy to course correct quickly rather than having to ""annually review"" performance after a year has passed. We should always be future-focused and not look back at performance. - Christina Hobbs, Force Scaling\n\nFocus groups, virtual or live, can go a long way to presenting buy-in to the process. The many backgrounds and employee experience your employees have had will help you understand what is possible, what works and what doesn\'t. Employees will want to have a say in the performance process, and this is a great way to build trust, two-way communication and a process that will be adopted. - Cat Colella-Graham\n\nIntroducing and managing performance in the workplace demands a delicate balance between organizational objectives, individual goals and the manager\'s experience in conducting effective performance evaluations. Create a template that is both inventive and compliant, taking into account the industry\'s requirements without unnecessary bureaucracy. - Nara Ringrose, Aquila Nuclear Engineering\n\nExtensive reviews, complex rating systems and unrealistic goal setting are the makers of a disastrous performance review process. Start the process as early in the year as possible, so employees are well aware of what they\'ll be evaluated on. This will eliminate confusion during the actual reviews and greater chance for the achievement of desired goals. - Nakisha Griffin, Neustar Security Services https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2023/04/12/first-time-conducting-annual-company-reviews-how-to-introduce-employees-to-the-process/"
"Kazm Integrates Unlock Protocol to Enable Fully Managed On-Chain Memberships for Web3 Academy The integration enables responsive tokenized memberships for Web3 Academy subscribers\n\nNEW YORK, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Web3 Academy launches on-chain memberships with Kazm\'s integration of Unlock Protocol. The integration uses NFTs as the digital infrastructure needed to manage tiered membership requirements for the Web3 Academy education platform, unlocking an entirely new way for membership data to go on-chain. When someone purchases a membership to Web3 Academy, Kazm manages the technical backend for these memberships and Unlock Protocol serves as the bridge connecting recurring membership data and users.\n\n""CRM software and memberships are the perfect use cases for NFTs as the digital infrastructure they are meant to be,"" said Julien Genestoux, Founder and CEO of Unlock Protocol. ""The combination of Kazm and Unlock creates an entirely new way to turn subscriptions into memberships by linking credentials with verifiable, on-chain data.""\n\n""Unlock is serving as the technical connector piece between the membership NFTs we issue to our users and the backend membership requirements managed by Kazm. It\'s an exciting glimpse into the future of how on-chain data can power experiences and automate verification practices that, traditionally, have required custom software solutions or human inputs,"" said Kyle Reidhead, CEO at Web3 Academy. ""This is what the future looks like.""\n\n""The combination of Unlock Protocol and Kazm\'s member management will make it easy to deliver web3-enabled experiences to existing audiences,"" said Ben Turtel, CEO at Kazm. ""For Web3 Academy, this allows them to continue to manage subscriptions through web2 tooling like Substack and Stripe, while on-chain memberships are automatically kept in sync. This allows creators, communities, and brands to leverage the power of web3 without selling NFTs or migrating member touch points -- clearing the way for the next billion users to experience web3.""\n\nThe experience works like this -- someone looking to learn about web3 signs up for a Web3 Academy subscription on Substack. Kazm forms are used to verify the user\'s subscription status and tier, issue an Unlock membership NFT, and keep the NFT\'s expiration date in sync with any changes in subscription status over time. Web3 Academy can use no-code rules in Kazm to gamify these memberships, incentivizing users to upgrade to higher subscription tiers, reward engagement across platforms, or deepen their learning journey. For example, as users complete courses, they earn certificates of completion, also powered by Unlock. Unlock Protocol issues the NFTs, Web3 Academy offers the courses, and Kazm manages gamified rewards, tiered memberships, and community data via their community management platform.\n\nUnlock is building the web\'s new business model by enabling new ways for creators to monetize their content through a decentralized, access control system. Unlock\'s solution is an open source, Ethereum-based protocol that streamlines membership benefits for online communities by giving creators control over subscriptions and access to their content, without any middlemen. The Unlock Protocol can be applied to publishing (paywalls), newsletters, software licenses or even the physical world, such as with transportation systems. The web revolutionized all of these areas - Unlock will make them economically viable.\n\nAbout Kazm Kazm is building the future of memberships & data-driven communities. Kazm unifies member data across touchpoints and helps communities recognize, engage, and reward activity everywhere with the power of web3.\n\nWeb3 Academy is building your one trusted source of information in web3 to keep you from getting caught in the hype cycle so you can capitalize on the opportunity of the next big phase of the internet.\n\nBy providing a range of services, like newsletter, podcast and courses, Web3 Academy carves a path for DOers to confidently build and invest in web3.\n\nPress Contact Mike West [email protected] (415) 689-8574\n\nSOURCE Unlock Protocol https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kazm-integrates-unlock-protocol-to-enable-fully-managed-on-chain-memberships-for-web3-academy-301795216.html"

"Biden Administration Electric Car Directive Increases Pressure On US Airports Hand of man inserting a power cord into an electric car for charging ecofriendly vehicle on green ... [ ] landscape\n\nNumerous reports indicate that the United States Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) is preparing to issue new federal emissions standards for light-duty vehicles that would force the number of electric vehicles sold to increase dramatically.\n\nThe new proposed rules, if approved, are reported to require that by 2032, just nine years from now, between 64% and 67% of all new-car sales will be electric vehicles. During 2022, only about 6% of the new car sales in the United States were electric.\n\nShould the EPA issue such a directive, it will put enormous pressure on the country's electricity grids. Already, the grids are stretched thin, and in a number of locations are incapable of allowing new connections without capital improvements.\n\nSince 1970, America's electric grids have suffered increased major outages.\n\nThe biggest single cause is winter snowstorms, with summer storms coming in second. Just two years ago, almost the entire electric grid in Texas, known as ERCOT, failed, causing at least 4.5 million homes to lose power.\n\nSince 12 power grids were completed in the continental United States in the 1950's, there are serious concerns that we have not modernized our infrastructure to keep them reliable in the current environment, and the grids will not be capable of accommodating the increased reliance on electrical power as we attempt to combat climate change.\n\nIn the United States, the power grid generally refers to one overall power grid consisting of two major and three minor grids. It contains nearly 160,000 miles of lines operated by some 500 companies.\n\nPower is produced in over 7,300 power plants and connects 145 million customers.\n\nOf that electric power, just 20% currently comes from renewable sources. According to the United States Energy Information Agency, the largest sources of American electricity are natural gas (38%) and coal (23%). As of 2020, wind was the largest source of renewable power (8.4%) with hydroelectric (7.3%) coming in second. Solar only produced 2.3% of all electricity generated.\n\nTherein of course provides the dilemma. If we seek to dramatically increase the amount of electricity used in the United States, to run a rapidly expanding number of new electric vehicles, we will need to generate much more of that power (to say nothing of storing and transmitting it) to meet our expanding needs. To generate more electricity we will need to either ramp up our generation from current sources, which are overwhelmingly fossil fuels and nuclear (about 20%), or else try within one decade to totally shift our production and grid to favor renewable source, which of course must be stored once generated and transmitted to where the power needs to go. The challenges are enormous.\n\nAt the same time as we face that, there are calls for all major transportation systems to switch to renewable energy. Thus, airports around the country are under pressure to move quickly from powering their operations by fossil fuels to powering their operations from renewable sources.\n\nEven should this be scientifically possible and feasible, of course, airports and other large commercial facilities face the prospect of spending billions of dollars to shift their operations to run on renewable electricity, only to find out that there will not be enough energy available to power their operations.\n\nFor the Biden Administration, the key question will be whether to try to force this change at all levels of society at once, or try to do it in stages. Intellectually, it makes more sense to do this in a step-by-step process, but the intensity of the climate change movement, and the need to make up for lost time, may make this politically impossible. Having spent much of the last twenty years warning that the world faces impending disaster from climate change, it will be difficult for any Democratic Administration to do anything but seek a radical immediate transition. It remains to be seen how large power users, like airports, will accommodate these contradictory demands, and even if it can be done. https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2023/04/12/biden-administration-electric-car-directive-increases-pressure-on-us-airports/"

"Clarence Thomas And The Troubling Problem Of Greed In Washington Stubby Kaye, of the Broadway musical Li\'l Abner, eats huge portions of food.\n\nFinding greed in Washington, D.C. is about as predictable as finding flowers blooming in the springtime, and this spring is no exception with the recent news that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted lavish trips from a billionaire conservative donor named Harlan Crow. While these vacations and rides on luxury yachts and private jets may not have violated ethics rules at the time they occurred, they certainly have an unsavory appearance, particularly given the enormous influence the Supreme Court wields and the need for it to be free from any hint of corruption or illicit activity.\n\nUnfortunately, the debate about Justice Thomas is already dividing along the usual partisan lines, with left-wing outlets such as ProPublica taking fire at the conservative justice and right-wing outlets such as the Wall Street Journal opinion page defending him. The Washingtonian has even drawn attention to Crow\'s collection of Adolf Hitler paintings and other Nazi memorabilia, seeking to draw a connection between the Republican benefactor and a dangerous, eugenics-centered ideology.\n\nSadly, Justice Thomas\'s missteps are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the issue of greed in our nation\'s capital. As author Peter Schweizer argued in his book Throw Them All Out, politicians on both sides of the political spectrum have engaged in insider trading for years, using their privileged access to information and power to make personal profits and to steer government contracts and subsidies to their closest friends, families and donors.\n\nThese dynamics help explain why U.S. senators cling to their jobs, often until they are on the very brink of death. Too many close acquaintances and family members profit from their power, making it difficult for them to let go. Schweizer\'s book is a damning indictment of the political class and the extent to which greed has infiltrated Congress and the White House. It\'s a bipartisan issue: neither Republicans nor Democrats are immune to the problem.\n\nA Quartz study analyzing data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics found that the median net worth of members of Congress was $1.1 million in 2015, more than 12 times the net worth of the median American household. Additionally, a study by the organization Public Citizen found that 50% of former House members and 60% of former senators had become registered lobbyists in 2012. Another analysis found the average salary increase for such lawmakers-turned-lobbyists is 1,452%.\n\nWhile the word ""greed"" is often thrown around in political discussions, there is considerable confusion about what exactly constitutes greed and who is to blame for it. Politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders blame corporate greed for inflation, when the more likely culprit is loose monetary policy and their own reckless spending.\n\nThis confusion has led many on Twitter to jokingly refer to the imaginary link between greed and inflation as ""greedflation."" But while the politicians tend to get the details wrong about what form greed takes, they are right that greed is one of the most serious and rampant problems in Washington.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been accused of abusing his position on the Supreme Court ... [ ] by accepting lavish vacations from a billionaire donor. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images)\n\nIt\'s not surprising that so many people feel disillusioned with the political process and distrustful of politicians. When they see Clarence Thomas accepting extravagant gifts from a billionaire, it\'s easy to conclude that the system is rigged against them. But there is hope. The fact that these issues are being exposed is a positive sign. Even if Clarence Thomas didn\'t violate the law, he will likely exercise more restraint in the future, given all the negative press coverage.\n\nUltimately, however, the problem of greed in Washington is a complex one that has deep causes. It\'s not just politicians who are to blame. Our culture elevates celebrity, wealth and prestige above more humane values and pursuits. That says as much about ""us"" as it does about the ""them"" in Washington, D.C.\n\nA cultural shift may be what is needed to elevate integrity and public service over personal gain. The recent news about Clarence Thomas serves to highlight the issue, but it won\'t be enough to change our culture. Our reactionary partisan impulses aren\'t helping matters either. As it turns out, the problem of greedflation--or rising rates of greed over time--may be more real than we think. If we genuinely want to root out corruption, however, the best place to start may not be to ""throw them all out"" but rather to look in the mirror first. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesbroughel/2023/04/12/clarence-thomas-and-the-troubling-problem-of-greed-in-washington/"

That was up slightly from February\'s 5.5 percent increase, and the first acceleration since September.\n\nThe fresh inflation data come at a challenging economic moment for the Federal Reserve, the government\'s main inflation fighter. The central bank has been trying to wrestle price increases back under control for slightly more than a year, raising interest rates to nearly 5 percent from near zero as recently as March 2022.\n\nOfficials are now assessing how their policy changes are working -- and trying to gauge how much more they need to do to ensure that price increases come fully under control. Inflation has been moderating after peaking at about 9 percent last summer, but the process has been gradual. It remains a long way back to the 2 percent inflation that was normal before the onset of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n""Inflation was never expected to decelerate in a straight line,"" Tiffany Wilding, an economist at Pimco, wrote in a note previewing the release.\n\nUncertainty over how quickly and completely price increases will cool is being compounded by recent developments. A series of high-profile bank blowups last month could slow the economy, but it is unclear by how much. Some Fed officials are urging caution in light of the turmoil, even as others warn that the central bank should keep its foot on the economic brake and remain focused on its fight against rising prices.\n\nFed officials target 2 percent inflation, which they define using a different index: the Personal Consumption Expenditures measure, which uses some data from the consumer price measure but is calculated differently and released a few weeks later. That measure has also been sharply elevated.\n\nFed officials are closely watching services inflation -- and particularly services beyond housing -- for a sense of whether price increases are poised to fade. Wednesday\'s report showed that price increases for used vehicles dropped on a monthly basis, while those for new vehicles and hotel rooms sped up.\n\nA measure of services inflation stripping out energy, calculated by Bloomberg, cooled slightly. https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/04/12/business/cpi-inflation-fed"

"What's Balenciaga To Do About The Harry Potter Meme? Any luxury brand\'s intellectual property becomes a bit like a generic Lego piece, able to be placed ... [ ] wherever anyone wants in the digital world,"" said Milton Pedraza, The Luxury Institute.\n\nIn a 55-second video, YouTuber demonflyingfox reimagined the Harry Potter cast of characters as Balenciaga models, poking fun at the self-important imagery and styling of the brand. The video was released about a month ago and has garnered over 6 million views.\n\nThe closing line captures the tongue-in-cheek essence of the meme, ""There is no good and evil. There is only Balenciaga and those too weak to seek it. Balenciaga.""\n\nThe original video\'s popularity has spawned a host of other popular films interpreted through the Balenciaga lens, including Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Breaking Bad.\n\nFellow Forbes.com contributor Dani Di Placido explained the meme phenomenon: ""Generative AI is often used to blend clashing aesthetics together, to create the kind of images that burn in your brain, and subsequently go viral.""\n\nBalenciaga seems ripe for the clash, having been caught up in a cultural firestorm of its own making around imagery considered over-sexualizing children in an ad campaign late year.\n\nBut appropriating the aesthetics and styling of a luxury brand to make a joke of it, even a mockery of it, seems something no luxury brand would take lying down.\n\nYet, Kering-owned Balenciaga isn\'t any ordinary luxury brand. Under the creative leadership of Demna and guided by its CEO Cédric Charbit, Balenciaga has positioned the luxury brand as more than a creator of exquisitely styled and crafted fashion but as a cultural construct and touch point.\n\n""Balenciaga spearheaded an ongoing process of transformation: from the original couturier\'s approach, centered on fabric selection, shapes, silhouettes, tailoring, etc., into being \'culture-centered,\'"" shared Alessandro Balossini Volpe, professor of business management and strategy at Istituto Marangoni and ISTUD.\n\n""High fashion has always been a cultural expression, but today, the cultural concept is designed first, and clothes are one of the many ways this culture is expressed. No wonder that Balenciaga can resonate so easily with contemporary expressions of pop culture.""\n\nIronically, Balenciaga has taken a meme approach to designing fashion. Its re-imagined Ikea tote bag for $2,000  is perhaps the best example, which Ikea took on the chin and made a joke of it. ""Get the original for just $0.90,"" it\'s ad stated.\n\nBut now the shoe is on the other foot, and Balenciaga is the subject of the joke.\n\nMilton Pedraza, CEO of The Luxury Institute weighed in:\n\n""I am not an attorney, but I believe that unless it gave legal consent, this is a violation of Balenciaga\'s intellectual property rights, and it may have grounds for legal action.\n\n""Otherwise, any luxury brand\'s intellectual property becomes a bit like a generic Lego piece, able to be placed wherever anyone wants in the digital world. That\'s not ok. It can redefine and damage your brand equity.""\n\nOf note: a company spokesperson confirmed the company was not involved with the creation of the meme but did not provide further comment. And @demonflyingfox Twitter profile states it is not affiliated with Balenciaga.\n\nLuxury brands are fiercely protective of their intellectual property and brand image. In 2011 Christian Louboutin sued Yves Saint Laurent for appropriating its signature red soles on a pair of shoes. A lengthy legal battle ensued with Louboutin eventually granted trademark protection over red soled shoes.\n\nGucci, Kering-owned sister brand of Balenciaga, sued Forever 21 for using their trademarked blue-red-blue and green-red-green stripes on its clothing and accessories, with the suit settled before trial in 2018.\n\nAnd Balenciaga was on the receiving end of a trademark infringement suit brought by Car-Freshener Corporation for appropriating its protected tree-shaped air freshener tag in a keychain. That suit was settled in mediation.\n\nThe dangers are many with letting people run off with a brand\'s carefully-crafted cues and clues. The brand loses control of its image and risks diluting its desirability, and it confuses people about which messages come directly and authentically from the brand and which from the fans.\n\n""Isn\'t there are risk of being perceived as not being truly excellent in what should be its core area of competence, i.e., high fashion itself?"" Volpe asked.\n\nUnder Demna, Balenciaga has fearlessly walked on the cultural edge, and perhaps the brand will see the upside to having so many people introduced to the brand through characters they\'ve come to love in film.\n\n""This might be a good thing. It clearly shows that the brand is not dead, even after its recent horrific cultural misstep. Humor generated spontaneously by the audience is the highest form of cultural relevance a brand can get,"" said Dr. Martin Olbert, The Meaning Expert and founder of the consultancy Meaning.Global.\n\n""It shows a spontaneous brand rebirth done by people. It says Balenciaga is still current and people care about it,"" she added.\n\nProfessor Volpe saw the positive upside too. ""Brand awareness can spread at the speed of light, particularly among the volatile, scarcely loyal younger generation. The potential impact on brand image can be very strong, as brands are instantly perceived as the most advanced, forward-thinking expressions of contemporary culture.""\n\nAt the same time, if Balenciaga doesn\'t do something, anything, it is dangerously close to being a here-today, gone-tomorrow fad or worse, being written off as a joke.\n\nThe dictionary definitions of the word mockery are anything but nice: ""Insulting or contemptuous action or speech; subject of laughter, derision or sport; a counterfeit appearance; an insincere, contemptible or impertinent imitation; something ridiculously or imprudently unsuitable.""\n\nLuxury brands, at their core, have to be aspirational, so Dr. Olbert calls on Balenciaga to use the Harry Potter meme as inspiration for its own campaign to celebrate, rather than denigrate the brand.\n\n""Use the gist of this meme and create your own videos on various subjects that reinforce values of the Balenciaga brand and build on the momentum. It can serve as a great vehicle for Balenciaga to get back into the limelight after a dark stint that harmed its image and reputation. Use it to your advantage and create your own campaign,"" she advised.\n\nAnd she warned that with the rapid adoption of AI and user-generated-content through social media, more brands are going to face this dilemma. Instilling more meaning into the brand is the solution.\n\n""That\'s why creating strong brand meaning that can act as an authentic signature is the greatest insurance that a brand can get. If you can\'t create this authentic meaning, you will be easily copied by others,"" she said.\n\n""The proliferation of AI poses an amazing opportunity to luxury brands to switch focus and develop their own proprietary meaning now to protect themselves in the future. Meaning will be the most important brand asset,"" she concluded. https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2023/04/12/whats-balenciaga-to-do-about-the-harry-potter-meme/"

"The Malaysian Luxury Rain Forest Retreat That Guests Return To Again And Again: The Datai In Langkawi The main pool at the Datai\n\nThirty years ago, when Asian super-luxury resorts were first being developed, it was all about the beach. The unspoken rule was to maximize the waterfront, knock down some trees, give everyone a water-sparkly view.\n\nThe developers and the designers of the Datai thought beyond that. The luxury resort in Langkawi, Malaysia, has a perfectly lovely little beach along Datai Bay, but that\'s almost beside the point (even though National Geographic called it one of the best in the world). The 121-room hotel is integrated thoroughly into one of the world\'s oldest rain forests, with its freestanding villas surrounded by towering trees. In some cases, floor plans were changed to ensure that no trees would be cut down.\n\n(To be honest, the constant squeal of crickets could be a bit much for a former rock \'n\' roll journalist who suffers from tinnitus. Sometimes the quiet of my rain forest villa came as a welcome relief.)\n\nA bedroom at the Datai\n\nSensitive ears aside, that intimate connection with nature is what drives the Datai. Thirty years after Kerry Hill created the original biophilic architecture--way before anyone used the word biophilic--in collaboration with Didier Lefort, the hotel has gone on to become one of the most awarded in Southeast Asia. And now, thanks to a recent renovation by M. Lefort, it\'s better than ever.\n\nThe Datai wears its age well. In some ways, it\'s an old-school resort, with a weekly printed newsletter, activities calendar, and musings ""signed"" by longtime, charismatic general manager Arnaud Girodon. The staff--many of whom have been there 20 years or more, and all 500 of whom were retained during the closures of 2020 and 2021--is beyond attentive and detail-attuned: After I drank all the small refillable glass bottles of water in my villa, they were replaced with larger ones. A colleague mentioned that she liked roti, and it magically appeared for her at breakfast.\n\nAbout those refillable bottles: Sustainability is one of those terms that have become as keywordy as experiential and authentic were a decade ago. And too many hotels brag about their LED blurbs or reduced housekeeping (both of which save them money) in hopes of getting some green credibility.\n\nThe Datai is the real deal. Nothing leaves the resort bound for a landfill. Meticulous sorting programs assure that anything that can possibly be donated, recycled or upcycled is, and whatever is left is incinerated in a state-of-the-art machine called the asher, which produces only steam and neutral ashes, which can be left on the forest floor or mixed with concrete for the inevitable repairs that island resorts require. The person who showed it to me thought that Singapore\'s Changi airport possibly has one; otherwise it\'s unique in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe engineering nerd in me was delighted by all of this, and the staff is only too happy to show it off to guests, along with the permaculture kitchen garden and the upcycling lab, where people can make craft projects using leftover coffee grounds, candle stubs and other waste. In fact, all of the sustainability-related activities, for children and adults, are offered for free or at cost.\n\nThese include things like forest bathing with a meditation teacher and sustainability adviser Irshad Mobarak (""the David Attenborough of Malaysia,"" who has been featured on the BBC), bird-watching with an ornithologist and traipsing through the rain forests to watch monkeys with another naturalist, Chin Wen. She\'s a graduate of Jane Goodall\'s international Roots & Shoots program, one of the many organizations that the Datai supports with its Datai Pledge. The details are a little wonky, but the frequent 100-page impact reports prove that the commitment is real.\n\nForest bathing near the Datai\n\nYet for all its sustainability bona fides, the Datai doesn\'t compromise on luxury. (And we should all know by now that the two have never been incompatible, provided some smart decisions are made.) Tea is served pewter from Royal Selgangor, the company that supplies royal families around the world. The house Champagne is from Michel Roux. (Girodon has some connections.) The boutique features all the best brands in Malaysia, and there\'s an ""atelier"" of artisans in residence, producing contemporary renditions of traditional crafts.\n\nThere are five restaurants, from a Michelin-adjacent fine dining room that serves a ten-course tasting menu to a Thai restaurant perched on stilts in the treetops, some 100 feet above the ground.\n\nOne evening, while I was enjoying a Malaysian curry at another restaurant, the Gulai House, an enthusiastic couple approached me. No one from the resort put them up from this, they assured me. But they had heard that a journalist was on the premises and wanted to make sure I knew how much they love the place. This was their 20th visit or so, and sometimes they thought about trying other resorts, but in the end, it was the forest villas of the Datai that kept calling them back. https://www.forbes.com/sites/annabel/2023/04/12/the-malaysian-luxury-rain-forest-retreat-that-guests-return-to-again-and-again-the-datai-in-langkawi/"
"Nobody Wants To Write An Obituary. Some things in life are harder than others. The Stoics believed that recognizing the inevitability of death every day would give impetus to living life to the fullest. Writing obituaries for loved ones is a distasteful but necessary task.

"Power Move: Albert Pujols' Golf Game Takes Center Stage On The Celebrity Circuit SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA - FEBRUARY 08: Former MLB player Albert Pujols looduring the 2023 Annexus Pro-Am ... [ ] prior to the WM Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale on February 08, 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\nAlbert Pujols is a member of several of baseball\'s most exclusive clubs, including the 3,000 hit club, 2,000 RBI club, and the three-time MVP club. Last Fall he became only the fourth player to join the 700 home runs club. Since retiring, the slugger is still mashing balls deep into the horizon, only now his towering shots are finding fairways instead of the other side of fences.\n\nThe freshly retired Cardinals legend no longer has to squeeze in golf outings around a marathon 162 game MLB schedule in his new role as a special assistant to the Angels under a 10-year personal services contract valued at $1 million a year. The 11-time all-star will be in the field next week at the Invited Celebrity Classic, a PGA Tour Champions event quickly ascending the celebrity golf tournament leaderboard.\n\nWhen golf fans think of the top of the lineup of celebrity golf tournaments, the American Century Championship in Tahoe, the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions in Lake Nona and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am (the grand dame) immediately come to mind.\n\nA newbie on the scene, the private golf and country club owner and operator\'s event presented by Choctaw Casinos & Resorts features a $2 million purse for the pros with $500,000 on the line for the celebs. In its debut season both tiers of the competition were settled in sudden death playoffs. Davis Cup Captain Mardy Fish took down Cowboys QB Tony Romo while Scott Parel survived a three-way contest to secure his fourth senior tour victory. They will all be back in the mix next week at Las Colinas Country Club in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nProceeds from the Invited Celebrity Classic benefit the Momentous Institute along with First Tee chapters in Greater Dallas and Fort Worth. Last year the tournament raised over $200,000 to support its non-profit partners with organizers intent on doubling up that tally this year.\n\nThe celebrity field is loaded with sports hall of famers with Ivan Rodriguez, Greg Maddux, Emmitt Smith and Brian Urlacher among the notables competing along with a surefire future first ballot pick in Albert Pujols.\n\n""We all sooner or later may hang up our jersey but it\'s what you do after. Just using those opportunities now to travel, to spend time with the family and do the things I wasn\'t able to do because of the schedule. Now I have my own schedule and can do my own thing,"" Pujols said.\n\nWhile the event only debuted last year, it has become a fast favorite among touring pros like Billy Andrade who had a blast playing with John Smoltz and Annika Sorenstam in the first round last year.\n\n""It\'s at the top of my list. It\'s so much fun for the Champions Tour players to intermingle with the stars that we grew up watching. Last year\'s vibe was fantastic and I know it\'s just going to get better and better,"" Andrade said, adding that he\'s happy to see Albert Pujols join the field. The two played a round together at Michael Jordan\'s The Grove XXIII golf club and he was impressed by the 11-time All-Star\'s swing.\n\nBaseball, a game Pujols first picked up when he was 5-years-old will always be his first-love but the slugger has fallen hard for golf, a passion he cultivated during his playing years.\n\n""I love the game of golf and try to play as much as I can. My son AJ who graduates next month, he loves the game and wants to go pro and still has a long way to go. To be able to pick up the clubs and hang out with my boy and my kiddos and have fun hitting balls around is just great,"" Pujols said.\n\nWhen he needed to clear his mind, he often found himself hitting the driving range and even fitting in the occasional emergency nine before he had to head to the stadium for batting practice.\n\n""I\'d go play nine holes before a game and then go to the game and I\'d get two or three hits and then think \'I need to do this more often,\'"" Pujols said.\n\nHis first ever Pro-Am was years back at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera where he played with Keegan Bradley. Once he got over the first tee jitters, he settled down and really enjoyed the experience and talking golf and baseball with the PGA Championship winner.\n\nWhile one may be forgiven for guessing that striping the ball with his driver may be the strongest part of the game of a golfer who knocked 703 home runs out of the park in the big leagues, putting is actually his greatest strength.\n\n""It\'s something I work a lot at and I enjoy. I can read putts really, really well,"" Pujols said, adding that his golf swing almost mirrors his baseball swing.\n\n""I just put the ball on the tee and swing it. I don\'t take that much time because I believe the more time I think while over the ball, the more stuff goes through my head. I just address the ball and then swing, try to have a game plan and go with it. It\'s not like baseball where I had to write things down about the pitcher, the guy I was facing and watch video,"" Pujols said.\n\nExpect to see Pujols pop up in the field on a much more regular basis going forward, he\'s going to try to make as many events as he can. https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikedojc/2023/04/12/power-move-albert-pujols-golf-game-takes-center-stage-on-the-celebrity-circuit/"

"WWE Reportedly Considering Big Brock Lesnar Dream Match Brock Lesnar recently turned heel and is now feuding with Cody Rhodes on WWE Raw. (Credit: Alex ... [ ] Bierens de Haan/Getty Images)\n\nWWE may be one step closer to a massive dream match for Brock Lesnar--and it\'s not against Cody Rhodes.\n\nFresh off a shocking heel turn and now in the early stages of a feud with Rhodes, Lesnar could be slated for a blockbuster feud with the dominant Intercontinental Champion Gunther, according to WRKD Wrestling:\n\nIn late 2022, Lesnar vs. Gunther was actually slated for WrestleMania 39, but those plans changed. Lesnar himself even revealed during an interview with ESPN\'s Daniel Cormier (h/t The Sportster) that the match was under consideration: ""It was just proposed, and I don\'t know if I don\'t make the calls around here. It\'s just one of those things. When this was proposed to me, I liked it because I like the challenge, and I like the matchup.""\n\nOf course, that dream match didn\'t happen at WrestleMania 39, with WWE opting instead to do the ever-so-puzzling Omos vs. Lesnar match while Gunther tore the house down in an instant classic triple threat match with Drew McIntyre and Sheamus. Gunther remains the Intercontinental Champion while Lesnar and Gunther are now both heels, seemingly making a match between the two unlikely.\n\nBut especially when it comes to a star the caliber of Lesnar, heel-face alignment hardly matters, and given the overwhelmingly positive reaction to teases of a potential Gunther vs. Lesnar feud, this is a true dream match that must happen before it\'s too late.\n\nAt Elimination Chamber, Lesnar suggested that he was nearing retirement, three years after he nearly called it quits in 2020. But every time it feels like Lesnar is about to leave WWE for good, he either sticks around or shows up again sooner than expected.\n\nLesnar\'s recent WWE deal was set to expire around WrestleMania 39, but he\'s obviously agreed to some sort of new deal or extension--as evidenced by the fact that he\'s now feuding with WWE\'s top singles babyface in Rhodes. Lesnar now fits in as an obstacle that Rhodes must overcome, presumably at Backlash, so that Rhodes can once again challenge Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship.\n\nThe ideal role for Lesnar would be for him to put over Rhodes clean at Backlash, but Lesnar is almost always protected by WWE\'s booking. See: His disqualification loss against Bobby Lashley at Elimination Chamber or his dominant win over Omos at WrestleMania. Especially if WWE intends on doing Gunther vs. Lesnar anytime soon, Lesnar could--and should--be kept looking strong as much as possible.\n\nWWE, after all, has typically made a significant financial investment in Lesnar, paying him as if he\'s a star in a category of his own. Based on recent crowd reactions, Lesnar is, along with Reigns, the biggest and most polarizing star WWE has, and he\'s the perfect opponent for someone like Gunther.\n\nOver much of the past year, Gunther and his Imperium stable have done a tremendous job of elevating the once forgotten Intercontinental title, which is now a prize worth fighting for after years of the title being overlooked. Gunther is fresh off a red hot feud with McIntyre and Sheamus, and the three stars delivered arguably the best match of WrestleMania 39.\n\nAside from Reigns, there isn\'t a heel who\'s been booked better than Gunther over the past couple of years, and Gunther reportedly has a big supporter in Triple H, who could elevate him to world title contention in the near future. With Reigns continuing to dominate the world championship scene, however, arguably the next step for Gunther is a match with Lesnar, who remains a top star even when not challening for a title.\n\nWith Gunther and Lesnar potentially set to end up on the same brand in the upcoming 2023 draft, the stars are aligning for these two behemoths to clash in what would be one of the most anticipated big man matches in recent WWE history on a big stage like SummerSlam.\n\nAnd that\'s something for WWE fans to be excited about. https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2023/04/12/wwe-reportedly-considering-big-brock-lesnar-dream-match/"
"DeSantis to appear at Iowa fundraiser hosted by House Republican amid 2024 speculation Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds considers banning social media accounts for kids under the age of 18 without parental consent to combat its negative impact on mental health and its threat to national security on \'The Story of Martha MacCallum.\'\n\nFIRST ON FOX: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is returning to Iowa for a fundraiser next month, Fox News Digital has learned, as the Republican 2024 primary race continues to heat up.\n\nHe and his wife Casey DeSantis will be special guests at the ""Feenstra Family Picnic"" held by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, in Sioux Center. It\'s the third such fundraiser for the Ways & Means Committee Republican.\n\n""In Iowa, like Florida, freedom is valued, parents\' rights are protected, and faith comes first,"" DeSantis told Fox News Digital. ""Congressman Feenstra is a strong conservative with a record of delivering results, and I\'m happy to support him.""\n\nThe GOP governor has been talked about as a potentially dominant 2024 contender for much of this year – though he has yet to declare his candidacy – particularly after a commanding double-digit re-election victory in 2022. But some recent reports have surfaced that his momentum has been stymied by concerns over his ability to connect with voters outside of Florida and the resurgence of former President Donald Trump.\n\n2024 FRICTION: FORMER TRUMP OFFICIALS JOIN PRO-DESANTIS GROUP\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis is widely expected to announce a 2024 presidential bid (Octavio Jones/Getty Images)\n\nThe governor will have the opportunity to assert his popularity with Republican voters on May 13 in Sioux Center, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses have traditionally held the nation\'s attention with the first contest of the presidential primary cycle. While Democrats have moved their first race to South Carolina, Republican voters will still look to Iowa as the first test of what\'s expected to be a crowded 2024 GOP field.\n\nGeneral admission tickets are $50 for adults and free for anyone 18 or under. Other donation levels run up to $6,600 for couples and $3,300 for individuals.\n\nPRO-DESANTIS SUPER PAC TOUTS $30 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL\n\nThis flyer obtained by Fox News Digital shows DeSantis will be making another stop in Iowa this year as the presidential cycle heats up\n\nFeenstra praised DeSantis\' conservative values in his own statement on the upcoming event.\n\n""While liberal states shut down their economies, forced businesses to close, and kept our kids out of the classroom, Governor DeSantis championed freedom and common sense. Florida -- like Iowa -- are clear examples of what strong conservative leadership can deliver for our country,"" the congressman, who also sits on the House Agriculture Committee, told Fox News Digital.\n\nDONALD TRUMP\'S CAMPAIGN URGES RON DESANTIS DONORS TO \'DEMONSTRATE\' LOYALTY TO FORMER PRESIDENT\n\nFeenstra\'s prior two ""family picnic"" fundraisers hosted former Vice President Mike Pence, who\'s widely expected to launch his own 2024 bid, and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, whose presidential campaign has struggled to get out of Trump\'s shadow.\n\nA source familiar with planning the event clarified that DeSantis\' invitation did not constitute an endorsement for 2024, but suggested that it signaled the Florida governor was very much still a possible White House contender. The source referred to Feenstra as a ""power broker"" in Iowa politics.\n\nRep. Randy Feenstra is hosting the Florida governor at his third annual Feenstra Family Picnic. (Rod Lamkey-Pool/Getty Images))\n\n""If you want to win in Iowa, talk to Randy Feenstra, because he is well liked,"" the source said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey explained, ""In the state of Iowa, as potential presidential candidates come through… Randy wants to be an ambassador to everybody and explain what\'s important to Iowa. You know, Iowans want a secure border. They want wasteful spending slashed and cut. They want someone that understands agriculture… I think Governor DeSantis represents that, and Randy certainly wants to welcome him and introduce him to Iowans who share those same values.""\n\nOther expected guests include Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Sen.

"Looking Out And In: Creating Positions For Talented People Sean Manning is CEO and Founder of Payroll Vault Franchising LLC, as well as a CPA, and Thought Leader in the Financial Field.\n\nGood employers want employees who are talented and capable. That's something I can say with certainty as the founder of a payroll and human resources solutions firm. I've seen companies looking to hire people as they grow or people to fill positions that others have vacated. In either case, finding the best people for the job is important.\n\nThe good news is that the job market has a lot of good, talented people looking for employment. For employers, the key to finding these people is to think about not only the company's needs but also the needs of prospective employees.\n\nBecause of the strain that the Covid-19 pandemic placed on many industries, many businesses have been put to the test for stability and the ability to provide job security for their staff. This is one of the biggest reasons I've seen that many employees are dissatisfied with their current jobs. When a company doesn't provide its staff with a sense of stability and a future that involves growth and opportunities for improvement, the staff may start looking elsewhere. Company leaders who want to find talented employees should demonstrate these qualities if they want people to feel their time and efforts aren't going to waste.\n\nShowing the company is motivated and confident in its future is only part of the formula for making attractive positions. Make sure you also back up your can-do attitude with a plan. A thought-out business plan should lay out your goals and what's needed to achieve them.\n\nOther elements that will help solidify the plan are a proposed timeline with milestones to achieve and a clear vision with an end goal for the plan. Additionally, ensure those who are conducting interviews for open positions are engaged with the company's long-term goals. This will give a good representation to the applicants of what they can expect when working for the company.\n\nWhen preparing the requirements for a position, there are two general ways to go about it. The first is to design the position with broad appeal. I've found this is one of the best methods if you want to present an image of growth and attract applicants who are dissatisfied with other employers. Keep the requirements open and easily accessible, without requiring large amounts of previous experience or specific training, licenses or certifications.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a position that you want to fill with a particular type of applicant, it's best to include specific qualifications to make the right applicants feel the position is tailor-made for people like them.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is where the best candidates for a position may come from. Every business has its own way of doing things, and one of the challenges of hiring someone from outside the company is bringing them up to speed. New hires for any position, from entry-level to a new upper manager, will need a breaking-in period as they get used to the day-to-day work.\n\nIf you need someone in a position who is ready to hit the ground running and start helping improve or grow the company, it may be best to look internally. Promoting from within the company ensures that whoever is picked is familiar with how things are done, and it can also improve employee morale and encourage company loyalty as employees see there's an opportunity for career advancement.\n\nWhen it comes to recruitment methods, they frequently change, but I've found traditional methods are still effective. Online advertisements, offering internal promotion, encouraging referrals through business partners and associates, and participation in industry conventions and expos are all viable ways to find qualified candidates.\n\nThe best way to find the right methods for your company's needs is to experiment. Be willing to try new approaches, like offering a signing bonus or restructuring an interview to accommodate your candidates.\n\nOne part of recruiting I highly recommend is for companies to avoid getting hung up on experience requirements, especially for entry-level positions. There are many talented candidates in the job market who are looking for their first job opportunity in a given industry or field.\n\nFor the companies seeking to grow, be willing to give candidates who display the drive to both improve and succeed, as well as the ability to fulfill a position's duties, an opportunity to prove themselves. Prior job experience is a good quality for candidates, but it shouldn't be required just for consideration.\n\nThere are exceptions to this advice, of course. It's not unreasonable to require some previous experience for positions that need considerable technical expertise. For these kinds of positions, apprenticeships or internships are often offered to get that experience.\n\nYou may want to try offering such training programs, as they can lead to the intern or apprentice taking on a full-time position with the company once they're done. This provides the added benefit of not only gaining on-the-job experience but also familiarity with the company's business practices.\n\nSince the pandemic began, the way many businesses work has changed dramatically and rapidly. Remote work, while not an unheard-of concept before, saw a huge boom in businesses that provided nonessential services that wanted to keep operating and avoid furloughing their staff. When the restrictions on travel and building occupation were lifted, many employees found they actually preferred working from home and were reluctant to return to an office environment.\n\nCompanies that adapt to changes in the average work environment and take employees' needs and preferences into consideration can present themselves as prime career opportunities to candidates with the skill and the drive to fulfill their responsibilities. Fair compensation for fair work, along with a stable job environment with opportunities for personal growth within the company are ingredients for positions good employees will want to stick with for the long run.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

"Employee Success Drives Customer Success: Turning To Your Employees First Wayne McCulloch is Chief Customer Officer at WalkMe, leading all post-sales functions, including customer success, service and support.\n\nPhilosophers, poets and psychologists have long offered the intuitive wisdom that personal success, with relationships or otherwise, starts by taking honest stock of what\'s going on inside of us. The same is true for understanding a business\'s success with customers or lack thereof. Customer success starts by looking inside the business to its biggest investment and primary driver: its people.\n\nIt may seem obvious that the employee experience shapes the customer experience and that employee empowerment, satisfaction and success will impact customer success. But those truths are commonly under-prioritized or siloed when business pressures mount. Sometimes they\'re entirely disregarded.\n\nAt Salesforce, at Google and now at WalkMe, I have written on the board in my first leadership team meeting the mantra: ""Customer success through employee success."" And I\'ve explained the practice that derives from it. In the initial months at an organization, although I\'m the customer success leader, I don\'t talk to customers. I spend all my time working with the team and making sure they have everything they need to be successful and empowered--tools, technology, methods, playbooks, training, compensation, mindset, enablement, ownership and more. Nothing else can be achieved if people don\'t have what they need and the space to use those things. In theory, most leaders know this, but they don\'t really know how to make it happen. Here are four strategic starting points.\n\nExecutives often think that they have risen to their position because they know how to solve problems, win business, manage people and develop processes and products better than anyone else. The buck stops with them, and they know best. That\'s why they are there, right? But the reality is they don\'t always know better because it\'s not their role to know everything. This can be a painful and humbling lesson to learn, but learn it, good leaders must. Failing to do so means missing out on opportunities to innovate and move quickly with people who should actually own the challenge of transforming the business.\n\nWhile leaders don\'t have all the answers, they should have a strategy to get honest insights from their people and implement plans that arise from those insights. The people doing the actual work--the heavy lifting--know what\'s working and what isn\'t. They hold the ideas and answers on how to transform the organization, how to build real value and how to keep customers and win new ones. It\'s the leader\'s job to offer a framework to realize those ideas, piece together all of a team\'s insights, help prioritize, remove obstacles and make sure budgets accommodate the needs.\n\nHow do you unlock the insights of people in your organization--those who already have the knowledge and a vision for customer success? In my first 30 days at WalkMe, I had 150 one-on-one conversations where 11 common themes emerged. Nearly all of them had to do with deficits around employee empowerment, not customers. But those deficits resulted in customer success not being at the level we wanted. The next step was to create 11 document workspaces so that everyone on the team, over five weeks, could join their chosen workspace and give unfiltered responses to four questions: What\'s the problem? What\'s the business value if we solve it? What does ""amazing"" look like? What\'s needed from me to get there?\n\nThe result was 500 pages of ideas coming from the people who best knew the problems and the business; their feedback included some of the most insightful, innovative and fantastically creative ways of solving problems I\'ve ever seen. The ideas were perfect for the maturity level of the company and for the relationships with customers. Key to this was hearing from everyone. Calls or roundtables won\'t give you that. Introverts who may feel embarrassed in live sessions and colleagues across all time zones were all able to share their views. Everyone had time to be thoughtful.\n\nThat one comprehensive exercise directly informed the plan for the whole year. It was the foundational solutions document. Not only was everyone given a meaningful voice through it, but they then had the opportunity to actually lead some of these initiatives to address the problems, yielding a measurable positive change in customer engagement and a big jump from where we were.\n\nBy having ownership over defining the problems, coming up with solutions and implementing their own ideas, employees will be more motivated to make those solutions work. Their ideas are on the line, not the leaders\'. This means there will be more passion and an ""all-in"" mentality, which is more likely to build lasting, positive change.\n\nGiving people ownership can\'t stop with an initial reset or one annual plan. It has to be dynamic as well. Business and economic circumstances are always changing. It\'s vital to make sure employees have the tools, data and flexibility they need to offer fresh thinking to solve unexpected problems and to help the organization pivot fast.\n\nFor example, with continuing uncertainty around a recession, customers can get nervous and feel like they have no choice but to cut their budgets and give up various SaaS products. A good strategy to meet their needs and not lose business long-term is to empower your renewals team to get creative. Allow them to counsel the customer and find creative, specific ways to help them achieve productivity using the SaaS solution. As a leader, work with finance and legal on unique ways to help customers that your team suggests.\n\nInvesting in your team and genuinely empowering them to be accomplished in their positions yields a robust pipeline of solutions for customers, flowing with creativity that keeps your business innovative and viable. Employee success truly drives customer success.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

"Ukraine says Russia 'worse than ISIS' after beheading video Ukrainian officials have condemned Russian forces after a video circulating on social media appeared to show the beheading of a Ukrainian prisoner with a knife.\n\nAl Jazeera was not able to independently verify the authenticity of the video, which spread quickly online.\n\nThe footage shows a man in uniform beheading a man who wears the yellow arm band used by Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThe video is heavily blurred and contains a voice at the beginning, which suggests that the victim might have still been alive when the attack began.\n\nThe Kremlin described the video as ""awful"" and said its authenticity needed to be checked.

"What will post-Djukanovic Montenegro look like? On April 2, Montenegro held a landmark presidential run-off that saw 36-year-old former Economy Minister Jakov Milatovic declare victory against longstanding incumbent Milo Djukanovic.\n\nDjukanovic\'s ousting from power raised important questions about the future direction of the small Balkan country and its commitment to a pro-Western course.\n\nSixty-one-year-old Djukanovic was a fixture of Montenegro\'s politics for more than three decades. An economist by training, he first became Montenegro\'s prime minister back in early 1991 at the young age of 29. Since then, he almost always remained at the helm of Montenegro, alternating between serving as prime minister and president. Even during the brief periods he was officially out of government, there had been little doubt, both in Montenegro and abroad, that Djukanovic maintained control over the country\'s affairs.\n\nDjukanovic\'s early political career was riddled with controversy. When he first entered the political scene in the early 1990s, he was a close ally of Serbia\'s Slobodan Milošević and was right by his side when he embarked on bloody wars of aggression against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1991-92, Djukanovic\'s cabinet actively supported the months-long siege of Dubrovnik which devastated the historical coastal city and claimed many civilian lives. In the spring of 1992, at the beginning of the Bosnian war, Montenegrin police arrested more than 60 mostly Bosniak refugees in the western coastal town of Herceg Novi and handed them over to Bosnian Serb troops. Only a few survived. Numerous Montenegrin soldiers and volunteers went on to participate in atrocities in Bosnia. All this took place under Djukanovic\'s leadership.\n\nIn the late-1990s, however, the Montenegrin leader realised that the tide was turning against Milošević and swiftly turned his back on the Serbian leader. He distanced himself from policies supported by Milošević, dropped pro-Serb talking points, embraced Montenegrin nationalism and slowly reinvented himself as an independently-minded, pro-Western reformer.\n\nDjukanovic led his country out of the Serbia-Montenegro Union in 2006 with a referendum and made ensuring the newly independent nation\'s accession to leading Western institutions his political priority.\n\nMontenegro officially applied for European Union membership in 2008 and accession talks started in 2012. With 33 chapters opened and three conditionally closed, the country has gone the furthest in the European integration process among the remaining post-Yugoslav states that are still not part of the union. Montenegro also joined NATO in June 2017.\n\nOver the years, Djukanovic\'s early days as a Milošević ally have mostly been forgotten and his rule in Montenegro came to be seen as a positive one guided by a pro-European vision.\n\nAnd to his credit, he did put Montenegro on the path to becoming a peaceful, prosperous and well-integrated European nation. He built constructive ties with all of Montenegro\'s neighbours and recognised Kosovo\'s independence in 2008. Ethnic minorities in Montenegro, including Bosniaks and Albanians, have largely been content with the rights they have been given under his rule. He also approved Montenegro paying compensation to the relatives of Bosniak refugees it deported in 1992. In 2021, Montenegro\'s parliament adopted a resolution condemning the Srebrenica genocide and banning its denial.\n\nOf course, Djukanovic\'s time in power has not been entirely without controversy. He has repeatedly been accused of corruption and faced criticism for his alleged links to organised crime. He was featured in the Pandora Papers and faced allegations of money laundering. He has also been criticised at home and abroad for his attacks on independent journalists.\n\nNevertheless, as the leader who made Montenegro\'s independence possible, entered it into NATO and put it on a direct path to full EU membership, Djukanovic\'s presidency seemed as secure as can be until very recently.\n\nHowever, things started to change for the seasoned politician in August 2020.\n\nAt the end of a fiercely fought parliamentary election, his Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) got the most votes but failed to secure a large enough majority to form a government on its own. Dritan Abazović, a young populist hellbent on loosening Djukanovic\'s grip on Montenegrin politics, emerged as kingmaker and formed alliances with pro-Serbian and pro-Russian political fractions to keep DPS out of government. After a brief stint as deputy prime minister in Zdravko Krivokapić\'s government, Abazović became prime minister in April 2022.\n\nAs the prime minister of a broad coalition of nominally pro-European but in reality pro-Serbian parties, Abazović promised to tackle corruption, implement reforms that would speed up Montenegro\'s accession to the EU, and pursue policies to ensure good relations with all of the country\'s neighbours. Despite his declared reformist and pro-European agenda, however, many in Montenegro viewed Abazović as serving no other purpose than fostering the conditions for the ousting of the long-term president – to the benefit of Serbia and Russia.\n\nAnd soon they were proved right.\n\nAs Montenegro went to presidential elections in a state of political turmoil with Abazović himself suffering a vote of no confidence in August 2022, Djukanovic finally lost his grip on power.\n\nIn the first round of the election, Djukanovic got 35.3 percent of the vote, while his government-supported rival Milatovic, who campaigned on a promise to improve Montenegro\'s ties with both Europe and Serbia, got 29.2 percent. Then, in last week\'s run-off, all the anti-Djukanovic forces in the country – including those working to steer it away from Europe and closer to Serbia and Russia – united behind his rival and carried him to the presidency.\n\nMilatović\'s resounding victory marked the likely end of Djukanovic\'s long and impactful political career. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for June this year but the veteran politician is highly unlikely to be able to secure another comeback.\n\nWhat happens next in Montenegro is subject to much speculation in the Balkans and beyond. Whether Djukanovic will contest the next elections or not remains uncertain. More crucially, there are vital questions about the direction in which Milatović will take the small but strategically important Balkan nation of 600,000.\n\nAs an economist who studied in the United States and holds a master\'s degree from Oxford University, Milatović no doubt has experience in the West. In his victory speech, he made a pledge to make the country a full member of the EU in five years. He also promised a new chapter in relations with all of Montenegro\'s neighbours.\n\nConspicuously, however, the president-elect failed to mention the new administration\'s continued commitment to NATO. In fact, he did little to reassure those worried about the influence the pro-Serbian and pro-Russian forces that brought him to power may have over his presidency.\n\nBefore his ouster, Djukanovic had warned that Serbia is seeking to establish a ""Serbian world"" where it would exert control over all Balkan states with historic links to Serbia, including Montenegro.\n\nWith Serb nationalists celebrating Djukanovic\'s ousting across the Balkans and Milatović declaring his ambition to strengthen ties with Serbia, it appears, at least for now, that the change in leadership in Montenegro will help Belgrade\'s ambitions for regional hegemony. It was telling that Milatović\'s supporters celebrated his victory by waving Serbian flags.\n\nOf course, only time will tell whether Milatović will do what is expected of him and bring his country closer to Serbia. But for now, it seems there is more reason than ever before to worry about Montenegro\'s commitment to the West and the stability of its neighbourhood.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\'s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\'s editorial stance. https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/4/12/what-will-post-djukanovic-montenegro-look-like"
"Destiny 2's Ada-1 Is Currently Selling The Best Shader She's Going To Sell Destiny 2 has mercifully decided to start bringing dozens of old shaders into the modern era of the game that were previously inaccessible. Some of these are acquired by running Vanguard Ops, Crucible, Gambit or even Iron Banner, but others are being sold on a weekly rotating basis by Ada-1, the ex-Black Armory steward and current transmog vendor.\n\nWell, right now Ada-1 has headed back to her Black Armory roots, and she is selling what I would say is probably the best shader in her current overall inventory. That would be the year two Black Armory shader Bergusian Night.\n\nIt\'s a purple shader and black that actually looks good, and one of the game\'s first few experiments with motion shaders, as were some of the other Black Armory ones. This one is special with its shimmering, moving texture that if you look closely, has symbols of the Armory houses cascading through it. It\'s a great pick-up for Void builds in particular, if you are trying to stay on color theme.\n\nI think the only way to get this shader back in the day was to get a curated drop of a Black Armory weapon which would drop with this shader already on it, then you\'d dismantle it in order to add this shader to your collection. I believe this was also back in the ""consumable shader"" days so this was pretty rare and valuable, at least until they put consumable shaders in collections finally.\n\nAda-1 rotates her shaders on a weekly basis, so you will have until next Tuesday reset to get this. But I figured I would post something now so you had plenty of time to go pick it up. Many players have been missing this shader for literally years, as either they didn\'t get it back during the Black Armory era, or they weren\'t playing back then, which is understandable. The other House-based Black Armory shaders and the one rare-level black one are good as well, when she sells those.\n\nAs ever, Destiny 2 players are waiting for the return of Black Armory weapons to the game\'s arsenal, which were sunset during Beyond Light, and unlike other sunset weapons, none of the collection has returned with a new power cap and new perks. Bungie has previously said that bringing old weapons back would have to align with the story in some way, which is rough, given that the Black Armory is a pretty minor footnote in the grand scope of Destiny 2 history, but we\'ll see. For now, just get the shader.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.

"Serial Entrepreneur/Restaurateur/Investor Tony Park Diversifies By Opening A Korean Steakhouse In NYC Anto in Manhattan is serial entrepreneur Tony Park\'s take on a distinctive Korean steakhouse.\n\nSerial entrepreneur and restaurateur Tony Park, who is 45-years-old and New York City-based, owns the following: two bakeries (with more to come), a cocktail bar, a full-service Korean BBQ restaurant and he just opened a Korean steakhouse. Formulas haven\'t particularly worked for Park who is driven by his own independent spirit.\n\nPark has diversified roots in New York City eateries. He served as real-estate manager for Paris Baguette and Essen, and then was an investor in them, which both expanded. But prior to the Covid pandemic, he sold his interests to capitalize the opening of Angelina\'s Bakery.\n\nPark\'s restaurant group, QB Hospitality includes two Angelina\'s Bakery, in Times Square and the Garment District, and is looking to franchise and adding six new outlets this year. He also runs Antoya BBQ, a Korean BBQ restaurant, located in proximity to the Empire State Building, Katherine, a cocktail bar, and now Anto, a Korean steakhouse, which opened in March 2023. Angelina\'s is named after his daughter, Katherine, after his wife, and Anto, after his son.\n\nAn enterprising entrepreneur Tony Park is now starting to franchise his restaurant concepts to further expansion.\n\nPark also owns PD Properties, a real-estate firm, that he explained ""formed the backbone of our hospitality group."" Its profits enable him to ""finance our food and beverage business through the real estate that we purchased during Covid,"" he said. Acquired at bargain prices, the real-estate has been proliferating in value.\n\nIn fact, he said, the real-estate often dictates what kind of restaurant specialty he develops. ""Certain locations demand a certain kind of restaurant,"" he asserted.\n\nFor example, Katherine, a cocktail bar, on West 35th is on a block with five or six hotels, and is therefore frequented by tourists, where two old-time bars closed due to the pandemic. Hence, the block demanded another bar, he suggested.\n\nHe acknowledged that marketing so many brands makes it more difficult. ""I\'d rather not do it. But I\'ve had to make tough choices,"" he revealed. But in pricey Manhattan, real-estate has a way of exerting undue influence.\n\nAll of these diverse restaurant enterprises were self-financed by Park, without having to reach out to angel investors, venture capitalists or private equity, enabling him to have full control. But now things are changing.\n\nWhen Park adds six new Angelina\'s Bakery in New York City, they will be franchised. Why franchise? The demand was there, he suggested. ""We\'ve been getting four or five emails a day. I decided not to run them all, but teach others to run it"" he said.\n\nAngelina\'s Bakery operates like an Italian bakery where bread is baked in-house daily, not prepared at a central kitchen. ""People like to see their croissants coming out of the oven,"" he said. ""They\'re harder to run,"" he admitted, because of that reliance on fresh baking.\n\nComing soon is a franchised Angelina\'s Bakery in downtown Brooklyn, and then in Grand Central, Port Authority, Bryant Park and in NoMad, all extremely highly-trafficked locations.\n\nHe\'s also looking to franchise Antoya\'s BBQ, which has two locations under construction, though that will take six to eight months to play out. Franchising makes sense for expansion, Park noted, because ""we have a system and template that we can duplicate. We know what sells and what doesn\'t, with a well-proven concept.""\n\nHe opened Anto restaurant, a Korean steakhouse on East 58th Street, despite the fact that Midtown Manhattan is filled with steakhouses including Smith & Wollensky, Gallagher\'s Steakhouse, Ruth\'s Chris Steak House, Wolfgang\'s Steakhouse. So why debut another?\n\nPark replied that Anto ""brings a culturally-grounded Korean steakhouse to New York City diners. While there are many steakhouses in the city, Anto is an opportunity to introduce and educate New Yorkers on the ingredients and traditions of the Korean table.""\n\nKorean food and culture, he said, are extremely popular and trendy. ""Look at the TV series \'Squid Games,\' he noted.\n\nOperating so many independent eateries and several bakeries takes a village. Park noted that ""Across our team, we have seasoned and experienced hospitality management professionals,"" whom he depends on to make the varied eateries operate effectively.\n\nAnd what does it take to be so successful at real-estate, investing and operating restaurants? ""A lot of sacrifice in your personal life,"" Park admitted, including ""a lot of working from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. six days a week. https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystern/2023/04/12/serial-entrepreneurrestaurateurinvestor-tony-park-diversifies-by-opening-a-korean-steakhouse-in-nyc/"

"Conflict in eastern DR Congo forces thousands of schools to close Thomas Tumusifu Buregeya wishes he were studying for his final school exams. Instead, he scrapes a living doing odd jobs in a displaced people\'s camp in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo after a wave of rebel violence upended his life yet again.\n\nBuregeya fled the town of Kibumba with his family in October amid a renewed offensive by the March 23 Movement (M23) rebel group – the third time in 15 years he has been forced to escape his home – and has not been able to study for a whole year. He is now 22 and still waiting to complete school.\n\n""When from this camp I see … finalists like me, it makes my heart ache, I wonder when I will finish my studies, the years are going by,"" he said.\n\nHe is one of the 750,000 young Congolese whose schooling is currently disrupted by insecurity caused by multiple armed groups in the eastern provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, the United Nations children\'s agency (UNICEF) estimated in late March.\n\nFor months, Kinshasa has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 group making incursions into the DRC\'s east, increasing tensions between the neighbours.\n\nThe conflict in the region has gone on for decades, with more than 100 armed groups fighting for control of valuable mineral resources while others protect their communities, and has triggered an exodus of refugees.\n\nKigali in turn accuses the DRC of supporting the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), another rebel group based in the DRC that has carried out raids into Rwanda in the past.\n\nThe FDLR has been accused of participation in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which ethnic Hutus killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus who tried to protect them.\n\nLast year, United Nations experts said they had ""substantial evidence"" of Rwandan government forces crossing into the DRC to reinforce M23 rebels or to conduct operations against the FDLR.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have urged Rwanda to stop supporting the rebels.\n\nThe Rwandan government has denied supporting M23 and says the accusations are part of a ""tired old blame game"" undermining efforts for peace, ""to which Rwanda is fully committed"".\n\nIn the small camp next to an evangelical church outside the provincial capital Goma, Buregeya spends his time leaning against the tin wall of the church or playing cards with school friends also displaced from Kibumba.\n\nSince January 2022, some 2,100 schools in eastern DRC have had to close because of armed conflict, according to UNICEF.\n\nThe damage could be lasting. Without access to education, children and young people can miss the chance to develop the skills needed to escape poverty and overcome the desperate economic challenges that help increase conflict in places such as mineral-rich eastern DRC, according to a 2011 UN report on global education and armed conflict.\n\nBuregeya fears time is running out for him.\n\n""My life\'s dream was to go to university after high school, to look for a job, become a teacher and earn a living,"" he said. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/conflict-in-eastern-dr-congo-forces-thousands-of-schools-to-close"

"15 Tips To Explain Your Business Development Ideas Clearly During A Pitch Party For entrepreneurs, pitch parties can be the perfect opportunity to showcase their business development ideas to potential investors, clients and partners. However, with only a few minutes to make a lasting impression, it is crucial to prepare thoroughly and present your ideas clearly and effectively.\n\nPitch parties can be intimidating, and without proper preparation, you risk losing the opportunity to make an impact. Below, a panel of Forbes Business Development Council members shares tips and strategies to help you prepare for a pitch party and deliver a clear and compelling message about your business development ideas.\n\nEnsure the pitch follows an insight-driven approach--here\'s how the world is changing; these are issues people like you are facing; here are key insights to your problems; this is how we can help and propose some next steps. Pause and breathe before you start. - Michael Smith, Sonendo\n\nWe rely heavily on experimentation and optimization because it is core to how we collaborate with our target enterprise customers. It is true no customer is the same. A critical element of our preparation is formalizing the hypothesis outlining the concepts and ideas we are proposing, which serves as a forcing function for our team to think critically about the approach, ideas and expected outcomes. - Dave Paprocki, MetaRouter\n\nKnow your audience. Research the profile of your audience. Figure out what matters to them and why. Knowing our audience helps us to prepare concise and differentiated value propositions to explain business development ideas clearly. Shorter pitches can pique the audience\'s interest, create opportunities for follow-up questions and ultimately call to action. - Chor Meng Tan, Wiley\n\nKeep your end goal in mind and remember not to take yourself too seriously. Conduct research, prepare and practice leading up to the pitch. Keep your message simple and focused. You will typically receive feedback from your peers, not actual customers. This means you can validate your ideas to an unbiased audience who will help you better prepare for the main event. - Stuart Bern, ATTOM\n\nRemember a pitch party is just that: a party, not a sales meeting. It\'s all about people, so take time to find out who they are. Get to know them and think about how there might be chemistry for collaboration because, without that, a relationship could struggle. Be sensitive to the people you could be working with, listen to their ideas respectfully and treat them as you would like to be treated. - Anna Jankowska, RTB House\n\nForbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives. Do I qualify?\n\nAlways start with your end customer in mind. First, figure out what the client challenge or landscape trend is. Then, challenge the proposed solution. Next, determine how the solution will benefit the client and you. Finally, decide what needs to happen to make this come to life. Be clear and concise. If the idea is not clear, the idea needs to be refined. - Stephanie Gorski, Accenture\n\nThe best way to prepare for a pitch party is first to know your audience, tailor your presentation to their needs and make it more engaging and relevant. Then practice and rehearse your pitch multiple times until you\'re confident and comfortable with the material. This will help you build confidence and ensure you deliver your ideas clearly and effectively. - Lomit Patel, Tynker\n\nFirst, you want to explain what your product does and how it benefits your customer. Next, you want to be clear about your target customer and define who your ideal customer is and why they would benefit from your product or service. And lastly, you want to be clear about your positioning and how it differentiates your product or service from competitors\' offerings. - Wayne Elsey, The Funds2Orgs Group\n\nIt doesn\'t really matter how good you might be at public speaking; if you throw the wrong pitch at the wrong crowd, it won\'t have the desired outcome. Starting a pitch with qualification questions is essential because that should identify the demographics of the room. The best communicators will then adjust the pitch accordingly to match the crowd. It is essential to match a pitch to the listener. - Peter Schravemade, REACH ASEA\n\nBegin with the end in mind. What result do you want from the pitch party? Identify the target audience and decision-makers. Target your pitch to meet their needs. Support that pitch with evidence-based research. Practice in front of a ""hostile"" audience that will ask hard questions and challenge your answers and presentation. - Michael Fritsch, Smarter Operations\n\nGet straight to the point. Attentions are short and your time to pitch may be shorter if you don\'t lead with the key benefit first. Lead with the benefit, grab their attention and then build up to how you will carry out your goal. Buzzwords can work but are too commonly overused these days. Try using alternative, more attractive words that will make you sound unique and a more in-touch expert. - David Strausser, SEIDOR USA\n\nResearch the audience and tailor your pitch to meet their needs and interests. Develop a clear and concise message that focuses on the key points of your business development idea. Keep the visuals simple, and make sure they support your message rather than detract from it. Finally, practice your pitch several times before the event to ensure that you can deliver it confidently and effectively. - Gautam Vij, AlertEnterprise\n\nBe adaptable in your pitch and approach. Everyone you ask this question will talk about preparation, audience research and ""what\'s in it for them,"" but at the same time, go with a flexible approach of an alternative plan, too. The level of their status and not leaving their comfort zone are also reasons why people resist making decisions, so be open to tweaking your message in a way that makes it even easier for your audience to take action. - Mustansir Paliwala, EQUANS\n\nResearch the audience and understand their needs and interests. Clearly defining the value proposition sets businesses apart and solves problems to meet needs in a unique way. Use a compelling story--people remember stories more than facts. Be concise, highlight important aspects and use simple language. Use visual aids to make the pitch memorable. Practice, be confident and comfortable. Prepare to answer questions and understand all aspects of the business. - Dhiraj Chhabra, BuzzClan\n\nNever underestimate the power of a short, inspiring and compelling brief. I love the 5 W\'s framework: who, what, why, where and which. Who are we trying to engage? What are we trying to engage them with? Why would they care (my favorite)? Where would they be most receptive to my message or pitch? Which metrics would define success or failure (the fewer, the better)? - Nivi Chakravorty, MyRegistry https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2023/04/12/15-tips-to-explain-your-business-development-ideas-clearly-during-a-pitch-party/"
"Lamborghini Revuelto or how to sell an emotion Editor\'s note: This is the second part of a two-part series. Check our initial impressions of the Lamborghini Revuelto here.\n\nBuying a supercar. What\'s it really like?\n\nFor the uninitiated, it may sound something the super-rich do on a whim. In reality, however, it often involves a lot of careful planning and obsessing over every detail of your new, ultra pricy, ultra lightweight, ultra fast plaything. And then you have to wait until it arrives, sometimes for years.\n\nOn the manufacturer\'s side, producing the car requires spending a lot of human work hours, with highly skilled laborers making sure every detail of the car\'s interior and exterior is perfect, and tuned to the future owner\'s desires.\n\nShortly after revealing the new Lamborghini Revuelto, the company\'s first-ever hybrid supercar, the company took journalists for a tour around the factory, where the production of the Revuelto is being ramped up before deliveries to customers can start.\n\nIf I had to describe Lamborghini\'s production line in one word, it would be precision. In one part of the factory, lumps of carbon fiber are being molded and laminated to create the Revuelto\'s ultra-light monocoque. In another, the vehicle\'s dizzyingly complex, new hybrid drivetrain is being painstakingly put together. In some areas, we are forbidden to take photos; some are completely off limits, and we can only see them from afar.\n\nAttention to detail and respect for the fancy materials used in the construction of a supercar are on display at every corner. Here\'s an example: The nappa leather that will be used in a car\'s interior is first inspected in a large machine, equipped with four projectors and electronic pens, that lets the worker mark the parts that need to be cut without even touching the leather. The leather then goes into an automatic cutting machine, with knives that descend from above and precisely remove the marked bits. I ask, why go to such trouble to cut the leather? The answer from one of the company\'s engineers is: Lamborghini wants to make sure the leather isn\'t tarnished in any way.\n\nThe company\'s execs keep reminding us how highly skilled the workers in the factory are. You can\'t just start working on an actual Lamborghini on your first day on the job; some roles require weeks of specialized training; for some, workers have to train a minimum of six months before they can begin.\n\nLamborghini buyers can choose from a variety of color combinations both for the car\'s exterior and interior, and they can also pick minute details such as custom images stitched onto the seats. In one part of the factory, we glimpse another way in which the customers get to feel special: a massive table is prepared for a dinner for the first Revuelto buyers, who get to enjoy fine Italian food whilst looking at the innards of their semi-assembled, future Lambos.\n\nIn the Revuelto, the customization is extended onto the car\'s infotainment system. Lamborghinis of old haven\'t had a lot of displays; the multitude of knobs and switches you\'ll find in an Aventador are there to evoke the feeling of being in a race car or, perhaps, a rocket.\n\nThe Revuelto still has its fair share of physical gizmos to press, but it also has three displays: one for the pilot (that\'s the driver), another for the copilot (that\'s the passenger), and a center display that\'s pretty much what you\'ll find in most modern cars -- displaying incoming calls, climate controls, and media details. It can all be customized by dragging, dropping, and rearranging various items with simple touch gestures. Yes, it\'s not exactly unheard of (Lamborghini\'s newer Huracans have a similar, albeit smaller, center display), but for Lamborghini\'s flagship car, it\'s a massive leap forward. Apple CarPlay as well as Android Auto support is here, I\'ve been told, and if you want to talk to your Lambo, you\'ll be speaking to Amazon\'s Alexa, which is the only voice assistant on board.\n\nI asked Lamborghini\'s CTO, Rouven Mohr, about the car\'s hybrid drivetrain and the screen-friendly interior, and whether these could alienate the company\'s long-time supporters. ""Our customers know that this is the path forward. But trust me, the Revuelto is still very much a Lamborghini,"" he told me. All of the traits that make the Lambo a Lambo -- the nutty acceleration, the growling sound, the outrageous design -- are still here, Mohr assured me. And the most important part of a Lamborghini, the emotion that it incites, is more powerful than ever, he added.\n\nWe finish the day with a set of interviews with Lamborghini\'s execs next to yet another Revuelto posing for photographs. Sitting inside its incredibly low-positioned seat and playing with its gadgets, it\'s easy to forget that this thing isn\'t something that most people, including me, will be able to buy. Still, the Revuelto, which starts at about $600,000, is selling like hot cakes(Opens in a new tab). If you want one, and have the cash to buy it, you\'ll have to wait about two years to get it. Fantasizing about owning one, as always, is free. https://mashable.com/article/lamborghini-revuelto-customization-infotainment"

"How to stay safe on dating apps Staying safe when using dating apps is imperative. Apps like Tinder have implemented their own safety features, but if you\'re going to chat with and potentially meet strangers, it\'s important to know the ins and outs of keeping yourself safe in the digital world and IRL. Some of these tips come from RAINN(Opens in a new tab), the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.\n\nFirst off, don\'t sign up with a dating app using a social media account like Facebook or Instagram. Previously, Bumble only had the option to sign up through Facebook. Thankfully, that\'s no more, and you can sign up for Bumble with your phone number(Opens in a new tab). In fact, for other popular apps as well like Tinder(Opens in a new tab), Hinge(Opens in a new tab), and OkCupid(Opens in a new tab), you can sign up with a phone number or email.\n\nThat\'s good news, because if you sign up with social media, it allows data from either platform to be exchanged with each other. This is why if you signed up with your Instagram account, for instance, matches may show up as recommended people to follow. While it\'s tempting to sign up through a social platform and let it populate your profile for you, it allows this exchange of data.\n\n""By connecting Instagram to your profile, you\'re giving Meta all the data points necessary to connect these people together on Instagram,"" said Tim Maliyil, founder of encryption and mobile security service AlertBoot(Opens in a new tab). He himself has seen women from dating sites pop up on Instagram.\n\nAnother component is photos; when you sign up through a social account, the dating app will likely use pictures from said account. This can make it easy for potential matches to find you elsewhere online. Therefore, in addition to signing up with an email or phone number, use different photos than are on your social media.\n\nIf you\'re still concerned about people finding your social media profiles, lock them or adjust privacy settings(Opens in a new tab).\n\nBe diligent when looking at fellow singles\' profiles. If they\'re verified (a feature which Tinder, Bumble(Opens in a new tab), Hinge(Opens in a new tab), and OkCupid(Opens in a new tab) have), then you know this person looks like their pictures. But if they don\'t have a photo, or only have one, and they\'re not verified, that might be a red flag.\n\nIf they appear too-good-to-be-true -- aka their photos look like magazine ads -- you can screenshot someone\'s profile and reverse image search to see if someone is potentially catfishing, or lying about who they are online. If you think something fishy is going on, report the user to the app (which will probably give you the option to block, as well).\n\nIf their Facebook or Instagram account is connected, you can take advantage and look them up. Do they have a new, sparce Facebook account with two friends, as opposed to a decade-old account with schools listed and hundreds of connections? You\'ll probably want to swipe left on the former.\n\nWant more sex and dating stories in your inbox? Sign up for Mashable\'s new weekly After Dark newsletter.\n\nA big red flag is if a match wants to immediately hop off the app and talk elsewhere -- or, worse, if they immediately want to meet up. Stick to chatting on the app at first. For one, scammers can use your phone number(Opens in a new tab) to impersonate you. For another, if a match goes south, it\'ll be a relief that they don\'t have your number. There\'s no rush!\n\nBesides wanting to meet up immediately, another red flag is if they never want to meet nor video chat. This could be the work of a romance scammer, who pretends to be someone else on dating apps in order to get people to send them money.\n\nFor this reason, never share personal information (i.e. your bank account details) and don\'t send money to a match. If someone is on the app for the reason you are -- to date! -- they won\'t ask for either.\n\nIf you\'re chatting with someone and feel uncomfortable (say if they\'re too forward) feel free to unmatch and/or report them.\n\nAs Mashable culture reporter Meera Navlakha advised, video chat before going on a date. Some apps, like Tinder, even have functions to do this in-app so you don\'t have to exchange phone numbers. By video chatting beforehand, you can assure your date is who they say they are -- and you may even find out if the chemistry isn\'t there, which would save you both time on an IRL date!\n\nIf the video date goes off without a hitch, it\'s time to meet in person. Meet in a public place, and tell your support system (family, friends) where you are; you can even turn on your location for them so they can know exactly where you are.\n\nDon\'t rely on the date for transportation, so you can leave on your own accord if you\'re feeling uncomfortable. You\'re free to enlist the help of a bartender or server if something is wrong, too.\n\nTrust your gut. If you\'re getting a funny feeling from this date, you can leave. As RAINN asserts, don\'t worry about coming off as ""rude""; your safety comes first!\n\nRemember that you can always pause your dating apps if you\'re not enjoying them, or delete the profiles altogether. Staying safe trumps racking up matches any day. https://mashable.com/article/how-to-stay-safe-dating-apps"

"Prices Rose Another 5% In March--Lowest Inflation Reading In Nearly Two Years Annual inflation fell for a ninth-straight month in March--temporarily easing concerns about the future of the Federal Reserve\'s tightening campaign as some experts worry lower global oil production and uncertainty over recent bank failures may complicate the path of inflation.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.\n\nConsumer prices rose 5% on an annual basis, according to data released by the Labor Department on Wednesday, marking the smallest year-over-year increase since May 2021 and coming in better than economists expected after a 6% spike in February.\n\nRent prices were ""by far"" the biggest contributor to overall inflation, more than offsetting a decline in energy prices, which decreased 3.5% over the month, the government said.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4% on a monthly basis in March--falling in line with projections but still historically high as prices for car insurance, airplane tickets, furniture and new cars all continued to rise.\n\nStock futures spiked immediately after the data, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq erasing early morning losses to trade up 0.7% and 1.2% by 8:45 a.m. ET, respectively.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates up to the highest level in 15 years in order to help temper inflation that remains well above the central bank\'s historical 2% target. The labor market has started to show signs of weakening, and already the economic tightening has fueled a housing market correction, stock market downturn and just last month, a batch of high-profile bank failures. Nevertheless, officials have hinted they may not be done hiking rates, forecasting at least one more increase in their latest meeting on March 22.\n\n""Investors are increasingly concerned that the Fed\'s overtightening... could steer the U.S. economy into a recession,"" says Green, noting interest rate changes can take up to 18 months to ripple through the economy, slowing more rate-sensitive sectors (like housing and tech) first before spreading to others.

"Syria to reopen embassy in Tunisia after 10-year closure War-torn Syria will reopen its diplomatic mission in Tunisia and appoint an ambassador there, Damascus and Tunis say in a joint statement.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday came after more than a decade of strained ties.\n\nSyria\'s decision followed a similar move by Tunisia on April 3 when President Kais Saied instructed his foreign minister to begin procedures to appoint an ambassador to Damascus.\n\n""In response to the initiative of the President of the Tunisian Republic, … the Syrian government … decided to reopen the Syrian embassy in Tunisia and to appoint an ambassador soon,"" the joint statement said, according to SANA, Syria\'s official news agency.\n\n""Out of both sides\' keenness to restore the Syrian-Tunisian relations to their normal track, consultation and coordination are ongoing between the foreign ministers … to further consolidate the deep-rooted ties of brotherhood binding Syria and Tunisia,"" the statement added.\n\nSaied had said last month that he planned to restore diplomatic relations with Syria.\n\nTunisia\'s move is the latest example of Arab outreach to the internationally isolated government in Damascus. Engagement with Syria has gathered pace since it and Turkey were hit by devastating earthquakes in February.\n\nSince the disaster, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has received calls and aid from Arab leaders, momentum that analysts say he could leverage to bolster regional support.\n\nThis year, al-Assad has visited Oman and the United Arab Emirates, which restored ties with Damascus in 2018. Last month, Saudi Arabia said it had started talks with Damascus about resuming consular services.\n\nTunisia expelled Syria\'s ambassador in 2012 over the al-Assad government\'s repression of peaceful protesters that triggered more than a decade of civil war. About half a million Syrians have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.\n\nThe Syrian government was bolstered when Russia intervened on its side in the war in 2015. It has since regained control over much of the territory it lost in the early stages of the conflict.\n\nThe two countries\' diplomatic rupture, undertaken when former President Moncef Marzouki was still in office, was strongly criticised by the Tunisian opposition at the time.\n\nIn 2015, Tunisia took a step towards re-establishing relations when it designated a consular representative to Damascus to ""follow"" the situation of Tunisians in Syria.\n\nNine Arab countries are set to meet in Saudi Arabia this week to discuss moves to end al-Assad\'s isolation.\n\nThe Arab League, which suspended Syria in 2011, is expected to hold a summit in Riyadh in May. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/syria-to-reopen-tunisia-embassy-following-10-year-closure"

"A Rising Factory Tide in US and China Won't Lift All Boats A rewiring of the world\'s factory supply chain is taking hold as companies contend with sharpened geopolitical fissures, a new era for industrial policy and an increased focus on resiliency. But this revamping is happening against a backdrop of uncertain economic conditions and a surge in the cost of the capital needed to fund such investment. Small and medium-sized manufacturers in the US and China are particularly vulnerable to these growing, divergent pressures and are at risk of becoming collateral damage.\n\nThe factory renaissance in North America is real: Melius Research has tabulated some $380 billion of ""mega-projects"" -- defined as an investment greater than $1 billion -- with almost 60% of those planned facilities already breaking ground. There\'s more to come with a huge influx of US government stimulus aimed at infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductors still filtering its way down to specific projects. China, meanwhile, is pushing billions of dollars of infrastructure investment as companies seek to support a domestic recovery after the end of Covid-Zero policies while grappling with slowing overseas demand and weak balance sheets. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-12/a-rising-factory-tide-in-us-and-china-won-t-lift-all-boats"
"The Environmental Protection Agency proposes stricter vehicle emission rules The Biden-Harris administration has proposed stricter pollution standards across the auto industry as part of their goal to increase EV production and slow climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency\'s (EPA) new guidelines would mean that, by 2032, 67 percent of new light-duty vehicles, such as sedans and light trucks, and 46 percent of new medium-duty vehicles sold will be EVs. The proposed changes could also lead to almost 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions to be avoided through 2055 -- about double the US\'s 2022 emissions.\n\nDetails on the proposed emissions standards aren\'t fully clear, but are set to include targets for EV sales and new rules that punish automakers who exceed CO2 standards within the next five to ten years. ""Specifically, EPA is proposing stronger CO2 standards for MY 2027 HD vehicles that go beyond the current standards that apply under the HD Phase 2 Greenhouse Gas program,"" the agency said in a statement. ""EPA is also is proposing an additional set of CO2 standards for HD vehicles that would begin to apply in MY 2028, with progressively lower standards each model year through 2032.""\n\nThis year has already seen continued progress for EV manufacturing and sales. Tesla reported increased first quarter sales that were 36 percent higher than the same period in 2022, and four percent higher than the last quarter. Volkswagen pledged $193 billion dollars towards EV technology, including batteries and raw materials, over the next five years.\n\nEV purchases are clearly heading in the direction the Biden administration hopes: EV sales accounted for 5.6 percent in 2022, compared to 1.8 percent in 2020. In California, EVs made up almost 19 percent of yearly new car sales. That upswing is set to continue in 2023 with 225,000 EVs sold in the first quarter -- about seven percent of all new vehicles. The same period saw used EV purchases increase by almost a third, thanks potentially to their prices decreasing.\n\nGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\'s editorial team.

Last year, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, providing EV buyers subsidies up to $7,500 for SUVs, trucks, and vans under $80,000 and cars under $55,000. Even used EV purchases could get up to $4,000. Recent updated guidance from the US Treasury Department, however, limited how many EVs would qualify for a subsidy.\n\nAnother issue is making sure people have somewhere to charge all these EVs while they\'re on the go. Currently, there are 130,000 public charging stations across the United States, with President Biden aiming to tackle demand by building another 500,000 by 2030. Part of this plan entails teaming with local officials to build them in widely accessible spaces, with regional governments needing to apply for funds by May 30th. If all goes well, no one would live farther than 50 miles from a charger. https://www.engadget.com/the-environmental-protection-agency-proposes-stricter-vehicle-emission-rules-123026451.html?src=rss"
"'Always Running' is more than cholo lit -- it's a manual for L.A.'s salvation For most of my life, I didn\'t think ""Always Running"" was meant for someone like me.\n\nLuis J. Rodriguez\'s account of his first 18 years -- from El Paso to Watts, Reseda to the Lomas barrio in South San Gabriel -- has long drawn praise and criticism for its unflinching look at Chicano gang culture during the 1960s and \'70s. Its descriptions of sex, violence and drug use continue to titillate teenage readers and draw bans from schools and libraries across the United States.\n\nWhen I finally paged through a copy some time after high school, I did it mostly to see if it was as ""real"" as friends made it out to be. It was. I never lived la vida loca, but Rodriguez\'s taut, melancholy sentences felt like the exploits of my cousins in East Los Angeles or the San Fernando Valley whenever one of them had rolled with the wrong crew yet again.\n\nThe 14 essential L.A. life stories, from Hollywood tell-alls to immigrant sagas, hard lives (Luis Rodriguez) and spectacular flameouts (Freeway Rick Ross).\n\nStill, ""Always Running"" didn\'t hit me on a personal level. I was a nerd, after all, from a blue-collar Latino neighborhood of single-family homes bordering the territory of one of Anaheim\'s biggest and oldest gangs. I felt only the ""bad"" kids -- the ones in danger of dropping out of high school, the homies cycling through the carceral system -- needed to read about Rodriguez\'s redemption. There was little of value for a ""good"" kid like me, or any adult.\n\nI rarely thought of Rodriguez\'s memoir in the decades that followed, even as I enjoyed his subsequent essays, poems, novels and speeches. I also found it impressive that a bestselling author like him did so much besides just write.\n\nHe and his wife, Trini, opened Tia Chucha\'s Centro Cultural in Sylmar in 2001. His many appearances, from universities to bookstores, public schools to prisons, made him my type of public intellectual. Even Rodriguez\'s quixotic forays into politics, twice running for California governor on the Green Party ticket, drew my respect -- if Norman Mailer and Upton Sinclair did it, why not a Chicano?\n\nYet the public always returns to ""Always Running,"" for better or worse. And it shows up perennially on best-of lists about L.A. and Latino literature. When it popped up on The Times\' ""Ultimate L.A. Bookshelf"" -- a popular favorite among survey writers -- I agreed to write an essay and decided to reread it.\n\nI expected to find a better-than-average young adult novel, and carved out a couple of days to finish it.\n\nI was done within half a day.\n\nAs a memoir of Los Angeles, it\'s a fascinating slice of regional history. The southeast L.A. of Rodriguez\'s time is a working-class white enclave. The San Gabriel Valley is still rural, and residents are mostly Chicano and white. You see in real time the rise of gangs, at first mostly a collection of neighborhood toughs instead of vassals of the Mexican Mafia.\n\nRodriguez wasn\'t going for an anthropological tract, though. He wrote an indictment, not a confessional -- and his target was one of L.A.\'s main civic religions: violence.\n\nIn advance of the 2023 L.A. Times Festival of Books, we surveyed 95 writers and culled 110 works into the Ultimate L.A. Bookshelf. Get ready for some surprises\n\nA young Rodriguez learned early on that whoever weathered it best and dished it back even worse were the victors. After a new gang began to terrorize his junior high, he wrote, ""All my school life until then had been poised against me: telling me what to be, what to say, how to say it … I wanted the power to hurt someone.""\n\nIt\'s a mantra that could\'ve been uttered by Harrison Gray Otis, Sammy Glick, Eazy-E or any other L.A. striver, real or fictional.\n\nViolence studs each page, but the gang fights, stabbings, rapes and shootings Rodriguez lists with escalating numbness aren\'t even the worst of it, nor the individuals who commit them. All interpersonal and individual violence, Rodriguez argues, derives from systemic violence that serves as the baptismal font for Los Angeles. It\'s the everyday racism Rodriguez endured from teachers and classmates alike. The marginalizing of working-class neighborhoods. The fact that his dad -- a former principal in Mexico -- can be no more than a janitor in the Valley in the United States. Redlining, discrimination, policing and pollution.\n\nAnd among the most ruthless actions is disinvestment. When there are no jobs or no education, communities and individuals enter cycles of violence from which few emerge. There\'s a brief description of the 1970 Chicano Moratorium, the East L.A. march against the Vietnam War that ended in violence, Rodriguez\'s arrest, and the death of three individuals, including pioneering Times columnist Ruben Salazar. But what hit harder in Rodriguez\'s memoir was when the youth community centers opened with grants during the Johnson administration turned into drug dens once the money dried up.\n\n""Always Running"" is the literary companion to Mike Davis\' ""City of Quartz,"" published three years earlier. But while we all rightfully hail Davis as a prophet, we usually sequester Rodriguez\'s insights to the genre of cholo lit.\n\nTo paraphrase Sinclair\'s bitter riposte about the success of his 1906 exposé of Chicago\'s slaughterhouses, ""The Jungle,"" Rodriguez aimed for L.A.\'s brain, and by accident he hit it in the heart.\n\nEven well-meaning fans do this. They\'ll cite Rodriguez\'s admission that he wrote ""Always Running"" as a warning to his son as proof that its intended audience was exclusively young men. But ""Always Running"" is hardly nihilistic or dour. While the gang violence in the book gets most of the attention, we need to finally listen to the salvation he offered to us all.\n\nLuis J. Rodriguez on his new book, \'From Our Land to Our Land\'; his experience as L.A. poet laureate, and the issues surrounding \'American Dirt\'\n\nThe most inspiring passages to my adult eyes are when mentors channel Rodriguez\'s teenage rage into community action -- walkouts, youth sports, protests, organizing. The story reaches a climax during a tense student assembly at Mark Keppel High in Alhambra, Rodriguez\'s alma mater. By then, he was trying to work within the system, on his own terms, which also meant trying to reach out to the white students who saw no reason to side with Chicanos for anything, let alone demands for ethnic studies and hiring of more Mexican American teachers.\n\n""This is not against whites,"" Luis said to his fellow students. ""It\'s against a system that keeps us all under its thumb. By screwing us, the school is screwing you.""\n\nRodriguez has preached this lesson to anyone who\'ll listen ever since.\n\nWhen I finished ""Always Running,"" I realized the memoir wasn\'t finished; Rodriguez\'s decades-long witness to the depths and heights of his life are its continuation. Authors tend to write memoirs to look back from the better place they now occupy. Rodriguez wrote it knowing he wasn\'t there just yet. He speaks now knowing we\'re not there just yet. But, like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. telling a Memphis, Tenn., audience on the last night of his life that he wasn\'t going to see the Promised Land, Rodriguez knows L.A. can get there, even if he doesn\'t.\n\nSo the work continues. Will we finally join him? https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-04-12/la-et-jc-essential-los-angeles-books-always-running-luis-j-rodriguez"
"The Intoxicating Hemp Derivatives Marketplace - Slow Train Coming In recent weeks, I attended the 9th Annual NoCo Hemp Expo at the famous Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, CO. It is always a pleasure to connect with old friends (and new) and so many legacy hemp industry leaders and business operators.\n\nIntoxicating Hemp Derivatives are very much here to stay. So much so that economists and market ... [ ] analysts are beginning to categorize cannabinoids as a third distinct sector of the broad and sweeping cannabis industry.\n\nI have attended NoCo since its inception in 2014 and am a big fan of the devoted following that Founder, Morris Beegle, brings together at his events. NoCo is one of the most unique trade shows in that, each year, it brings together the legitimate global who\'s who of the hemp industry. I am honored and proud to be amongst that group of friends. This year, I provided an Opening Keynote with a message of hope and unity. A brief snippet:\n\n""For the world to fully recognize the 50,000 uses of the hemp plant, we need to stand in unity and support for all uses of the plant. Detach yourself from your notion about what the hemp industry is supposed to be, and recognize and respect your fellow entrepreneurs, hustlers, and the like. Respect all uses in hemp\'s family of uses. All of them. You don\'t send one member of a family, because of controversy and disagreement, into the wilderness to die or jettison them, you must embrace them and work with them or you really do not have a family at all. For hemp to succeed as an industry, the entire family of uses MUST be recognized and respected.""     \n\nAll of the plant\'s uses and contrivances must be respected for the hemp family of uses to exist. This year\'s NoCo brought me down memory lane, as I recalled the various industry consumer product trends over the past nine NoCo Hemp Expos, like CBD, hemp flower, hemp cigarettes, CBG, THCa, etc.\n\nToday\'s market trend is Delta-8 THC and related compounds, such as Delta-10 THC, Delta-11 THC, HHC, and the like. Numerous states are actively promulgating regulations to ensure that these compounds are produced and sold in a manner that is safe and consumer friendly.\n\nThese products fall into a category that I generally describe as Intoxicating Hemp Derivatives (""IHDs""). One of one of the world\'s leading manufacturers in the IHD space is Colorado-based MC Nutraceuticals. Founder, Bret Worley, comments, ""Though we\'ve seen mounting pushback on hemp derived cannabinoids over the past year, consumers and marijuana companies continue to buy these products. The reality is that the hemp industry has fast tracked cannabis plant science by at least 20 years. This has allowed all cannabis companies and consumers to access new beneficial cannabinoids.""\n\nMake no mistake about it, IHDs are very much here to stay. So much so that economists and market analysts are beginning to categorize ""cannabinoids"" as a third distinct sector of the broad and sweeping cannabis industry. Leading cannabis industry Economist, Beau Whitney of Whitney Economics, and JD McCormick of the American Healthy Alternative Association, have gathered substantial data on three of the largest IHD states--Colorado, Virginia, and Florida. The numbers are staggering. The Colorado hemp-derived cannabinoid space:\n\n• Represents annual revenues in excess of $527 Million Dollars, with steady growth;\n\n• Utilizes over 24,000 acres of hemp biomass annually;\n\n• Creates material acquisition costs (biomass procurement) in excess of $171 Million Dollars annually;\n\n• Employs over 2,600 workers in Colorado;\n\n• These workers are paid in excess of $126 Million Dollars annually; and,\n\n• The manufacturing infrastructure in Colorado is worth far in excess of $205 Million Dollars.\n\nVirginia\'s total sales were estimated to be $1.2 billion, of which $562.2 million was derived from CBD and IHD sales in 2022. The industry employs approximately 4,263 workers, paying in excess of $161 million in annual wages.\n\nFlorida, oh my. Total sales in 2022 were estimated to be in excess of $10 billion, of which $6.9 billion was derived from CBD and IHD retail sales, while $4.1 billion came from manufacturing sales and $1.9 billion came from wholesale and distribution. The hemp industry supports the employment of approximately 104,000 Florida workers, paying in excess of $3.6 billion in annual wages.\n\nBased on the fact that nearly 85% of all U.S. hemp biomass is ultimately utilized in the production of IHDs, this industry sector appears to be an extremely beneficial family member as well. Worley adds, ""Consumer demand has risen exponentially. The types of consumers that we see are not choosing to walk away from marijuana dispensaries, but rather they are very discerning and elect not to shop at dispensaries. It is a unique consumer.""\n\nRecent judicial interpretations have indicated that these compounds, or many of them, squarely fall within the bounds of the 2018 Federal Farm Bill and are legal. With this eye-popping economic data from the real-time marketplace, the flow of investors and funds seeking to make major ""bets"" in the IHD space through my practice has increased exponentially. Hundreds of millions are being invested into the breakthrough crossover space. As trends tend to come and go, the presence of IHDs in the marketplace has undoubtedly disrupted the consumer product industry. It appears to be here to stay, but you ain\'t gonna learn what you don\'t want to know. https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthoban/2023/04/12/the-intoxicating-hemp-derivatives-marketplaceslow-train-coming/"

"Empower your Business with Robotic Process Automation Techniques and Beyond - Submit Guest Post on Big Data, Advanced Analytics, IOT, Data Migration, Data Visualization In past few years, business process automation vendors have been tasked by business verticals to challenges which caused these vendors to innovate around automation, integration with virtualization and ease of deployment & customization at challenging costs.\n\nThis improved the way these businesses cater to their customers, and thus raising the bar for time and cost to market. As a result of these changes, traditional businesses are seeking to transform too in order to not only stay alive but thrive.\n\nDisruptive technologies are causing increased and intelligent digital footprints for enterprises, enabling them innovative ways to impart value to customers. IPA (a set of RPA, BPM and AI tools) has emerged from the application boundaries of back office to facilitate enterprises convert into efficient and adaptive operating selves and deliver seamless experiences for customers and employees.\n\nTo embark upon RPA's journey, it is imperative to do the following:\n\nThe real power of this technology is that it is does not remain bounded by scope of desktop/UI automation. As it may bring some manpower arbitrage during the man to BoT conversion, but the savings will stop after process will not gain any other improvement which process re-engineering, integration and application of modern technologies like AI/ML/OCR/NLP will bring.\n\nThe key to solving process issues resides inside the processes, a detailed view, of business process always leads a better way to modernize and solve current challenges. This journey will endow the organization with Processes redesign and aligned workflows for customer's experience, digitization of data for personalization and analytics, and automation of non-value adding tasks to achieve jumps in productivity.\n\nThe following exhibit shows, how path to intelligent automation can lead to major discoveries of inefficiencies and future pain points. This process can be made iterative with appropriate scope selection. Several Process analysis tools can be used to gain more insight in the current process usage and based on the current business challenges, easily the improvement areas can be identified. Improvement areas which only would provide human arbitrage will lead to pure play RPA implementation. Whereas, other improvement areas will categorize into Form based BPM flows, Chatbot based interactions, AI driven decision making in flows. Some modernization and standardization can also be introduced by enabling integrations with appropriate systems for these flows. Analytics also play a major role in shaping these business processes as heat-map and time-motion analysis would depict.\n\nIn operations world, Intelligent Process Automation is viewed as do-it-all solution. CEOs are impressed by its impact on customer and employee; CFOs are impressed by RoIs; Line of business leads can view the clear delivered result; CIOs love the way the digital accelerator experience the enterprise is getting.\n\nOne ANZ Telecom leader, after adopting process automation across a portion of their enterprise (Supply Chain automation), assessed a benefit of $3.2 MN AUD is 18 months. A South African Telecom operator reaped benefit of around $60 MN USD after implementing automation in Group Tax and social media query space. A tier 1 Canadian Energy provider saved $5.1 MN USD by implementing automation in their SCM, Finance, Legal, HR, ITSM, GDS, TIS space. And the list goes on….\n\nAutomation tends to take away the repetitiveness of jobs and make them more human, making employees have bandwidth to explore ways of making the processes smarter with use of analytics and AI.\n\nFor an organization to be successful, digital transformation should consider appropriate talent and change management exercise to ensure skill gaps are addressed and employees understand and embrace the disruption. A leading health care provide in Australia has implemented automation to eliminate the L1 staff in their BPO, as a result the IP of the resources became more useful as L2 staff. They were in perfect position to learn more about solving the next level challenges\n\nDespite the view of obvious gains to business, many businesses are tip toeing towards reaching the automation scale, as they are either not sure of technology's long term returns or accuracy of their own complex and archaic business processes.\n\nIt is quite certain though that to have a competitive advantage, an organization striving on digital path must strive to make its processes automated across functions. https://www.dataflareup.com/empower-your-business-with-robotic-process-automation-techniques-and-beyond/"

"Creating a Stir: ChatGPT starts an exciting new conversation The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly and surpassed many human capabilities. AI-powered applications such as chatbots, natural language processing and machine learning (ML) have found applications in diverse sectors. While the roots of AI go back many years, of late there have been many rapid developments. The most recent, and notable, of these has been the introduction of a downloadable web application that acts as a chatbot for people searching for information. The unique search engine, launched on November 30, 2022 by OpenAI, is called ""ChatGPT"" or ""Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer"", the third iteration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3) platform.\n\nChatGPT leverages knowledge from various channels to compile general purpose aggregated data that the bot writes in a chosen style or format. For enterprises, ChatGPT is an avenue for teams to fulfil tasks using an ML service that can solve requests. However, the firm needs to review each request with accompanying content quality control. While the application follows the basic concept of a generic search engine, like that of Google or Bing, it has a unique interface wherein a user, instead of facing an endless list of possible solutions to a query, receives a simple, specific answer or solution from the algorithmic search engine. Moreover, ChatGPT\'s accessibility is accompanied by a vast database of knowledge, through which the application is able to solve some of the most complicated equations.\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT has further underscored the popularity of AI. As per data from the World of Statistics, the chatbot reached 100 million users within just two months of launch, beating popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Twitter. In the first month, ChatGPT notched up more than 57 million users. And in January 2023, as many as 13 million individual active users visited ChatGPT per day.\n\nAmong enterprises, General Motors is exploring uses for ChatGPT as a part of its broader collaboration with Microsoft Corporation. To speed up adoption through enterprises, OpenAI has forged a partnership with strategic consulting firm Bain & Company to integrate tools such as ChatGPT, image generator DALL·E and text-to-code programming model Codex into their Fortune 500 clients\' marketing, sales, customer service, software development and business operations. Bain & Company has also embedded OpenAI tools in many of its own internal processes. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is working with the OpenAI-Bain alliance to integrate ChatGPT and DALL·E into its content creation and brand experiences.\n\nIndia too is exploring ways to leverage the platform across various sectors. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is reportedly developing a WhatsApp chatbot for farmers powered by ChatGPT. MeitY\'s Bhashini team is testing the chatbot, which will help farmers learn about various government schemes. The chatbot supports 12 languages, including English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Odia and Assamese. Meanwhile, Velocity, an Indian financial technology company, has launched the country\'s first ChatGPT integrated chatbot called Lexi. According to Velocity, the integration of ChatGPT with Velocity Insights will help e-commerce giants by offering them AI-powered business solutions in a conversational manner. This will help them grow and free up critical business functions.\n\nPotential enterprise use cases\n\nChatGPT is a cutting-edge AI technology that offers a wealth of benefits for medium-sized businesses. Its advanced natural language processing capabilities allow it to respond to customer enquiries and requests with speed and accuracy, providing a seamless customer experience. With its ability to analyse large amounts of data, ChatGPT can also help businesses make data-driven decisions, improve operational efficiency, and increase productivity. Whether a business is looking to streamline its internal processes, generate leads, or create engaging content, ChatGPT has the tools to help achieve key company goals. By streamlining sales processes and providing personalised product recommendations, ChatGPT can help businesses and start-ups increase sales and revenue. Additionally, ChatGPT can assist in research and development by providing relevant information and insights to help teams develop new products, services and strategies.\n\nSome of the enterprise domains that can leverage ChatGPT are as follows…\n\nChatGPT has the potential to revolutionise the healthcare industry. It can be trained on large amounts of medical data and information, enabling virtual health assistants to provide accurate and relevant health information in response to patients\' questions and needs. The platform can assist in medical coding and billing by suggesting the most appropriate codes based on symptoms and medical history. It can also analyse large amounts of medical data, such as billing and coding data, to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for improvement. ChatGPT can also support behaviour change through personalised interventions. It can provide accurate, up-to-date information on prescriptions and over-the-counter medications, and highlight their side-effects, interactions and dosage.\n\nChatGPT can assist banks in detecting and preventing fraud by analysing vast amounts of transaction data and identifying suspicious patterns. This can help banks protect customers\' financial assets and reduce losses owing to fraud. Bank personnel can set up alerts so that security professionals get notified of suspicious activity. Additionally, the platform can assist banks in providing personalised wealth management services to their customers by analysing customer data and providing customised investment recommendations based on their individual financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\nThe platform can be used for quality management in manufacturing by analysing data from quality control inspections to identify patterns and potential issues. The model can also be trained on historical data to predict when quality issues are likely to occur, and can be used to generate reports and alerts to notify quality control personnel. In addition, ChatGPT can be used to generate automated test plans and reports to increase the efficiency of quality control inspections. Moreover, the platform can be used to generate automated documentation for compliance with regulations and industry standards. This can include generating standard operating procedures, work instructions and other documents to ensure that quality management processes are followed consistently.\n\nWith the growing demand for e-learning, ChatGPT has emerged as a powerful tool for generating content, answering student queries and grading assignments. It can handle a vast number of text-generating tasks, including writing essays, reports and summaries. The advanced capabilities of ChatGPT have been applied to develop several educational applications that have transformed the traditional learning experience for students. Several edtech companies in India have developed AI-powered chatbots that use ChatGPT to provide students with real-time feedback on their performance. Besides, with the ability to adapt to individual student needs and learning styles, ChatGPT can curate specific content that caters to the student\'s specific learning requirements.\n\nChallenges and outlook\n\nThere are concerns regarding the ways in which ChatGPT is accessing and producing this information along with the amount of personal information that the bot is accessing to bring the best possible outputs for a user. Given the prima facie fact of ChatGPT being an AI technology, it is probable that such usage of personal data is optimised to the best benefit of the company and may be more detrimental to the user than when the same is being shared by another non-AI company such as Meta Inc. ChatGPT\'s privacy policy specifies that the user\'s personal information may be used for ""conducting research"", which may either be internal or shared by third parties or even published or made generally available. This clause indicates a considerable increase in the ambit of public sharing of information.\n\nThese concerns notwithstanding, many individuals, given the popularity of the application, have been easily volunteering information to ChatGPT for various purposes, ranging from the need to get answers to testing the potential of the application. However, heavily regulated banks and investment houses such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank have all restricted employee access to ChatGPT.\n\nDespite the challenges, the launch of ChatGPT is a watershed moment in technological growth, with far-reaching and significant implications for society. The functions provided and promised by it are far greater than that by any other search engine developed so far. Meanwhile, OpenAI has begun the roll-out of GPT-4, a powerful AI model that succeeds the technology behind the popular ChatGPT. The latest update is expected to address the problems highlighted in previous versions. As the platform matures, it is poised to witness significant traction in terms of adoption across sectors. https://tele.net.in/creating-a-stir-chatgpt-starts-an-exciting-new-conversation/"

"Artificial intelligence can help blind people explore the world Artificial intelligence: Danish startup Be My Eyes is developing an app based on the Open AI model that acts as a virtual assistant for people with blindness.\n\nBe My Eyes has a mission: to help blind people explore the world around them using smartphone technology. Created in 2015, the app developed by the Danish startup of the same name connects blind users with a network of sighted volunteers who, through a video call, \'lend\' their eyes to observe and describe what they see through the device\'s camera. In the not-too-distant future, however, volunteers may no longer be needed. Be My Eyes is developing a beta version of the application that relies on a virtual assistant based on GPT-4, the latest version of Open AI\'s artificial intelligence model. GPT-4, unlike its predecessor GPT-3.5, is a multimodal system: as input, it can accept not only text but also images, the contents of which it can scan to contextualize them in response to a written command.\n\nThe function developed by Be My Eyes with this capability is called, without too much imagination, Virtual Volunteer. Instead of video-calling a live volunteer, users can send a picture to the AI-based virtual one, which then answers users\' questions about the picture\'s content. ""We have only recently had access [to GPT-4] but have already seen unparalleled performance compared to any existing image and object recognition system,"" said Michael Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes. ""The implications for global accessibility are profound. In the not too distant future, the blind and visually impaired community will use these tools not only for visual interpretation needs, but also to achieve a greater degree of independence in their own lives.""\n\nThe developers of Be My Eyes began testing the inclusion of GPT-4 in the app in early February. The results and the feedback from beta testers have been so positive that they have convinced the startup to speed up the release of the new function, which could be open to all users in the coming months. The virtual assistant will not replace humans but will be one of the options available in the application.\n\n""What sets the Virtual Volunteer tool apart from other image interpretation technologies available today is context, with a deeper level of understanding and conversational capabilities never before seen in the field of digital assistants,"" the startup explained in a post introducing the new feature. ""For example, if a user sends a picture of the inside of their fridge, the Virtual Volunteer will not only be able to correctly identify the contents, but also extrapolate and analyze what can be prepared with those ingredients. The tool can also offer a series of recipes and send a step-by-step guide on how to prepare them"". https://4imag.com/artificial-intelligence-can-help-blind-people-explore-the-world/"

"Hearing pushed back for Alaska book illustrator charged with posting transphobic notes threatening students Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA court hearing was pushed back until next week for an Alaska children\'s book illustrator charged with terroristic threatening after authorities said he posted around the capital city transphobic notes that referenced shooting children.\n\nMitchell Thomas Watley, 47, was scheduled for a preliminary hearing Tuesday, but Assistant District Attorney Rexene Finley asked that it be moved to April 21. She said she expected an indictment prior to that date. State District Court Judge Kirsten Swanson granted the request.\n\nWatley\'s attorney, Nick Polasky, declined comment to reporters. Watley spoke a few words in court, acknowledging that Swanson had pronounced his name correctly. Court records show his wife posted $10,000 bond in his case last week.\n\nPUBLISHER DROPS ALASKAN BOOK ILLUSTRATOR CHARGED WITH POSTING TRANSPHOBIC NOTES THREATENING STUDENTS\n\nWatley is accused of leaving business card-size notes at a grocery store, state office building and a Costco with an image of an assault rifle, the colors of the transgender flag and the text ""Feeling Cute Might Shoot Some Children,"" according to the complaint filed in the case.\n\nHe was arrested April 2, after several notes were found at a Costco and officers reviewed security footage that showed a man, later identified as Watley, leaving a note in the store, the complaint alleged.\n\nMitchell Thomas Watley, right, listens to his attorney Nick Polasky before a scheduled court hearing on April 11, 2023, in Juneau, Alaska. A hearing that was scheduled for Tuesday for Watley was pushed to April 21. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer)\n\nThe first notes were found March 31, the International Transgender Day of Visibility. That prompted the school district and law enforcement agencies to take heightened security measures, according to the complaint. Police have also said that prior to the reports, there were plans for an additional police presence at schools ""due to national rallies/attention to recent school violence incidents.""\n\n""Officers spoke to Mitchell, who said (in essence) that he was in fear of the recent transgender school shooter and took it upon himself to print out and distribute these leaflets,"" according to the complaint.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe notes appeared during a period of increasingly hostile rhetoric, amid legislative proposals and laws targeting transgender people across the country. They were found days after a school shooting in Nashville that left six dead. Social media accounts and other sources indicate the shooter identified as a man. Police have said the shooter ""was assigned female at birth"" but used male pronouns on a social media profile. Police have continued using female pronouns to describe the shooter.\n\nWatley is known for illustrating several children\'s books written by his wife, including ""I Would Tuck You In"" and ""You Are Home With Me."" Their publisher, Sasquatch Books, owned by Penguin Random House, last week said it has ended its publishing relationship with Watley and would discontinue selling their books. Several book sellers in Juneau also pulled Watley\'s works. https://www.foxnews.com/us/hearing-pushed-back-alaska-book-illustrator-charged-posting-transphobic-notes-threatening-students"

"Syria, Tunisia restore diplomatic ties after decade with appointment of new ambassador in Damascus Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nSyria will reopen its embassy in Tunisia after the North African country announced the appointment of a new ambassador to Damascus, Syrian state media reported Wednesday.\n\nTunisia has become the latest Arab state to reestablish diplomatic ties with Syria, after cutting off relations a decade ago.\n\nThe move by Tunisian President Kais Saied to appoint a new ambassador was immediately approved and reciprocated by the Syrian government, a joint statement from the two countries' foreign ministries read, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.\n\nUS REPORTS NO CASUALTIES AFTER ROCKET HITS BASE IN SYRIA\n\nThe announcement is the latest step in a regional trend of rapprochement with the war-torn country, which has picked up pace since the deadly Feb. 6 earthquake in Syria and Turkey and the Chinese-brokered reestablishment of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nBorder customs officials inspect a truck loaded with United Nations humanitarian aid for Syria following a devastating earthquake at the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey, on Feb. 10, 2023.

The breakdown in relations culminated with Syria being ousted from the Arab League. Tunis shut down its embassy in Damascus in 2012.\n\nEarlier this year, Assad visited Oman and the United Arab Emirates, two nations that had backed fighters trying to topple his government.

"Video shows a Russian YouTuber striking himself in the face with a Western anti-tank weapon after holding it the wrong way A video shows a Russian military YouTuber striking himself in the face with the recoil from a Western anti-tank weapon after holding it the wrong way.\n\nAlexey Smirnov, a former journalist, reviews, tests, and compares various weapons on his YouTube channel called Large Caliber Commotion.\n\nIn an episode, originally posted three months ago, Smirnov compares Soviet and Western anti-tank weapons, including the Swedish AT4. It is unclear where he got the Swedish weapon from.\n\nAt one point in the video, Smirnov attempts to shoot the shoulder-fired weapon at a tank, announcing: ""Here we have the ordinary AT4 ... let\'s see how it deals with a T72 tank.""\n\nThe vlogger goes on to explain the launcher works while fiddling with it, saying at one point that it doesn\'t feel ""very smooth.""\n\nAs he prepares to fire, Smirnov appears to not hold on to the front grip of the AT4, which is designed to help steady the weapon when being aimed.\n\nThe video then shows him pressing the trigger, causing the weapon to launch back into his face. He then falls backward, shouting: ""Ah, fuck … you bastard thing!""\n\nThe video cuts to Smirnov on his back holding his eye as a cameraman offers to help him up. A text then appears on the screen, reading: ""Thank you for understanding.""\n\nThe next shot shows Smirnov standing in front of the tank, a visible bruise forming around his eye.\n\n""Right, let\'s have a look before my eye swells up completely,"" he then says. ""This is why I keep saying that NATO provides shitty ammunition.""\n\n""You are telling me that as a shooter you are expected to have panda eyes every time you have a mission?"" he says, later adding: ""I\'m feeling a little nauseous, to be honest.""\n\nThe clip resurfaced on social media this week and drew immediate mockery, with some Twitter users commenting that the vlogger should have ""read the fucking manual.""\n\nIllia Ponomarkeno, a defense reporter for The Kyiv Independent, posted the clip alongside another video of American troops firing the launcher correctly -- by holding the front handle.\n\n""Russians,"" Ponomarkenko captioned the side-by-side.\n\nSmirnov goes by the name Krupnokalibernyy Perepolokh on YouTube. He started his military vlogs in 2020 and at the time of writing, has almost 1.5 million followers.\n\nAside from anti-tank weapons, Smirnov also reviews grenades, flamethrowers, and armored personnel carriers and tanks. https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-youtuber-strikes-himself-face-after-shooting-anti-tank-weapon-2023-4"
"Elon Musk says the 'constant attack' from the media about him being a 'horrible person' has been hurtful, but it's better than no free speech Elon Musk spoke about how media coverage of him had been ""rough"" and ""hurtful"" during a 90-minute interview with the BBC that was live-streamed on Tuesday night from Twitter\'s San Francisco office.\n\n""I\'ve been under constant attack,"" the billionaire said. ""It\'s not like I have a stone-cold heart or something. It\'s rough.""\n\n""If the media\'s firing non-stop stories about why you\'re a horrible person, it\'s hurtful,"" he added.\n\nMusk didn\'t refer to any specific reports, but his management style has come under scrutiny several times.\n\nHe has reportedly fired several Twitter employees who criticized him, including one who told Musk his popularity was sinking on the platform, and another who opposed his joke tweet about Donald Trump.\n\nHis cost-cutting measures that have seen over 6,000 Twitter staff lose their jobs in the last six months have also come under scrutiny.\n\nEmployees criticized the lack of communication involved, with one describing Musk as a ""brutalist decision-maker"" and another calling the company ""a bunch of cowards"" after he was fired via a now-deleted tweet.\n\nA top UN official also wrote to Musk urging him to ""ensure human rights are central to the management of Twitter"" after its human rights and ethical AI teams were laid off.\n\nAnd the reduced workforce has made the platform harder to keep online, with one ""massive"" outage happening because an employee accidentally deleted data and there was nobody left on the team responsible.\n\nMusk insisted that layoffs were necessary because Twitter was on track for an estimated negative cash flow of $3 billion this year – partly due to the loan he took out to purchase it – and he had to ""save Twitter from bankruptcy.""\n\nFor the workers who have kept their jobs at Twitter, other cost-cutting measures have had unexpected consequences on their working life. Insider\'s Kali Hays reported in January that some New York employees had complained of bad-smelling bathrooms with no toilet paper after Musk decided not to renegotiate the contracts of facilities maintenance workers who handle in-office supplies and cleaning.\n\nTuesday\'s interview also saw Musk clash with the BBC\'s technology correspondent, James Clayton, in a discussion about free speech and misinformation.\n\nClayton said he had seen more sexist and racist posts on his Twitter ""For You"" page since Musk\'s takeover. ""So you think if something is slightly sexist it should be banned?"" the CEO replied.\n\nAnd when Clayton didn\'t give a specific example of one such tweet, the billionaire became heated and said: ""You don\'t know what you\'re talking about.""\n\nBut Musk also spoke about having a ""love/hate relationship"" with the press, speaking to the importance of free speech and holding power to account.\n\n""The media is actually able to trash me on a regular basis, in the US and UK,"" he said. ""In a lot of other places, the media cannot say mean things to powerful people.""\n\nInsider contacted Twitter for comment.

"Warren Buffett slams banks for hiding their losses - and reveals he sold some bank stocks after spotting red flags Warren Buffett has finally weighed in on the banking fiasco. He slammed lenders for taking unnecessary risks and disguising their losses, and revealed that he sold his stakes in several banks because he spotted red flags in their financials.\n\nThe famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO told CNBC on Wednesday that several banks engaged in misleading accounting to artificially inflate their profits. He gave the example of banks valuing their long-dated bonds at their par value instead of their market value, which hid the fact their value had fallen on paper.\n\n""I don\'t like it when people get too focused on the earnings number and forget banking principles,"" Buffett said. ""Some of the dumb things that banks do periodically become uncovered during this period.""\n\nThe 92-year-old billionaire noted the banks that have run into trouble in recent weeks didn\'t make the same reckless errors they made in the lead up to the financial crisis. Instead, they mismanaged their assets and liabilities, which he described as an eternal temptation for banks that ""bites them in a big way.""\n\nBuffett also underscored the importance of people feeling their bank deposits are safe. ""It\'s important that banks retain the confidence of the public and they can lose it within seconds,"" he said.\n\nThe Berkshire chief said he sold certain bank stocks after seeing signs of trouble in their earnings. Buffett\'s company has pared or fully disposed of numberous financial stocks in recent years, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, PNC Financial, US Bancorp, and BNY Mellon. The investor emphasized that he didn\'t see problems at all of them.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank collapsed in a matter of days in March after it tried to shore up my finances by selling long-dated assets at a loss and trying to raise fresh capital.\n\nThe move spooked its customers, whose deposits in the bank were overwhelmingly uninsured, sparking a wave of withdrawals or ""bank run"" that spurred the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) to take control of the lender and guarantee all of its deposits.\n\nSVB, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank all folded within days in March, stoking concerns of further bank runs, fears of a credit crunch if banks pull back on lending, and a possible financial crisis. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-bank-stocks-accounting-banking-crisis-failures-svb-fdic-2023-4"
"Meet pocket-sized Pearl, the world's shortest dog Pearl is no ordinary handbag dog. She\'s so tiny, her owner can just slip her into her pocket.\n\nThe two-year-old chihuahua, who measures around the same length as a dollar bill, has been named the world\'s shortest dog by Guinness World Records.\n\nBorn in Florida on September 1 2020, Pearl is shorter than a Popsicle stick at just 3.59 inches tall. She is 5 inches long – around the same as a dollar bill – and weighs a tiny 1.22 pounds, a huge gain on the less than one ounce that she weighed at birth.\n\nPearl is related to previous record holder Miracle Milly, who measured 3.8 inches tall. She died in 2020, before Pearl was born. Pearl\'s mother is one of Milly\'s identical sisters, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nHer owner Vanesa Semler, who was also the owner of Miracle Milly, told Guinness World Records: ""We\'re blessed to have her. And to have this unique opportunity to break our own record and share with the world this amazing news.""\n\nPearl was recently unveiled on ""Lo Show Dei Record,"" Guinness\' TV talent show in Italy.\n\nAppearing alongside her at the studio in Milan, Semler said Pearl was ""a bit of a diva,"" though she seemed calm and unfazed in front of the live studio audience.\n\nSemler is the owner of three other dogs, all of whom are of ""normal"" size, she said.\n\nDescribing her pet as ""small like a ball"" and slightly taller than a teacup, Semler said Pearl is accustomed to a high quality diet of chicken and salmon.\n\nShe also loves ""dressing up nice,"" according to Semler. ""We have lots of fun together,"" she said, adding that her adult dog is still a ""child at heart.""\n\nPearl\'s record was confirmed after she was measured at the Crystal Creek Animal Hospital in Orlando, Florida, where she was born.\n\nAccording to Guinness\' official guidelines, each measurement was taken from the base of the front leg foot up to the top of the ridge between her shoulder blades in a straight vertical line.\n\nThe smallest ever dog, a dwarf Yorkshire terrier, stood at just 2.8 inches tall and measured just 3.75 inches long, from the tip of its nose to the end of its tail.

"Who says romance is dead? Couples are using ChatGPT to write their wedding vows When Elyse Nguyen was nearing her wedding date in February and still hadn\'t started writing her vows, a friend suggested she try a new source of inspiration: ChatGPT.\n\nThe AI chatbot, which was released publicly in late November, can generate compelling written responses to user prompts and offers the promise of helping people get over writer\'s block, whether it be for an essay, an email, or an emotional speech.\n\n""At first we inputted the prompt as a joke and the output was pretty cheesy with personal references to me and my husband,"" said Nguyen, a financial analyst at Qualcomm. ""But the essence of what vows should incorporate was there – our promises to each other and structure.""\n\nShe made edits, changed the prompts to add humor and details about her partner\'s interests, and added some personal touches. Nguyen ultimately ended up using a good portion of ChatGPT\'s suggestions and said her husband was on board with it.\n\n""It helped alleviate some stress because I had no prior experience with wedding vows nor did I know what should be included,"" Nguyen said. ""Plus, ChatGPT is a genius with alliteration, analogies and metaphors. Having something like, \'I promise to be your partner in life with the enthusiasm of a golfer\'s first hole in one\' in my back pocket was comical.""\n\nNearly five months after ChatGPT went viral and ignited a new AI arms race in Silicon Valley, more couples are looking to it for help with wedding planning, including writing vows and speeches, drafting religious marriage contracts, and setting up websites for the special day.\n\nEllen Le recently created some of her wedding website through a new Writer\'s Block Assistant tool on online wedding planning service Joy, which was one of the first third-party platforms to incorporate ChatGPT\'s technology. (Last month, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, opened up access to the chatbot, paving the way for it to be integrated into numerous apps and services.)\n\nLe, a product manager at a startup, said she used the feature to draft an ""about us"" page and write directions from San Francisco to her Napa Valley wedding. The Writer\'s Block Assistant tool helps users write vows, best man and maid of honor speeches, thank you cards and wedding website ""about us"" pages. It also lets users highlight personal stories and select the style or tone before pulling it into a speech.\n\n""I started drafting my vows and when I typed in how we met, it produced this very delightful story,"" Le said. ""Some of it was inaccurate, making up certain details, but it gave me a helping hand and something to react to, rather than just spending 10 hours thinking about how to get started.""\n\nLe said her fiance, who often uses ChatGPT for work, is considering using AI to help with his vows too.\n\nJoy co-founder and CEO Vishal Joshi, who studied artificial intelligence and electrical engineering at NIT Rourkela in India, said the company launched Writer\'s Block Assistant in March after it conducted an internal study that found most of its users were somewhat overwhelmed with getting started on writing vows and speeches, and wished they had help. He said the company has already seen thousands of submissions since launching the tool.\n\n""Almost two decades ago, AI enthusiasts like myself and my research peers had only dreamt of mass market adoption we are seeing today, and we know this is just the true beginning,"" Joshi said. ""Just like smartphones, if applied well, the positive impact of AI on our lives can far outshine the negatives. We\'re working on responsibly innovating using AI to advance the wedding and event industry as a whole.""\n\nChatGPT has sparked concerns in recent months about its potential to perpetuate biases, spread misinformation and upend certain livelihoods. Now, as it finds its way into marriage ceremonies, it could raise more nuanced questions about whether people risk losing something by injecting technology into what is supposed to be a deeply personal and, for many, spiritual moment in life.\n\nMichael Grinn, an anesthesiologist in Brooklyn, New York, was experimenting with ChatGPT when he asked it to produce a traditional Ketubah – a Jewish marriage contract – for his upcoming June wedding.\n\nGrinn and his fiance Kate Gardiner, the founder and CEO of a public relations firm, then requested it make some language changes around gender equality and intimacy. ""At the end, we both looked at each other and were like, we can\'t disagree with the result,"" he said.\n\nEditing took about an hour, but it still shaved hours off what otherwise could have been a lengthy process, he said. Still, Grinn plans to write his own vows. ""I want them to be less refined and something no one else helped me with.""\n\nHe does, however, plan to use ChatGPT for inspiration for officiating his best man\'s wedding. ""It mostly comes down to time because I\'ve been working so much,"" he said, ""and this is so efficient. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/chatgpt-wedding-vows/index.html"
"The top entry-level job for grads is telling Gen Z that college isn't worth it College admissions are plunging in the U.S., with anxiety over the debt burden a degree comes with-- coupled with a shift in attitudes toward career paths--leading many young people to question whether it's really worth pursuing higher education.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year--all while working from home Looking to make extra cash?

This can involve arranging and attending meetings with clients, sourcing leads on new customers, and producing regular sales reports, among other duties.\n\nHowever, for graduates looking to maximize their post-college earnings, the highest-paying job on Indeed's list offered double the average salary of an outside sales representative.\n\nEntry-level C   developers were being offered an average salary of $120,000 this year, according to Indeed's data, providing they had a degree.\n\nA C   developer is a software developer who specializes in the coding language of C  .

"Opinion: I'm betting on Cousin Greg. But I'm not a serious person This site is obliged, morally and otherwise, to warn its readers at the outset of spoilers in the forthcoming text for those who haven\'t yet watched the third episode of the fourth and final season of HBO\'s ""Succession.""\n\nBut that episode ran on (Easter) Sunday night. And in the intervening 48 hours or so, there\'s been a surplus of chatter about its contents to the point where it\'s hard to imagine anybody, even those who haven\'t seen it yet, not knowing about the Very Big Bomb it dropped: that Logan Roy (Brian Cox), the irascible, malign and misanthropic patriarch-founder-proprietor of the Waystar Royco media conglomerate and Succession\'s center-of-gravity, was stricken with a fatal heart attack in the commode of his company jet.\n\nBy now, we should be used to HBO\'s series pulling the rug out from beneath our expectations. They\'ve done it so often, especially on such media landmarks as ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Sopranos,"" that it\'s easy to presume they own the patent on making sharp, wide turns in the middle of their storylines. (Like CNN, HBO is a part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nStill, as more than one pundit observed of Logan\'s death, this one shocked more than merely surprised. From the very beginning of ""Succession,"" two resolutions -- successive, so to speak -- seemed inevitable.\n\nFirst, that the tightly-wound, perpetually ailing Logan would somehow die off, and second, that control of his Rupert Murdoch-esque business empire would then fall into the grasping hands of one of his four children, especially ill-starred, unstable Kendall (Jeremy Strong), impish, nihilistic Roman (Kieran Culkin) and icy, conflicted Siobahn a.k.a. ""Shiv"" (Sarah Snook). Now that the first development has happened, things already seem lined-up for at least six more episodes of nasty familial infighting.\n\nAlready there are wagers being made as to which Roy offspring will win what promises to be a mean, sloppy game of king-of-the-mountain with some betting that it will be none of the three, but someone along the periphery of the terrible trio\'s wrestling match who\'ll be Waystar\'s king.\n\nMore on this later, but first, one is compelled to address sentiments expressed in some circles that Logan will somehow be ""missed"" by Succession\'s avid spectators.\n\nNot me, though I do miss Brian Cox already because few actors anywhere are as adroit at playing dyspeptic sociopaths. He\'ll always be out-front in any stage or screen production in roles requiring ribald bombast and aggrieved dignity, applied with both delicacy and dynamism.\n\nBut I\'ve had more than enough of Logan\'s horse hockey. There likely were many viewers who got a perverse kick out of watching Logan\'s spiteful outbursts of bigotry, rough-hewn snobbery and casual cruelty leavened infrequently by interludes of physical vulnerability and genuine bemusement with his family\'s defects, most of which were his fault to begin with. Feel free to think of him as some crusty species of financial wizard. All I see is a mean old man who was more lucky than good, until that luck ran out. Period. Godspeed and good riddance.\n\nThe last thing ""Succession"" needed was more of Logan\'s mind-games -- especially with Waystar teetering on the edge of outright takeover, possibly even dismantling, by the flaky tech tycoon Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård).\n\nIf Matsson gets Waystar, whoever succeeds Logan will likely be more loser than winner. Which, given Kendall\'s dismal run of luck over the last three-and-a-third seasons, makes him the inevitable fall guy for Waystar\'s potentially depleted spoils. He wants to win more than anybody, but he can\'t get out of his own way.\n\nRoman, meanwhile, was always the most in thrall to the old man\'s resiliency and drive without having either quality in any abundance. All he has in his favor (and they\'re not much) are his dad\'s jaundiced world view and wicked lack of remorse. But he also is too impulsive, too bereft in reflection to be trusted with a grocery bill, much less a multi-billion-dollar enterprise.\n\nShiv is smarter than Roman and tougher than Kendall. But ultimately, she\'s neither as smart nor as tough as she wants, and needs, to be. In fact, while these three have become, by varying degrees, savvier about their respective situations, the last thing Logan said to all of them is the most perceptive assessment of them all: ""You\'re not serious people.""\n\nThis was also applied to Connor (Alan Ruck), eldest and least promising, or even consequential, of Logan\'s children. The news of Logan\'s death came as Connor was trying to raise the profile of his nascent, already faltering presidential bid with a splashy wedding on a yacht cruising New York Harbor. Connor\'s immediate, poignant reaction to his father\'s passing: ""He never even liked me."" The American people don\'t like him much either. But even if Connor doesn\'t get the company or the White House, he seems to have found happiness with a wife who may want him mostly for his money but is likewise happy with him.\n\nOf the relative outliers, Shiv\'s estranged husband Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen), who won Logan\'s favor last season for essentially betraying Shiv and the others, seems the best positioned to win the race to the top. But without Logan\'s presence, Tom\'s penchant for toadying and betrayal has nowhere to play off.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion\'s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor those of us with an overeager sense of the ridiculous: tall, ingratiating and hopelessly diffuse Cousin Greg (Nichols Braun) is the darkest of dark horses to somehow wind up on top of everybody else the way he\'s been in their midst from the start: as a haphazard, mystifying accident. It would be at the very least ironic if ""Greg the Egg,"" the minion\'s minion, stumbled into power as if he tripped on a sidewalk. It\'s so unlikely that it\'s… unlikely.\n\nI\'ll say no more on this except to suggest that you all try remember who in the end won that ""Game of Thrones."" It\'s not inevitable.

"The real risks banks face lie in central banks' rate-hike campaigns and geopolitical tensions, IIF boss warns Banks are facing a lot of risks right now -- but the biggest threat lies in central banks\' rate-hike campaigns and geopolitical tensions rather than in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, according to the CEO of the Institute of International Finance.\n\n""I think it is not a crisis. I think it was market turbulence,"" Tim Adams told CNBC on Tuesday, referring to the turmoil that rocked regional US banking stocks in March after the failures of SVB and Signature Bank. ""It was really just a few isolated, idiosyncratic institutions.\n\nThe vast majority of the thousands of banks in the US and across the world ""opened their doors in the past month and had no problems whatsoever,"" said Adams, whose organization represents financial institutions from around the world.\n\n""It has subsided, it has stabilized -- but we need to be vigilant and we need to watch for other stresses in the system.""\n\nThe IIF boss believes that a combination of rising borrowing costs and geopolitical tensions pose a greater threat to lenders than the recent turmoil, which he said was unlikely to lead to deep soul-searching for markets.\n\n""There are risks, there are geopolitical risks, which we can talk about. But the downside risks are real, and we just don\'t know how deep they are,"" he said.\n\n""The Fed\'s gonna probably tighten again. We have other central banks in Europe, in the UK, tightening. So there are risks to the downside.""\n\nSVB\'s collapse last month following a historic run on its deposits marked the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, with news of its failure sparking a rapid selloff in regional bank stocks.\n\n""I do think we need to better understand what went wrong in certain institutions like SVB. I think we do need to ask what happened to supervision, but I don\'t think we\'re gonna see regulatory changes,""Adams said.\n\nSVB held long-dated bonds that plunged in value because the lender had bought the assets at a time when interest rates were relatively low, before the Fed\'s aggressive monetary tightening campaign over the past year fueled a fixed-income sell-off.\n\nOther regional lenders like First Republic and Western Alliance have also seen their share prices tank since SVB\'s collapse as analysts assess what impact the Fed\'s rate hikes will have had on their balance sheets.\n\nAdams added that he\'s also worried about the global geopolitical situation – in particular, the deteriorating relationship between the US and China, and Russia\'s ongoing war in Ukraine. He believes these are graver threats to stability than the turbulence from high-profile collapses.\n\n""The US-China relations are pretty tense, and I worry are going to continue to deteriorate for political reasons on both sides which are self reinforcing,"" he said.

"Twitter confirms deadline for removing 'legacy' verified check marks If you want to keep your blue tick on Twitter, you'll have to hand over payment details in the next few days, according to Elon Musk.\n\nThe Twitter CEO has confirmed the final deadline for the company to remove 'legacy' blue ticks will be April 20 – just over a week away.\n\nIt's believed the date is a sly reference to cannabis, which is associated with the number 420 because of the time of the day it is traditionally smoked.\n\nMusk was famously filmed smoking the drug during a live webcast with comedian Joe Rogan back in 2018.\n\nHe tweeted the update and also confirmed the news in a 'hastily-arranged' bombshell interview with the BBC, in which he accused the interviewer of lying.\n\nMusk tweeted the new update on Tuesday evening in a brief message: 'Final date for removing legacy Blue checks is 4/20.'\n\nMusk tweeted on Tuesday evening: 'Final date for removing legacy Blue checks is 4/20.'\n\nThe blue tick on Twitter used to indicate an account that was notable or authentic - such as that of a celebrity or politician.\n\nBut Elon Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion in October, has changed this. Under his ownership, the blue tick means an account holder is paying for its subscription service Twitter Blue.\n\nCurrently, some users who were granted a blue tick before Musk's ownership still have it on their account.\n\nMusk refers to these as 'legacy' ticks - and he now says they will all be removed by April 20, 2023. The only way to keep the tick after then is to subscribe to Twitter Blue.\n\nTwitter previously said April 1 would be when 'legacy' checkmarks would start to be removed – although many remained after this date, causing confusion.\n\nOn Twitter, the blue checkmark at the end of an account holder's name used to indicate an account belonging to someone of public interest – such as a celebrity, politician or journalist.\n\nThe whole point of the blue checkmark was that it could verify a notable person's identity and distinguish him or her from an imposter.\n\nUnder Musk's ownership, however, the tick is now simply an indicator that an account is subscribed to Twitter Blue, the platform's subscription service that costs up to £11 per month in the UK.\n\nTwitter Blue gives subscribers access to several exclusive features such as custom app icons, the ability to undo a tweet immediately after posting it, and, for subscribers in certain countries, the ability to edit tweets.\n\nMeanwhile, some features that have long been available on the free version of Twitter – such as voting in polls and SMS two-factor authentication – are soon becoming or have become exclusive to Twitter Blue.\n\nIt's thought Musk – who purchased the social media network in October for $44 billion (£5 billion) – is trying to get Twitter's userbase to start shelling out a monthly charge to boost profits.\n\nApril 20 is believed to be a reference to cannabis, which is associated with the number 420 because of the time of the day it is traditionally smoked, and in turn the date 4/20 (April 20). Musk was famously filmed smoking the drug during a live webcast with comedian Joe Rogan back in 2018 (pictured)\n\nIn the UK, Twitter Blue costs £9.60 per month for desktop and £11 for iOS and Android and adds a blue tick next to a user's name, among other features\n\nMusk has also rolled out new gold and grey ticks to indicate verified businesses and government bodies, respectively, and is charging £1,000 per month for them.\n\nElon Musk sat down for an interview with the BBC's James Clayton at Twitter offices\n\nThe South African-born entrepreneur has just given his biggest interview since taking over Twitter, with the BBC at Twitter HQ in San Francisco on Wednesday.\n\nWhile discussing the subject of hate speech on Twitter, Musk accused BBC interviewer James Clayton of lying because he couldn't back up his claims.\n\nMusk also said Twitter had 'four months to live' if he didn't make changes and cut costs to save it from bankruptcy.\n\nThe billionaire owner confirmed that about 80 per cent of its staff have been axed since he took over at the helm – including Twitter's global communications team.\n\nAny emails sent to press@twitter.com now get a poop emoji in reply, while Musk seems to have taken over the role of comms himself by tweeting regular updates.\n\nTwitter has about 1,500 employees now, a sharp decline from 'just under 8,000 staff members' it had before he took it over in October.\n\nMusk also revealed his takeover had been painful and that he has felt 'under constant attack', but that financially the company is finally breaking even.\n\nAnd he revealed that he had taken to sleeping on a couch on the seventh-floor of the Twitter headquarters.\n\nAlso this week, Musk shut down the company that owned Twitter – Twitter Inc – and incorporated it into a company of his own, called X Corp.\n\nThe Twitter and Tesla boss appeared to allude to the news with a simple tweet containing the letter X.\n\nX Corp is set to become the parent company for all of Musk's endeavors, including SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and an upcoming platform that he's referred to as 'an 'everything app'.\n\nThis app could one day incorporate parts or all of Twitter, as well as online services and utilities such as ridesharing, food deliveries and more.\n\nOctober 27: Musk is officially made the new owner of Twitter, and tweets 'the bird is freed'.\n\nNovember 1: Musk confirms plans to change the system of 'Blue Tick' verification on Twitter, for a reduced subscription fee of $8 a month.\n\nNovember 4: Musk lays off half of Twitter's workforce as an alleged cost-cutting measure, claiming he had 'no choice'.\n\nNovember 9: Musk launches the 'Twitter Blue' subscription service which verifies accounts for a monthly fee.\n\nNovember 11: The Twitter Blue service is paused due to accounts purchasing verification and using it to impersonate brands and public figures.\n\nNovember 12: Musk fires 80 per cent of Twitter contractors without warning.\n\nNovember 15: Musk fires employees that posted negatively about him on the business messaging app Slack. The lawsuit between Musk and Twitter is dismissed.\n\nNovember 16: Twitter staff are told they need to sign a pledge to be able to stay on in their roles where they would be 'working long hours at high intensity' or receive three months of severance pay, resulting in a mass exodus.\n\nNovember 18: A news-ticker was projected onto Twitter HQ in San Francisco dubbing Musk as a 'space Karen', 'mediocre manchild' and 'bankruptcy baby'.\n\nNovember 23: A Twitter user reported that 5.4 million phone numbers and email addresses leaked on the dark web, before his account was suspended.\n\nNovember 26: Financial Times revealed that 50 of the platform's top 100 advertisers have paused their ads.\n\nNovember 29: Platformer reported that Twitter is in the process of reinstating around 62,000 banned accounts that each have more than 10,000 followers.\n\nDecember 12: Twitter Blue is re-launched with new Blue Tick reviewing process.\n\nJanuary 11: Twitter starts automatically redirecting users to the 'For You' tab - its algorithmic feed of tweets - every time they open the app.\n\nFebruary 8: Twitter expands the character limit to 4,000 for Twitter Blue subscribers in the US. Shortly after, the site encounters technical difficulties.\n\nFebruary 12: Musk orders staff to revamp Twitter's tweet promotion algorithm after his Super Bowl tweet didn't get enough impressions.\n\nFebruary 15: Twitter announces it will remove SMS two-factor authentication (2FA) from the free version of Twitter - a decision a security expert labelled 'absurd' that will lead to 'so many accounts hacked'.\n\nFebruary 25: Twitter reveals a fresh round of layoffs that brought its workforce down to under 2,000 - a sharp fall from the 7,500 employed when the billionaire first took over in October.\n\nMarch 28: Musk announces it will stop people from voting in Twitter polls or having their tweets appear in the For You tab if they do not pay for Twitter Blue.\n\nApril 11: Musk gives an interview with the BBC at Twitter's San Francisco HQ. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11964355/Twitter-confirms-deadline-removing-legacy-verified-check-marks.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"Google Updates Maps to Make Your National Park Visit Easier to Navigate     - CNET Summer is just around the corner, and that means many of you are planning a road trip to one of America's 63 national parks. The National Park Service recorded 312 million visits in 2022, an increase of 5% over the previous year, and while that's still a bit lower than pre-pandemic levels, figuring out how to make the most of your time in the wild can sometimes be -- well -- a bear.\n\nTo help make you the most of your outdoor adventure, Google is rolling out updates to Google Maps that are designed to help you get around the park a bit more easily and perhaps with more confidence about your enjoyment of the experience, addressing challenges such as identifying a trail that suits your group's ability or finding public restrooms close to your location.\n\nThe updates, which Google announced Tuesday in a company blog post, focus on four key areas of interest to many park visitors, including those must-do attractions, campgrounds, visitor centers and trailheads. The updates will include more details about the attractions, such as photos, videos and reviews from other visitors to help you decide whether it's worth adding to your itinerary.\n\nAnother helpful update will make it easier to decide whether a particular trail in the park meets your desires and skill levels. Maps will highlight the entire route of the trail, from where it begins to where it ends, and include photos and reviews from other users, along with information on how difficult it is and whether it's suited for walking, hiking or biking.\n\nGetting to the park and to the trails should be a bit easier with more precise directions, including highlighting park entrances on the map. And because cell service can often be sketchy in the wilderness, Google will offer a new way to download park maps for offline use.\n\nThe updates will come to iOS and Android users later this month, with updates for parks around the world planned in the coming months, Google said. https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-updates-maps-to-make-your-national-park-visit-easier-to-navigate/#ftag=CAD590a51e"

"Oil pipeline involved in 2021 Orange County spill will be restarted An underwater oil pipeline that ruptured off the coast of Huntington Beach in 2021 and sent thousands of gallons of crude gushing into the waters of Orange County is being put back into service, its operator said.\n\nHouston-based Amplify Energy Co. said Monday that federal regulators have approved restarting the 17.3-mile pipeline, which runs from an oil platform in federal waters off Huntington Beach to a processing plant in Long Beach.\n\nAmplify said it began refilling the pipeline last weekend, a process that will take about two weeks. The firm said the pipeline will operate under procedures approved by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which regulates the nation\'s 2.6-million-mile pipeline network.\n\nThe oil pipeline\'s return to operations marks the end to a ""very challenging last 18 months,"" Chief Executive Martyn Willsher said in a statement.\n\nThe San Pedro Bay pipeline sent at least 25,000 gallons of crude gushing the waters off Huntington Beach in October 2021, oiling birds and other wildlife and forcing a weeklong closure of beaches along the Orange County coast.\n\nThe cleanup from the spill was relatively quick. But the legal wrangling that followed was protracted, punctuated by a series of multimillion-dollar settlements over who was at fault: the company that owned and operated the pipeline, or the container ships accused of damaging the pipeline with their anchors during a bad winter storm nine months before the spill.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard investigators said the pipeline showed evidence of being dragged across the seafloor, with one portion bent like a bow. They said massive anchors striking or dragging the pipeline could have weakened the conduit by stripping away its concrete casing and making it more vulnerable to future damage.\n\nAttorneys for Amplify argued that movement data transmitted by the vessels showed them crossing over the pipeline repeatedly during a storm in January 2021. The shipping companies denied wrongdoing.\n\nAmplify last month said the shipping companies had agreed to pay it a $96.5-million settlement and said Monday it had received $85 million in net proceeds.\n\nThe shipping firms, which owned and operated the MSC Danit and Cosco Beijing container ships, also agreed to pay $45 million to settle lawsuits brought by Orange County residents and business owners, including operators of fisheries that were closed for more than a month.\n\nAmplify agreed to pay $50 million last fall to residents and business owners affected by the spill, including a Huntington Beach surf school, coastal property owners, a Seal Beach bait and tackle store, and several groups of fishing and seafood sales companies.\n\nThe Houston energy firm pleaded guilty last fall to federal environmental charges and agreed to pay nearly $13 million in fines and reimbursements connected to the spill. The firm also pleaded no contest to state charges and agreed to pay $4.9 million in fines and penalties. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-12/oil-pipeline-involved-in-2021-orange-county-spill-restarted"
"As the U.S. and China clash over Taiwan, Taiwanese Americans face an anxious new normal As a Taiwanese American, I\'m filled with anxiety and dread every time I see Taiwan in the headlines.\n\nIt\'s not just that the news is never good for the small island nation that China claims as its own territory, where most of my family still lives. It\'s also because the issue is so politically tortuous that even smart, well-intentioned people have trouble following the conflict\'s twists and turns, ongoing for more than half a century.\n\nMost recently, when Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met in Simi Valley last week, China responded with three days of large-scale military exercises that simulated a naval blockade of Taiwan, dubbed operation ""Joint Sword"" by Chinese officials.\n\nLast year, after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan and met with Tsai, China launched missiles over Taiwan and into the surrounding seas. They deployed warships and warplanes over the median line of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThese increasingly militaristic responses have had a chilling effect on discourse about Taiwan. Taiwanese Americans, and anyone who hopes to do business with companies affiliated with the Chinese government, are rarely willing to discuss it publicly.\n\nEven I struggle to form a coherent opinion on the issue, not least because all my relatives always seem to be fighting about it. In our family, the divide is generational -- my older relatives favor closer ties with China, and the younger ones voted for Tsai.\n\nBut I\'m wading in now because Taiwan won\'t be leaving the headlines for the foreseeable future. California often becomes the venue for these political dramas, with nearly half of all Taiwanese Americans in the U.S. residing in the state. And a military conflict between the U.S. and China will affect all of us.\n\nFor decades, a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan seemed an increasingly remote possibility given the importance of the growing economic ties between the U.S., China and Taiwan.\n\nBut now it is peaceful resolution that seems more unlikely, said Raymond Kuo, an Asia researcher for the Rand Institute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is more determined than ever to add reunification with Taiwan to his political legacy, hoping to unseat Mao Zedong as China\'s greatest leader. Chinese officials are pressuring nations and international bodies to cut ties with Taiwan.\n\n""They\'ve built it up into this political issue that they simply cannot let go,"" Kuo said.\n\nOne political party in Taiwan, the Kuomintang, or KMT, supports closer ties and eventual reunification for Taiwan. But popular sentiment in Taiwan rejects reunification with China, and the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party is gaining strength.\n\nAs the KMT\'s political futures decline, so do Chinese hopes for a peaceful reunification.\n\nThis creates a counterintuitive political situation in which loud, visible support for Taiwanese independence, and thus the DPP, might actually place Taiwan at greater risk for military invasion, given China\'s increasingly aggressive stance toward Taiwan.\n\nBut ignoring Taiwan might mean abandoning the island to the same fate as Hong Kong, where hopes for peaceful reunification and sovereignty were shattered by violent police crackdowns against protesters and free speech.\n\nCountries rarely go to war if they have strong and growing economic ties. But trade between the U.S. and China is declining, Kuo said. In Los Angeles, that means less investment in local development projects and a gutted tourism industry.\n\nIt\'s important to understand that Taiwan (along with the rest of the South China Sea) has become a proxy battleground for competing national ambitions in the U.S. and China, a kind of release valve for growing tensions. Chinese and U.S. political leaders face pressure at home to present strong stances on Taiwan.\n\nBut when leaders pay too much attention to public opinion, they rarely create good policy.\n\n""Taiwanese people are thinking, \'Yeah, it\'s nice to get support. But do they view us as a pawn against China, or do they care about Taiwan?\'"" Kuo said.\n\nThere\'s a difference between policies that actually help Taiwan and policies intended to make the United States or China look strong, Kuo said.\n\nCongress debated a bill last year called the Taiwan Policy Act, which laid out U.S. military and economic commitments to Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. The bill, Kuo said, didn\'t provide direct military aid to Taiwan, as the U.S. has done for Ukraine, but instead offered loans to purchase military equipment. And Taiwan is still waiting on weapons deliveries from the United States from orders placed in 2017.\n\nThe bill included a proposal that would rename the Taiwanese offices handling diplomatic relations in the U.S. -- currently called Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office -- to something that would give Taiwan diplomatic treatment more similar to a foreign nation, such as Taiwan Representative Office.\n\nThe change has not only a lot of symbolic value but also the potential to spark Chinese aggression and condemnation, which could put Taiwan at risk, Kuo said.\n\nOur representatives in Congress should know that the safety of the Taiwanese people is far more important than looking tough on China. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-12/taiwan-china-losa-ngeles"
"Violence dropped at California middle and high schools over 18 years, UCLA study finds  A UCLA study found steady and steep decreases in California school violence over 18 years, including fights and reports of guns and other weapons on campus, results that indicate students generally felt safe at school despite nationwide mass school shootings.\n\nThe report documented a 56% reduction in physical fights and a 70% reduction in reports of guns being carried onto school campuses while reports of other weapons, such as knives, fell by nearly 70%. Victimization reported by Black and Latino students, which includes instances of being bullied or assaulted, saw larger declines than victimization reported by white students.\n\nThe study by UCLA\'s Luskin School of Public Affairs analyzed data from 2001 through 2019 in the confidential California Healthy Kids Survey. Published late last month in the World Journal of Pediatrics, the survey took in 6.2 million seventh-, ninth- and 11th-graders from more than 3,200 public schools.\n\nClimate & Environment\n\nState officials have released preliminary floodoing forecast for the San Joaquin Valley and Tulare Lake Basin due to a historic snowpack.\n\n""These findings were evident in more than 95% of California schools, in every county, and not in wealthy suburban schools only,"" said Ron Avi Astor, a co-author of the study and professor of social welfare and education at the Luskin School and the UCLA School of Education and Information Studies.\n\nThe other co-authors were Rami Benbenishty of the Hebrew Univerity of Jerusalem and Universidad Andrés Bello in Santiago, Chile, and Ilan Roziner of the Sackler School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University.\n\nIn a statement, Astor said the study suggests that ""gun violence should be treated as a separate social and psychological phenomenon.""\n\n""Each school shooting is a devastating act that terrorizes the nation, and there is a growing sense in the public that little has changed in two decades to make schools safe,"" Astor said in the statement. ""But mass shootings are just one part of this story. Overall, on a day-to-day basis for most students, American schools are safer than they\'ve been for many decades.""\n\nHe attributed the widespread decreases in school violence to a variety of factors, including a focus on improving campus climate in the wake of the Columbine High School shooting and other campus shootings in the late 1990s.\n\n""[Billions] and billions of dollars, if you look at the state, national and local levels, have been invested in social-emotional programs ... and educating school staff on how to create more caring, welcoming settings,"" Astor said in an interview with The Times.\n\nActivists challenge L.A. Unified superintendent\'s support of school police, as well as school board members who reduced the police budget but did not disband the agency.\n\nAdditionally, there was an a massive influx of social workers, counselors, psychologists and other ""people personnel"" on campuses, Astor said.\n\n""If you look at where we were 20 years ago to now, in the [Los Angeles Unified School District], for example, there were a few, 100 maybe,"" Astor said, adding the numbers have substantially increased.\n\n""And you see that in district after district after district,"" Astor said.\n\nHowever, reports of discriminatory bullying held steady across the nearly two-decade study, Astor said.\n\nAnd although the study ended in 2019, other data havr shown an uptick in discriminatory bullying in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which leveled out this year, Astor said.\n\nHousing & Homelessness\n\nMobile home parks are among the most affordable places to live in California. But oversight has left many residents at risk of living in horrible conditions.\n\nThat corresponds with a recent survey of California high school principals who noted increases in incidents of discrimination against LGBTQ, Black and Latino students.\n\n""I think one of the reasons, in my mind, for that is we haven\'t really worked on [discriminatory bullying] until recently,"" Astor said. ""I think this is an area we need to work on.""\n\nAdditionally, the specter of school shootings still haunts the generally positive data.\n\n""I think there\'s a deep sense of disillusion that every time there\'s a shooting, there\'s almost a feeling that we invested all this time and energy and nothing works, that our schools are getting worse,"" Astor said.\n\nBut the data do not bear that out, with students themselves reporting that they are experiencing less day-to-day violence than before and feeling more connected and safer, Astor said.\n\n""They\'re also telling us in other surveys that they\'re afraid of dying,"" Astor said. ""We have to figure that out, even though it\'s complex. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-12/california-school-violence-drops-18-year-ucla-study-says"

"LAUSD pitched students an expensive experiment to get higher grades. Most turned it down Despite failing every class -- or because of it -- Rebbeca Avelino, a 14-year-old eighth grader, wanted time off from school during spring break. But history teacher Lorraine Escalante pressed her to attend two ""acceleration days"" in the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\n""She knew that I was doing bad,"" Rebbeca said. ""And she wanted to encourage me and she\'s like: \'You could do it. Don\'t let anybody stop you. You can do it. You can reach those goals if you try, and you should come.\'""\n\nRebbeca became part of an expensive, massive and controversial experiment in the nation\'s second-largest school system -- a key initiative, made possible by COVID-relief money, to fill gaps in student learning exacerbated by the pandemic. The money has to be spent by September 2024.\n\nLow participation ultimately limited the impact of the four ""acceleration days"" -- two over winter break and two over spring break -- as families opted for vacation time over class time. The relatively high-cost project had been envisioned as way of reaching all students-- especially the 58% below grade level in English Language Arts and 72% below grade level in math. Last week\'s spring break installment pulled in fewer than 8% or 33,076 of the district\'s 422,276 students for one or both days. During winter break, 36,486 students attended one or both days.\n\nImperfect planning and inexperience with the format also were impediments, although administrators tried to learn from the December experience. One example is that they focused harder in the spring on recruiting the students most in need.\n\nSome students who attended received individualized help; others did not. Many talked of fun activities, practicing basic skills, prepping for Advanced Placement tests or pulling up grades. Some teachers and students described a unique, calming and rewarding learning environment for those who did take part.\n\nThe cost of the days is difficult to discern because the district has declined to release detailed information that The Times first requested three months ago.\n\nIn a January presentation at a school board meeting -- a month after the first acceleration days -- officials said those two days cost $36 million. After public backlash over the costs, L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho announced that the actual cost was $11.6 million. The district, however, has declined to provide backup documentation to support the changed figures.\n\nThe costs at the participating 354 campuses included teaching and support staff, food services and student transportation.\n\nFrom the start, the acceleration days were a compromise, the surviving element of a failed try for a longer school year, which did not have widespread parent support and was opposed by the teachers union. Originally the optional days were scheduled for Wednesdays as an incentive for workers -- who would be paid extra -- and students to continue their weekday routine. The school year would have ended four days later. Officials hoped for almost universal participation.\n\nBut the teachers union filed a labor board complaint -- contending that the four optional days had to be a subject of negotiation. The district backed down, moving the days into winter and spring break.\n\nThe results of extended learning ""can hinge on whether the extra learning time is mandatory or voluntary for students,"" said Dan Goldhaber, who directs the Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research at American Institutes for Research. ""The most common form of extra time is summer school, and the research on summer school pretty clearly shows that a big problem is low attendance.""\n\nMany of the most effective tutoring efforts are provided during the regular school day, in coordination with a child\'s teacher, said Professor Susanna Loeb of Stanford\'s Graduate School of Education, an authority on tutoring.\n\nCarvalho has said this kind of tutoring also is ramping up.\n\nLos Angeles Unified Supt. Alberto M. Carvalho has a high-voltage style and ambitious agenda, although it\'s too soon to gauge his success as students struggle with pandemic setbacks.\n\nAcross the country, extended learning opportunities of any sort appeared to have been limited -- compared to the need.\n\n""We are seeing that not many kids have been getting the kind of help in the regular school day that would best help them catch up,"" said Robin Lake, director and professor of practice at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at Arizona State University. ""So the logical conclusion is that districts have to turn to out-of-school learning time. But that is tricky for the reasons you are seeing in L.A.: union contracts; teacher resistance to working longer hours; student resistance to staying longer hours, etc. And it is no guarantee that kids will learn more.""\n\nFor students anywhere, the standard playbook for academic recovery includes focused tutoring, extended instructional time and mental and emotional support. The program last week at Griffith STEAM Magnet Middle School in East L.A. tried to hit all those points and more.\n\nOne important element for successful academic support is small group size.\n\nThere were 11 students in Escalante\'s class on the second acceleration day -- compared with more than 150 over six periods in her typical schedule. Across the district, the ultra small class size was not entirely by design. More than 40% of those registered did not show up, according to L.A. Unified -- similar to what happened in December.\n\nAt Griffith, 385 students enrolled and 244 attended on the first day. Another 32 arrived without having registered -- for a total of 276. The second day total was 216, including five new arrivals who had not registered.\n\nAll 11 students in Escalante\'s Room 801 were students she teaches. She\'s had some for two years. Such familiarity is another feature of successful extended learning. Moreover, every student in Escalante\'s class was working online on individualized assignments provided by their various teachers that could be completed to raise grades.\n\nSuch individualization was not the case at all schools. This time -- like last time -- teachers reported last-minute additions of unfamiliar students to rosters as well as a shortage of up-to-date academic data. Many teachers provided general lessons that were appropriate for the grade level, but not designed to address a particular student\'s needs.\n\n""My elementary school had 64 of 194 students show up,"" said a teacher from an elementary school in Reseda. ""We had about 30 to 35 adults on campus for the students."" And while the adult-to-student ratio was remarkable -- and students took part in activities they enjoyed -- ""today did not help learning loss,"" the teacher said. ""It was work that everyone could do. Biggest waste of funds ever.""\n\nSome families reported even worse -- little learning, little that was enjoyable. But many parents and teachers felt just the opposite.\n\nA dozen community groups have signed onto mentoring effort, for which L.A. Unified will provide an organizing hub, including background checks of mentors.\n\nIn Escalante\'s class, seventh-grader Dylan Camacho, 13, pulled up his history grade from a D to an A while working online. He\'d done so by compiling information about Mayans and Aztecs. He\'d needed to recover from a disastrous group project, he said, where not everyone had turned in work, but all had received the same grade.\n\nStudents were not necessarily working in an area of Escalante\'s expertise. But she could direct them as needed to online, on-demand tutors available for live chat with an online whiteboard to write things out.\n\nSuch ""just in time"" tutoring can work well, experts say.\n\nFor many middle and high schoolers, the accelerations days were transactional: Do an assignment; get a grade boost. Experts have questioned how deep the learning goes in such situations.\n\nFollowing the December acceleration days, officials reported 7,812 improved grades after the traditional close of fall semester grading. About 220 high school grades jumped three or more levels -- from a D to an A or from an F to an A or B with the one or two days of attendance and work. However, it\'s unclear how much difference the acceleration days made when compared to past years, when there were smaller-scale, more-targeted special sessions during breaks, online credit recovery and credit for last-minute assignments accepted after the end of term. The district did not undertake that level of analysis.\n\n""I worry that pandemic relaxation in grading standards -- which may well have been appropriate -- has continued and is now a problem,"" Goldhaber said. ""In particular, I\'m worried that parents may not have a good sense of whether their kids are behind and need interventions, like extra learning time, because they see their kids getting good grades, even if those grades aren\'t all that representative of the state of learning/knowledge.""\n\nAs a break from the desk work, about one in five of the students at Griffith spent a portion of the second April acceleration day working in the school\'s garden, an activity led by Christine Mariano, the school\'s psychiatric social worker. Attending to social emotional well-being can be another aspect to successful academic recovery, according to experts.\n\nThe students seemed to know what to do without being told: attacking weeds in about 30 planters; gently prodding sunflower seeds into damp soil; watering produce beds brimming with chard, lettuce, cilantro, tomatoes and strawberry plants.\n\nSixth-grader Yarely Perez, 12, said pulling up weeds is hard, but ""really good for your mental health. Just looking at the garden just makes you feel like you\'re at peace.""\n\nAnother sixth-grade gardener, Briseida Aguilar, 12, said she\'d just be sitting at home, bored, if not at school. And she\'d pulled up her grades from Ds and Fs to mostly Bs.\n\nSeveral students spoke of being better able to focus on this quiet, simple school day than in the bustle of having seven 43-minute periods and having to keep up with assignments in all their classes.\n\n""It\'s much easier,"" said Rebbeca, who said she hoped to pull up her Fs to Bs and Cs. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-12/lausd-launches-two-more-controversial-acceleration-days-this-time-on-the-down-low"

They argue that the danger such public photos present to officers who have assumed aliases to infiltrate the underworld overrides calls for transparency.\n\nBut some critics dismiss the LAPD\'s claims as overblown and accuse the department of drumming up hysteria in the media as cover for its efforts to expand the definition of which officers\' identities should be kept from the public.\n\nThe photos\' release has raised fresh questions about just how much oversight there is of these undercover operations, given the LAPD\'s ""horrific history of spying"" on and keeping lengthy dossiers on politicians, activists and others, said longtime civil rights attorney Carol Sobel.\n\n""They had a Red Squad that infiltrated activist groups; the LAPD targeted the likes of Cesar Chavez [and former Mayor] Tom Bradley,"" said Sobel. ""To maintain their cover, undercover officers were known to have had sex with activists.""\n\nThe city released the images last fall in response to a public records request and related litigation by Knock LA journalist Ben Camacho. Camacho subsequently provided the images -- complete with officers\' names, ethnicity, rank, date of hire, division/bureau and serial numbers -- to the activist group Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, which published them online in mid-March.\n\nLAPD union sues the chief to prompt him to get undercover officer photos off the web, and wants the activist website Watching the Watchers taken down until the city determines which images should be excluded\n\nCamacho has posted communications with city officials prior to the photos\' release in which they said the disclosure did not include any undercover officers. But after the photos were published last month, LAPD Chief Michel Moore and other officials began to suggest in news interviews that the photos of some undercover officers were accidentally released and posed a safety risk.\n\nThe disclosure has spawned several legal challenges, the most recent of which came last week when city officials filed a lawsuit against Camacho and Stop LAPD Spying over the photos\' publication. The city\'s suit was roundly condemned by 1st Amendment and media rights experts who said it smacks of restrictions on free speech -- particularly since the city itself provided the images.\n\nAmid the unfolding controversy, LAPD officials have avoided the term ""undercover."" Moore has repeatedly used the phrase ""sensitive assignment"" -- a term that could encompass a broad variety of officers.\n\nIn a departmentwide email last week, Moore said he ordered an audit of officers in more sensitive roles whose personal information wouldn\'t be released in the future. Certain roles, he wrote, ""require this added level of anonymity to preserve officers\' safety and to ensure that investigations are not compromised if the identity of the employee as a police officer is revealed.""\n\n""As employees of this Department and dedicated guardians of the City of Los Angeles, you deserve to feel protected and supported by your employer. I recognize that many of you feel that the Department did not meet this expectation. Apologies only go so far, and words must be followed by action,"" Moore wrote.\n\nHe included a list of units and divisions whose officers\' photos would automatically be excluded from future public disclosures. Among them are: divisional narcotics enforcement details; vice units; gang enforcement details; the Gang and Narcotics Division; Major Crimes Division; Robbery-Homicide Division; Special Investigation Section; Special Operations Division; Crime Impact Team; Internet Crimes Against Children; all division or bureau-based surveillance teams; and officers who regularly serve on task forces.\n\nSuch exemptions could include officers working undercover only part time, Moore wrote.\n\nOthers who would be excluded from future public disclosures are officers who do online surveillance, work plainclothes details, conduct long-term investigations of violent offenders or networks, investigations that are of ""such extraordinary or unusual nature that it creates an unprecedented level of threat to your safety.""\n\nAlso excluded, Moore wrote, are ""any positions which require regular, repeated, or extended contact or exposure to violent criminal offenders, outside of the standard duties required of patrol officers"" and ""any position which would expose you to criminal offenders who have extensive financial and technological resources which could be used in retaliatory action against you or your family.""\n\nA review of a recent LAPD roster shows there are at least 307 officers combined in the Gang and Narcotics, Robbery-Homicide, Major Crimes and Special Operations divisions alone. It was not immediately clear how many more are assigned to the other ""sensitive"" units mentioned in Moore\'s email.\n\nAt Tuesday\'s meeting of the Los Angeles Police Commission, William Briggs, commission president, said he remained concerned about the disclosure and asked Moore what was being done to ensure officers\' safety. He asked the department to look into whether ""we can simply prohibit the release of certain identity information such as photographs because of the danger that it places department personnel in.""\n\nAfter the meeting, Moore said in a news briefing that ""to date, the vast majority of our operations, undercover operations included, have not been impacted by this.""\n\nBut, he added, ""we know that the potentiality is there.""\n\nSome longtime police observers said officials with the LAPD and Los Angeles Police Protective League have at times offered different definitions of what it means to be undercover officer.\n\n""It\'s anybody\'s guess,"" said Hamid Khan, of Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, a group that wants to abolish the Police Department and first published the photos on a website called, Watch the Watchers.\n\nIf anything, the department was using the controversy to be less transparent, Khan said, adding that this is particularly troubling given its history of surveillance of communities of color. Stop LAPD Spying tweeted Tuesday that the city appeared to be quietly deleting LAPD personnel rosters from its public data portal.\n\nKhan said he doubted the city\'s claims that officers\' lives were in danger because their photos were public. The site is only publishing information about officers that a judge ruled the public is entitled to -- and not private data such as officers\' addresses, he said.\n\n""Giving them the ability to retroactively redefine [undercover] is really dangerous,"" said attorney Shakeer Rahman of the city\'s lawsuit, which he called a clear attempt by officials to ""intimidate community groups that are critical of LAPD.""\n\n""One elected city attorney defines undercover in one way, and another comes in and says actually we\'re going to define it much more narrowly,"" said Rahman, who has represented both Camacho and Stop LAPD Spying in past legal actions against the city. ""If they\'re allowed to do that, that could really be ripe for abuse.""\n\nWithin the LAPD, officers who work in an undercover capacity generally fall into one of two tiers. Only about 50 or so officers are truly considered ""off the books,"" working on deep cover operations with outlaw biker gangs, terrorist groups or drug cartels. Their names are kept out of the department records and are known to only a handful of superiors. Most have changed their physical appearance and assumed fictitious identities, all the way down to a new driver\'s license. Some are based outside the state.\n\nChief Michel Moore, citing safety concerns, said the inspector general will investigate the disclosure of officers\' photos in an online database launched by the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition.\n\nDozens, if not hundreds, more officers work in varying degrees of anonymity on a part-time basis, from doing low-level drug buys to running surveillance on chronic violent offenders. The department also maintains a secretive cadre of investigators, known as the Special Operations Division, which keeps an eye on other cops suspected of misconduct.\n\nAccording to an LAPD training bulletin, undercover officers must submit detailed operational plans, outlining which department personnel and equipment will be involved and relevant information about the location, such as whether security bars or dogs are present.\n\nUndercover officers are instructed to immediately identify themselves ""and cooperate with any direction given by the uniformed officers and calmly explain the situation to the officers while continuing to follow instructions and commands.""\n\n""More importantly, personnel assigned to UC [undercover] or surveillance operations should avoid making any sudden movements, which includes reaching for police identification. Such movements could easily be mistaken for a threatening gesture,"" the bulletin says.\n\nA former LAPD supervisor, who because of the nature of the work could not be named, said there are at least three dozen officers and detectives who have worked in the most sensitive types of investigation involving counter-terrorism. Such investigators usually work with other agencies with higher levels of security clearance, the supervisor said.\n\nDan Murphy, a consultant with the Minnesota-based firm 360 Security Services, said that photos spread online could be ""potentially very dangerous to the lives and safeties"" of undercover officers, who often go to great lengths to build and maintain their covers. To be effective, they have to earn the trust of the people they\'re investigating -- knowing that any whiff of their true identities could put them at risk.\n\n""Underground criminal networks do a lot of work, they do a lot of background work, they make sure they know who they\'re dealing with if they\'re making money,"" Murphy said. ""There are many instances when [undercover officers] find themselves moving up the food chain in an organization, and they need to be covered in ways so that their identities can\'t be revealed with a five-minute online search.""\n\nAn undercover LAPD veteran who regularly deals with Mexican drug cartels said they now use counter-surveillance. The cartels get photos and video of takedowns by the Police Department and its federal partners and compare the images to booking photos of suspects to identify undercover operatives. The release of officers\' photos makes that effort much easier, he said.\n\n""This is the most serious compromise of undercover operations in decades,"" said the investigator and supervisor. ""We have had cartels come after specific detectives, but nothing like this that threatens so many of us. ... They can put faces to names and compare images to those released.""\n\nMurphy, a retired New York City Police Department detective sergeant who worked ""many"" undercover operations, said he recognizes that people don\'t want to live in a ""police state."" But, he thinks the push for ""full transparency"" around law enforcement ignores the fact that some investigations have to be carried out in secret to succeed.\n\nMost police departments today have safeguards against abuses, having learned from past scandals in which questionable tactics eventually came to light, he said.\n\n""If you make a criminal case, that all comes out in a courtroom,"" he said.\n\nLike most big-city departments, the LAPD has long maintained an intelligence-gathering wing.\n\nIn the 1980s, before Karen Bass became the L.A. mayor, she was part of a group of activists who -- with the American Civil Liberties Union -- sued then-Police Chief Daryl Gates and the LAPD for spying on them. In retaliation, Gates released information about Bass\' trips to Cuba and falsely asserted she had gone there to learn guerrilla warfare.\n\nUntil the program was shut down in the late 2010s, the department used to send undercover officers into schools to pose as students -- a program that was popularized in the ""21 Jump Street"" TV show and movies.\n\nBut officers who conduct surveillance aren\'t necessarily all undercover, said Sobel, the civil rights attorney.\n\n""They order officers into uniform for all these large protests,"" she said. ""When they put officers in uniform at protests, it exposes them as officers.""\n\nIn 2019, the department drew fire after it was revealed that the LAPD\'s Major Crimes Division sent an informant to secretly record the meetings of Refuse Fascism, an anti-Trump group. Civil rights advocates and other critics at the time blasted the department\'s tactics for needlessly infringing on the group\'s 1st Amendment rights, since it has rarely been linked to violence.\n\nAfter that scandal, the LAPD implemented a series of reforms to provide oversight of such operations in the future, including requiring the approval from senior officials such as the president of the Police Commission.\n\nBut it\'s exactly because of the department\'s unchecked surveillance over its history that sites such as Watch the Watchers are needed, said Khan, of Stop LAPD Spying.\n\n""For us, it\'s extremely, extremely concerning about how vast this surveillance, spying and infiltration apparatus is,"" he said. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-12/what-is-an-undercover-police-officer"

"A huge snowbank fell on her husband. A California woman's desperate fight to save him Melissa Cassem still cannot make sense of what happened to her family at their home in the Sierra Nevada during a recent heavy snowfall.\n\nIn late March, the Cassems were snowed in after a historic winter storm dropped 10 to 15 feet of snow in Alta, Calif., about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento. The family had moved to Placer County from the San Francisco Bay Area a year before. It was Melissa and husband Jason\'s dream home. They uprooted their lives and moved with their 9-year-old son, Geoffrey, and 11-year-old daughter, Juliana.\n\nOn March 29, a day after Melissa\'s 43rd birthday, a snowstorm made the roads to their home impassable and they did not have electricity.\n\nThe family home was running on a generator, and 43-year-old Jason Cassem noticed that the lights flickered. He wanted to make sure the power didn\'t go off while their children were getting ready for bed.\n\nHe stepped outside their front door to a nearby enclosure to top off the generator with gasoline, Melissa Cassem said. It was the last time she saw him alive.\n\nIt was pitch black outside in the rural mountain neighborhood, but she could still hear the running generator.\n\n""I figured, he must have filled it with gas, but something\'s not right,"" she said.\n\nShe went outside and saw that a snowbank fell off their roof and onto Jason and the small enclosure where the generator was housed. She didn\'t think twice and grabbed a snow shovel. She climbed to the top of the mound to try and dig him out.\n\n""He didn\'t answer when I started scooping,"" she said. ""Then all of a sudden it just caved in and I dropped down.""\n\nCassem estimates that she fell 15 feet from the top of the snow mound to the ground next to the generator enclosure, and there she found her unconscious husband, she said. They were trapped with the strong gasoline vapors in the snow pocket, and she tried to perform CPR on her husband. She started to feel lightheaded and tried to scramble out of the hole, but it was too high.\n\nThat\'s when she screamed for help, Cassem said.\n\nArmed with the flashlight on their mother\'s phone, the two children ran in the dark to the sound of screams. Even though they didn\'t have a cellphone signal, Juliana knew to use the SOS feature on the phone to make an emergency call. She connected to a Placer County emergency dispatcher who instructed the children to dig through the snow with pots and pans.\n\nThe roads were covered in several feet of snow, and firefighters were at least 90 minutes away, Cassem said.\n\nDesperately, Juliana tried to lower her legs into the hole to get her mother out.\n\n""She was convinced she could pull me out, but I already knew I wasn\'t even gonna let her try because she would fall in there with me,"" Cassem said.\n\nAround the same time in Missouri, Cassem\'s sister, Sara Marcantonio, received a frantic six-second video call from Melissa\'s phone but she couldn\'t make out who it was.\n\n""Someone in the dark was screaming, \'Help! Jason\'s not breathing,\'"" Marcantonio said. ""And then the call dropped.""\n\nBack at the snowed-in house, Geoffrey grabbed blankets and dropped them into the hole, because he thought his parents would be cold, Marcantonio said.\n\nThe snow continued to fall.\n\nThe Cassems\' house is near the home of Jake Platt, an engineer with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. When Platt got the call from an emergency dispatcher that night, his wife was 8½ months pregnant. Despite his pregnant wife at home, he raced to the Cassems\' home.\n\nOn a few occasions, Melissa Cassem had chatted with Platt on Facebook about the road conditions in the area. On that night, he found his way to her home and pulled her out of the hole.\n\n""I\'ve never actually met him in person, and then he showed up,"" Cassem said. ""I don\'t know how, but I had to jump just to catch him to try to get pulled out. He pulled me straight out.""\n\nPlatt was upset that he could not make it down to Jason, but he maintained his composure to praise Geoffrey and Juliana for their quick thinking, Cassem said.\n\n""For her to still be here is amazing,"" Marcantonio said of her sister. ""I mean, it\'s just a miracle.""\n\nAround 10 to 15 feet of snow was on the ground in Alta by the next day, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe Cassem family believes Jason died from carbon monoxide poisoning. His death is under investigation by the Placer County Sheriff\'s Department, but they declined to comment.\n\nMelissa Cassem plans to sell the family home, because they do not have life insurance and spent their life savings on their move. Friends are trying to raise funds through a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nShe\'s worried that she\'ll never see her husband\'s wedding ring again, because it was lost at the medical examiner\'s office.\n\n""I\'m still calling all around trying to figure out where it is,"" Cassem said. ""I\'m just continuing to pray that they find it. This is all hard enough.""\n\nMelissa met Jason in high school, but they didn\'t date until they were around 25, she said. He rode a motorcycle to their first date and for years saved a napkin from their first lunch in his wallet as a memento.\n\nThough he had a tough exterior, he was a sentimental romantic, Cassem said. He couldn\'t say no to his children when they went shopping, and he taught them to play the piano, guitar and drums, Marcantonio said.\n\nJason always rearranged his schedule as a heating, ventilation and air conditioning specialist so he could be with his children, and though it was difficult living at their home in Alta, Melissa said he tried to make it work for them.\n\nIn her career as a behavioral specialist, Cassem has advocated for children who experienced traumatic episodes.\n\nNow she and her children will need to process their own trauma.\n\nNeighbors and friends are staying at the Alta home while Cassem and her children stay with Marcantonio. She cannot stand the sight of snow, and the smell of gasoline or flickering lights triggers panic attacks.\n\nThroughout their relationship, Jason was Melissa\'s balance, she said. When she would come home from work stressed out and pace around their home, he would take her in his arms and play their favorite song, ""Shining Star"" by the Manhattans.\n\nHe was always prepared for what life had to throw at them, and tried to make his family feel safe, even on the night of the accident.\n\n""He was just trying to make sure that the kids didn\'t get scared that night,"" Cassem said. ""He was just looking out for us and protecting us. That\'s what he always did. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-12/a-huge-snowbank-fell-on-her-husband-a-california-womans-desperate-fight-to-save-him"

"American businesses under attack in Biden's bizarro world Inflation threatens the president\'s political and economic agenda.\n\nLet\'s do a thought experiment: try to imagine any major country in the world hosting a summit with American government officials focused on how Americans can fine, tax, sue or extort money from the country\'s crown jewel and largest companies.\n\nSounds pretty preposterous. Surely, you\'d think, no government would do something so harmful to its own companies or so advantageous to foreign competitors – especially not in partnership with another country.\n\nExcept, incredibly, that\'s exactly what\'s happening in the bizarro world of today\'s Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nPresident Biden speaks at the House Democratic Caucus issues conference In Baltimore. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nIn February, the Wall Street Journal reported that FTC officials are collaborating with European counterparts to foil U.S. health care company Illumina\'s acquisition of Grail, a startup focused on early cancer detection. Emails recovered through a U.S. Chamber of Commerce FOIA request show the FTC secretly coordinating with European officials to scuttle the deal.\n\nUS JOB GROWTH SLOWS IN MARCH AS ECONOMY ADDS 236,000 NEW POSITIONS\n\nIt\'s perhaps not surprising that the FTC is seeking foreign assistance, given its recent run of losses in American courts. In fact, this may represent another tactic in the FTC\'s playbook for discouraging and dissuading even those deals that meet legal muster.\n\nIt\'s no stretch of the imagination to believe the FTC wanted EU regulators to halt the Illumina deal because agency officials knew U.S. courts – which typically defer to the prevailing consumer welfare standard – would likely green light the acquisition. More, the FTC\'s secrecy about the Illumina case raises a deeply disturbing question: how often has the FTC skirted American laws by asking foreign counterparts to do the dirty work of stopping mergers?\n\nLina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), speaks during a House Appropriation Subcommittee hearing in Washington, D.C., on May 18, 2022.\n\nThe transatlantic alliance against U.S. business popped into public view again last week, when top EU regulator Margrethe Vestager tweeted a picture following a meeting with FTC Chair Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter, the Department of Justice (DOJ) assistant attorney general for antitrust, at a Brussels competition policy conference.\n\nIn the tweet, Vestager targeted a major U.S. company, noting that EU and U.S. regulars had ""similar concerns"" about the company\'s market share and competition issues. Did any European companies come under the microscope during that meeting? While there\'s no way to know for sure, I think it\'s unlikely.\n\nThe chummy photo op made it clear U.S. and EU regulators believe they are all on the same team. In most circumstances, collaboration with a close ally and partner would be something to applaud. But in this case, Khan, Kanter and Vestager all appear to be playing against the U.S., weakening American businesses to the benefit of foreign competitors.\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivers his State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 7, 2023. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOf course, this is not the administration\'s first foray into self-harming attacks on American companies.\n\nIn a January op-ed, President Biden called on congressional Democrats and Republicans to unite with him in an attack on leading U.S. tech firms. The proposal surely prompted some glee in China, which is midway through a multibillion-dollar campaign to help favored companies ""catch and surpass"" American tech leaders.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThankfully, Congress has largely declined President Biden\'s invitation. Instead, our leaders have embarked on a far more productive effort to bolster America\'s economic competitiveness. While hobbled by extraneous mandates, the Inflation Reduction Act will likely accomplish at least some of the administration\'s goals of boosting domestic manufacturing. At the same time, the bipartisan Select Committee on China has held thoughtful hearings on disincentivizing Chinese bad behavior and giving American companies the tools they need to win.\n\nUnfortunately, the FTC is moving in the opposite direction and undoing Congress\' pro-competitiveness efforts. When American government officials are working with foreign governments to harm our crown jewel companies, the system has gone off the tracks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCombined with the FTC\'s documented mismanagement and woeful string of judicial rebukes, the message is clear: it is time for Congress to step in. Congress can start by denying the FTC\'s proposed 400 percent budget increase, which would be a bizarre reward for management that has made morale plummet and top staffers flee.\n\nOnly robust legislative oversight can restore the FTC to its long-standing role as a bipartisan organization that provides clarity for U.S. businesses and protects the welfare of our consumers.

"Video: Swiss startup cracks the 1-kW ceiling for production of solar hydrogen Image above] SoHHytec\'s concentrated solar power system produces about half a kilogram of hydrogen in 8 hours, which amounts to a little over 2 kilowatts of equivalent output power. Credit: Gebert Rüf Stiftung, YouTube\n\nThe exploration of hydrogen as an alternative industrial fuel source is heating up.\n\nCompared to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen only creates water when combusted. That means it can play a significant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nYet as states vie for federal funding to set up hydrogen infrastructure, and companies start running hydrogen fuel mix tests, there are challenges that must be overcome for hydrogen to become a viable large-scale fuel source.\n\nThe development of refractory ceramics that can handle the higher heat release rate of hydrogen firing is one barrier to commercialization. Researchers are making great strides toward overcoming this obstacle. But production of hydrogen fuel is another challenge that presents a major hurdle.\n\nCurrently, most hydrogen is produced through steam reforming of natural gas. This ""grey"" hydrogen process emits about 9–11 kg of CO2 per kg of hydrogen production.\n\n""Green"" hydrogen can be produced through water electrolysis. This process emits no CO2 if renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, provide the electricity.\n\nHowever, producing hydrogen through water electrolysis is not yet financially viable due to challenges with scaling up the process. As such, in 2021, green hydrogen accounted for less than 0.1% of worldwide hydrogen production, according to a BCC Research report.\n\nSolar hydrogen company SoHHytec is working to overcome the scale-up challenge.\n\nSoHHytec is a Swiss-based startup that grew out of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). Their solution, which is based on almost a decade of research and development, uses concentrated solar power to improve the efficiency of green hydrogen production.\n\nIn their system, which is illustrated below, a 7-meter-wide parabolic solar dish covered with reflective mirrors concentrates solar radiation onto tandem multijunction III–V semiconductor solar cells. The electricity produced by the solar-cell module drives the water electrolysis process, which takes place through a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer.\n\nNot all of the concentrated solar energy is converted to electricity. Some of it is converted into waste heat, which is extracted using a heat exchanger. This heat can then be used for space heating or hot water in buildings.\n\nA pilot plant based on this system produced about half a kilogram of hydrogen in 8 hours, which amounts to a little over 2 kilowatts of equivalent output power. This much energy would allow a car to be driven for about 100 miles (160 kilometers).\n\nThis result is significant because it is the first time ""We have cracked the 1-kW ceiling for the production of solar hydrogen,"" says Sophia Haussener, EPFL professor of renewable energy science and engineering, in an IEEE Spectrum article.\n\nSoHHytec is now building a system with a larger, 9-meter-wide parabolic solar dish. The first demonstration project for the larger system, which is slated to be operational by the end of 2023, will be for a metalworking company that will use the hydrogen and heat for metal processing. Eventually, the SoHHytec researchers imagine that customers will be able to tie together multiple dishes, which will allow the system to be made as big or small as needed.\n\nYou can learn more about SoHHytec\'s system, which they call Arb, in the video below. https://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/ceramic-video/video-swiss-startup-cracks-the-1-kw-ceiling-for-production-of-solar-hydrogen"
"U.S. natural gas consumption reached multiyear lows this past January and February Mild winter temperatures and reduced natural gas consumption in the residential and commercial sectors drove down overall U.S. natural gas consumption this past January and February, according to our Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). In January 2023, U.S. natural gas consumption averaged 106.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), its lowest January volume since 2017. February 2023 natural gas consumption averaged 104.5 Bcf/d, its lowest February volume since 2018.\n\nU.S. natural gas consumption in January was 8% less than year-ago levels and 3% less than the five-year average (2018–22) for January. February natural gas consumption was 4% less than year-ago levels and 1% less than the five-year February average. Natural gas consumption in the residential and commercial sectors, which was down 16% in January and 12% in February from the same months in 2022, was low because above-average winter temperatures reduced seasonal heating demand.\n\nNatural gas accounts for 70% of space-heating fuel in the Midwest Census Region and 52% in the Northeast Census Region, according to our Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). In the Midwest, 20% less natural gas was consumed in the residential and commercial sectors during the first two months of 2023 compared with the first two months of 2022, and 16% less natural gas was consumed than the five-year average for the two months combined.\n\nSimilarly, in the Northeast, 23% less natural gas was consumed in the residential and commercial sectors during the first two months of 2023 compared with the same period in 2022, and 22% less natural gas was consumed than the five-year average for the two months combined.\n\nIn the West Census Region, temperature anomalies that influence heating demand affect natural gas consumption in the electric power sector more than in the residential and commercial sectors.

"Elon Musk Addresses the 'Painful' Side of Running Twitter Elon Musk gave one his most extensive interviews since promising a series of big changes to Twitter that he hopes will return the money-losing social media platform to profitability. In a wide-ranging discussion with the BBC that was also broadcast on Twitter, and was at times full of contradictions, regrets and dog jokes, Musk defended his management of the company and gave an update on layoffs, cash flow, the status of the blue checks and who might succeed him as C.E.O.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\nOn why he bought Twitter: Mr. Musk admitted that he went ahead with the $44 billion acquisition because he believed he would lose his legal case to try and back out of it. Buying Twitter has come with ""emotional strain,"" he added, saying running it had been ""painful."" But he said he still thought buying it was the right thing to do.\n\nOn profitability: Since buying Twitter six months ago, Mr. Musk has slashed staff and made big changes to the platform -- including an $8 monthly blue-check subscription -- to try to reverse losses. (The slimmed-down Twitter has experienced a series of outages and user unrest, but he largely blew off those problems as glitches.) Mr. Musk reiterated that Twitter was on a path to be cash-flow positive this quarter (without giving evidence) and claimed advertisers were returning to the platform.\n\nHead count: There are 1,500 Twitter staffers on payroll, down from ""just under 8,000"" when he took over, Mr. Musk said. He defended the mass layoffs, saying the company was four months from going bankrupt and ""drastic action"" was needed. But he added that it was ""not fun at all"" to fire people, and admitted that not everyone had been told in person: ""It\'s not possible to talk with that many people face to face. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/business/dealbook/elon-musk-addresses-the-painful-side-of-running-twitter.html"

"EY split: Project Everest plan to divide firm halted amid objections from US partners EY is a global professional services giant that generated $US45 billion ($68 billion) in revenue last financial year.\n\nThe failed plan was designed to free the firm\'s consultants from regulatory constraints around servicing current EY audit clients. In turn, the firm\'s auditors would have been able to freely pitch for work from clients that currently use EY consultants.\n\nThe FT quoted the internal memo as saying: ""The global executive remains committed to moving forward with creating two world-class organisations that further advance audit quality, independence and client choice.\n\n""However, we have been informed that the US executive committee has decided not to move forward with the design of Project Everest. Given the strategic importance of the US member firm to Project Everest, we are stopping work on the project.""\n\nEY could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nJust two weeks ago, US and global leaders said they were still working to resolve differences over key aspects of the deal including how to staff the audit practice and how to divide the tax practice.\n\nThe impasse pitted Julie Boland, chairwoman of EY US and who was picked to run the legacy audit practice, against Carmine Di Sibio, who chairs EY\'s global arm and was set to run the stand-alone consulting business.\n\nThorny logistics of divvying assets and legal liabilities plus shoring up pension payments also added to the challenge of separating the $US45 billion operation scattered across 75 different jurisdictions.\n\nRoughly 13,000 partners were originally expected to vote on the deal last autumn, but that timeline was pushed back several times. Millions of dollars in one-term payouts and the chance for an equity stake in any IPO those partners had been promised is now off the table. https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/ey-halts-plan-to-split-firm-20230412-p5czpj"
"House prices: RBA rate pause and migration end housing slump Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the recovery could be largely attributed to the Reserve Bank\'s decision to break the sequence of 10 consecutive cash rate increases with a monetary pause at the April policy meeting. The Reserve Bank kept the cash rate on hold at 3.6 per cent for the first time since it started its most aggressive tightening cycle in a generation.\n\nOut of 20 economists surveyed by The Australian Financial Review, six believe Australia\'s house prices have found a floor.\n\nMichael Blythe at PinPoint Macro Analytics noted that migration has gone from zero to 400,000 a year at the same time as a construction downturn. Approvals to build new homes have dived to their lowest in more than a decade.\n\n""It\'s a sad comment, but the rapid growth in residential construction costs has pushed a number of construction companies to the wall and experts expect more to come,"" he said. ""The practical upshot is less new housing supply.""\n\nMarket Economics\' Stephen Koukoulas, who also predicts the property slump is over, argued that the demand surge, from historically high levels of population growth, and a tepid new dwelling construction pace is outweighing the negative influences from interest rate settings.\n\nAdding to the improved prospects for the housing market is the expectation that the central bank has finished its tightening cycle. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will resume lifting the cash rate, but financial markets argue the job is done.\n\nBond traders only imply a one-in-four chance the Reserve Bank will lift the cash rate to 3.85 per cent in May, and predict a rate cut by early next year, reducing the cash rate to 3.1 per cent by mid-2024.\n\n""Lower rates are always a good way to get the housing market going,"" said Mr Blythe. He anticipates first-time home buyers to dip into the market, particularly so for those who think that not only rates have peaked but cuts are also on the cards. ""[They may think that] now is a good time to get in, the fear of missing out is alive,"" he said.\n\nThe hot rental market is a major reason for renters and investors to buy homes, with expectations demand will push prices higher. Rental rates have surged – with 57 suburbs up more than 20 per cent in just a year – and vacancies hit a new low of 0.9 per cent across the combined capital cities during February.\n\nRBC Capital Markets revised its peak-to-trough house price fall to 9 per cent, from 16 per cent previously, on Tuesday. ""Nationwide house prices in Australia appear likely to trough in the second quarter of the year, around one quarter earlier than we had expected,"" said RBC Capital Markets chief economist for Australia Su-Lin Ong.\n\nMany economists, however, believe the property market slump has more room to run, as the full impact of higher interest rates flows through to mortgages, unemployment rises, and the economy slows.\n\n""Historically house prices have tended to trough six to 12 months after interest rates peak, so even if rates remain on hold, which is our expectation, then the bottom of the housing market is still ahead of us,"" said Alexis Gray, a senior economist at Vanguard.\n\nThe looming shift of $400 billion of fixed-rate mortgages to variable rates is a key reason UBS predicts home prices will fall further.\n\n""The accelerating expiry for fixed-rate mortgages, from 2 per cent [in interest rates] to 6 per cent amid rising unemployment to 4.5 per cent in the year ahead will see some stressed selling,"" said Nic Guesnon, an economist at UBS. He now anticipates a peak-to-trough decline of 15 per cent, from 17 per cent previously.\n\nAMP predicts the current bounce in home prices will be shortlived. Demand from bargain hunters will run its course and distressed selling will happen as economic conditions deteriorate. ""We continue to see average home prices resuming their falls later this year,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP.\n\nGoldman Sachs argues the RBA\'s monetary pause is likely to prematurely loosen financial conditions and generate a counter-productive boost to growth and inflation in the second half of the year.\n\n""To prevent this from occurring, the RBA will need to hike to put downward pressure on house prices and keep the impulse to GDP growth negative,"" said Andrew Boak, chief economist for Australia at Goldman. He forecasts house prices to be 11 per cent below their cyclical peak by Christmas.\n\nJudo Bank economic adviser Warren Hogan is among the most pessimistic, predicting a decline between 18 per cent and 20 per cent. He declares the current period of stabilisation temporary before prices start falling again in the second half.\n\n""The next phase of price declines will be triggered by rising real interest rates, a weaker labour market and tighter credit conditions in 2024,"" he said. https://www.afr.com/markets/debt-markets/rba-rate-pause-fuels-speculation-housing-slump-over-20230411-p5czim"

"Remote ID Compliance and your DJI Enterprise Drones – sUAS News – The Business of Drones We\'re already into April and less than half a year from the September 16 compliance date for drone operators to meet the FAA\'s Remote ID rules. There are a lot of questions about the upcoming rollout of Remote ID, so we\'ve prepared some answers, specifically in relation to DJI\'s Enterprise line of drones.\n\nTo start, for those who are unfamiliar: Remote ID (RID) is a system that enables a drone to provide identification and location information that can be received by other parties. The system can be compared to an electronic license plate for drones that sends license plate information via radio signals to ground-based receivers.\n\nSince 2016, the U.S. government has prioritized the development of Remote ID to limit the areas where drones fly without a way to identify their pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has collaborated with various stakeholders across the drone world to find potential solutions to this scenario. In late 2019, the FAA proposed initial rules, which were later revised in response to over 53,000 comments from interested parties, including drone pilots, law enforcement organizations, and drone industry groups. The final rules for RID reflect substantial input from these stakeholders.\n\nAll drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds must transmit a signal containing their serial number, position, and altitude. The drone\'s serial number will be connected to the owner\'s registration data in the FAA\'s database. Therefore, the Remote ID function will not broadcast any personal information. Instead, authorized officials will be able to access the owner\'s information by using the serial number, similar to the process of checking vehicle registration information using a license plate number.\n\nTo transmit this information, the new rules specify the use of a radio protocol that can be picked up by handheld receivers such as smartphones or tablets. The latest DJI drones, through a firmware update, will be capable of transmitting the required information. For older drones and homemade models without this feature, an add-on module can be utilized to send Remote ID information.\n\nIn the future, all new DJI Enterprise drones will be built to be Remote ID compliant.\n\nIf your DJI Enterprise drone was introduced to the market after September 2022, it is already designed to comply with Remote ID. This includes the Mavic 3 Enterprise Series, Mavic 3E, Mavic 3T, and Mavic 3M.\n\nFor our other current flagship models, the Matrice 300 RTK and the Matrice 30 Series, we have already rolled out a firmware update that makes these two platforms compliant with Remote ID standards. If you bought the drone recently and it was made after September 2022, it may already be RID-compliant. Read in the next section to learn how to check if it\'s already RID-compliant or not.\n\nFor last-generation drones, the P4 RTK and the Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced, we will also release a firmware version to make them Remote ID compliant. If you\'re not already subscribed to our newsletter, be sure to fill out the form at the bottom of the page so you\'ll be notified when the firmware update is available.\n\nLegacy drones, namely the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual, Mavic 2 Enterprise Zoom, the Matrice 200 Series, can be made RID-compatible through a Remote ID broadcast module that can transmit the required radio signals. While DJI is not selling a RID broadcast module, there are numerous 3rd party options available.\n\nHere\'s a visual breakdown of the Remote ID compliance of our Enterprise drones:\n\nBefore the September 16 start date, there are a few steps you can take to ensure you\'re ready for Remote ID.\n\nFor the Matrice 30 Series, firmware versions v05.01.00.00 and newer are RID compliant.\n\nFor the Matrice 300 RTK, firmware versions v05.01.01.00 onwards are RID compliant.\n\nFor your drone to be RID-compliant, its Certificate of Aircraft Registration must include the Remote ID serial number of the drone. To do this, you must provide the following information to the Registry:\n\nThis information can be provided through the FAA\'s DroneZone portal. For step-by-step instructions on how to find your drone\'s serial number and how to add it to the FAA\'s Registry, you can follow this guide.\n\nStarting in September 2022, DJI has produced drones that meet the requirements for Remote ID, including affixing RID-compliant labels to the drone before leaving the factory. Check your drone for the RID-compliance identifier ""ASTM F3411-22a-RID-B"" on the compliance label.\n\nFor earlier drones upgraded with RID-compliant firmware, you can contact DJI Support for how to label your drone.\n\nThere are multiple ways to check if Remote ID is working properly.\n\nDJI drones automatically initiate a pre-flight self-test (PFST) of the Remote ID system before takeoff, and cannot take off if they don\'t pass the PFST. The results of the PFST of the Remote ID system, i.e. the working status, can be viewed in the DJI flight control app.\n\nIn DJI Pilot 2, if Remote ID is working properly, the RID icon in the upper left corner of the DJI Pilot 2 homepage will be displayed in black, and DJI Pilot 2 will display ""Normal"" on the Camera View, as shown in the Figure below.\n\nIf Remote ID is working abnormally, the RID icon in the upper left corner of the DJI Pilot 2 homepage will be displayed in red, and DJI Pilot 2 will display ""Remote ID module error"" on the Camera View, as shown in the Figure below.\n\nAlternatively, you can check local WLAN networks to see if your Remote ID serial number is being broadcasted. Use the DJI remote controller to start the drone\'s motors and then check WLAN networks.\n\nIf you can see a string prefixed with ""RID-"" followed by a 20-digit alphanumeric Remote ID serial number in the ""Available networks"", it means that the Remote ID is broadcast properly.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Remote ID and DJI\'s plans, you can refer to the FAA Remote ID Compliance Use Guide-FAQ on the DJI Forum.\n\nThe upcoming rollout of Remote ID rules by the FAA is just months away, and there are still many questions surrounding this new system.

"NYPD reboots cyborg police dog after backlash and, again, civil rights advocates warn against high-tech hound NEW YORK -- Digidog, the NYPD robot pooch, is back and department leaders promise it\'s not the dystopian surveillance nightmare it was made out to be the first time New Yorkers got a look at it.\n\nTwo years after the $74,000 robot canine program landed the NYPD in the doghouse with civil rights advocates, Digidog, also known as Spot, got a new leash on life Tuesday as the city announced it was bringing it back.\n\nPolice Commissioner Keechant Sewell noted the NYPD\'s long history with technology -- the first police force to put in place a 911 call system and among the first to use fingerprints and mugshots -- said New Yorkers will be kept abreast of how the cyber mutt and two other tech tools that are part of pilot programs will be used.\n\n""We want the public to know that the use of these technologies will be transparent, consistent and always done in collaboration with the people that we serve,"" Sewell said.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, meanwhile, was more critical, noting that the previous administration let objections to Digidog win the day.\n\n""That is not how I operate,"" he said. ""I operate on whatever is best for the city. Digidog is out of the pound.\n\n""Digidog is now part of the tool kit we are using.""\n\nNYPD critics were not amused.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society said there hasn\'t been any meaningful dialogue with communities ""about whether this is how we want to live.""\n\n""The Legal Aid Society urges the City Council to hold an immediate oversight hearing to further investigate the use of these technologies and to afford all New Yorkers the chance to have their voices heard.""\n\nCouncil Speaker Adrienne Adams questioned spending money on robots at a time when social service agencies are having their budgets cut.\n\nThe Speaker also said the council will investigate whether the NYPD has run afoul of the restrictions in place following the 2020 enactment of the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act.\n\nDigidog\'s use sparked a fierce backlash in 2021, first when it appeared on social media as part of a response to a Bronx home invasion, then when it was used at a Manhattan housing project, with some residents and advocates calling it a symbol of how aggressive police had become in minority neighborhoods. Some said it resembled robots from the TV show ""Black Mirror.""\n\nThe NYPD insisted the 70-pound robot, which can run 3.5 miles per hour and climb stairs equipped with cameras, lights and a two-way communications system, would improve officer safety because it could be used to scope out dangerous situations, such as one involving a barricaded gunman.\n\nBut its fate was sealed when then-Comptroller Scott Stringer said the robot was acquired without properly notifying the city, something the NYPD said it wasn\'t required to do because Digidog could be used at scenes involving terrorist bombers, making its lease confidential.\n\n""I think we have better things to worry about,"" then-Commissioner Dermot Shea later said in response to the e-canine saga. Less than a month later, the high-tech hound was sent back to its manufacturer, Boston Dynamics.\n\nSewell Tuesday also announced two new tech tools that will be part of pilot programs.\n\nOne, made by Starchase, allows police to fire at a fleeing vehicle with a GPS device that can stick to the license plate or trunk, eliminating the need for a high-speed chase.\n\nThe second is a 400-pound robot that looks like something out of ""Star Wars"" and will patrol Times Square this summer, either on the street or in the subway station. Crime victims, for instance, can make use of the robot, speaking to it, with the message relayed to police in real-time.\n\nStarChase Technology, makers of what it calls ""high-speed pursuit alternatives,"" says 10,000 tags have been successfully deployed by various law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe tags are fired from either a ""GPS launcher"" that looks like an assault rifle -- though its yellow body is a clear indication it is something other than a firearm -- and are affixed to the vehicle driven by the suspect.\n\nThe robot -- a police source likened it to R2D2 -- is manufactured by Knightscope, whose website notes the need for ""superhuman abilities to fight crime.""\n\nThe cost for either pilot was not immediately clear though a police source said the robot would be rented by the hour.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the new devices will be received by the public.\n\nAlbert Fox Cahn, head of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), said New York needs real safety measures, not \'Robocop\' knockoffs.\n\n""How many more millions do we have to waste on biased, broken, and downright creepy technology before we realize it won\'t work?"" Kahn said. ""We should be investing in actual human beings, not robots.""\n\n(Daily News staff writer Chris Sommerfeldt contributed to this story.) https://news.yahoo.com/nypd-reboots-cyborg-police-dog-215400176.html"
"GA-ASI Flies MQ-20 Avenger Autonomously Using LEO SATCOM Datalink – sUAS News – The Business of Drones On April 6, 2023, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) conducted live, tactical, air combat manoeuvres using Artificial Intelligence (AI) pilots to control a company-owned MQ-20 Avenger  Unmanned Aircraft System. Collaborative manoeuvres between human and AI pilots were conducted using GA-ASI\'s Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) ecosystem over a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) provider\'s IP-based Mission Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) datalink. The LEO SATCOM connection was also used to rapidly retrain and redeploy AI pilots while the aircraft was airborne, demonstrating GA-ASI\'s ability to update AI pilots within minutes.\n\nThis marks the first deployment of a LEO SATCOM provider connection running on an operationally relevant unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) platform. The team used two L3Harris Technologies RASOR Multi-Functional Processors (MFPs) – one that housed the transceiver card and another that controlled the BLOS Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA). The test aircraft was outfitted with a Ball Aerospace BLOS AESA system, capable of full duplex operation. The demonstration highlighted GA-ASI\'s commitment to operationalizing CCA by fusing innovative future warfare technologies, such as GA-ASI\'s AI pilots and LVC ecosystem, and L3Harris and Ball Aerospace BLOS datalink solutions.\n\n""The flight demonstrated GA-ASI\'s unmatched ability to fly autonomy on real, tactically relevant, unmanned combat aerial vehicles,"" said GA-ASI Senior Director of Advanced Programs Michael Atwood. ""It displayed effective BLOS Command and Control through the collaboration between three defense primes. This showcases our rapidly maturing CCA mission system suite and moves us one step closer to providing this revolutionary capability to the warfighter.""\n\nGA-ASI leveraged its end-to-end CCA ecosystem for the flight that fused third-party capabilities, human-on-the-loop control, and autonomy to enable effective human-machine teaming for 21st-century conflicts. Operator commands were captured via hands-on throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls and were sent via LEO SATCOM to AI pilots running Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. AI pilots autonomously tracked and manoeuvred around dynamically, and updated entities specified via HOTAS. Operators were provided updates from AI pilots on a cockpit heads-up display and could dynamically re-task via HOTAS as the mission evolved. In addition, data from agent performance was collected and sent to the ground where agents were retrained to improve performance and then redeployed via LEO SATCOM in a matter of minutes.\n\nThis is another in an ongoing series of technology insertion and autonomous flights performed using internal research and development funding to prove out important concepts for UAS.\n\nGeneral Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), an affiliate of General Atomics, is a leading designer and manufacturer of proven, reliable Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) systems, radars, and electro-optic and related mission systems, including the Predator  RPA series and the Lynx  Multi-mode Radar. With more than seven million flight hours, GA-ASI provides long-endurance, mission-capable aircraft with integrated sensor and data link systems required to deliver persistent flight that enables situational awareness and rapid strike. The company also produces a variety of ground control stations and sensor control/image analysis software, offers pilot training and support services, and develops meta-material antennas.\n\nFor more information, visit www.ga-asi.com https://www.suasnews.com/2023/04/ga-asi-flies-mq-20-avenger-autonomously-using-leo-satcom-datalink/"

"Does Your Law Firm Need a Fractional CMO? What can small and midsize firms do to punch above their weight and compete with larger, better funded firms? A fractional CMO can keep your firm focused on big-picture growth goals while managing the pieces and parts of your marketing strategy.\n\nThe challenge for most small and midsize firms is how to manage the marketing process without relying on lawyers and others who run the firm -- people who have excellent lawyering and administrative skills, but not necessarily marketing skills. Hiring what's called a fractional chief marketing officer (FCMO) can bring professional marketing expertise to your firm without the cost of a full-time marketing executive.\n\nIf you aren't ready to commit to a full-time position, don't have the budget or are between chief marketing officers, FCMOs can be a great option.\n\nA CMO is a marketing executive who handles all aspects of a law firm's marketing strategy, including market research, marketing communications, business development, advertising and public relations. At the highest levels, CMOs sit on the firm executive committee and have a direct role in client relationship management.\n\nJust like it sounds, fractional chief marketing officers -- also known as outsourced CMOs -- are hired for a fraction of the time of a full-time CMO. Essentially, firms hire them as part-time C-level executives or set a temporary working term.\n\nFCMOs are experienced marketers capable of executing your firm's growth strategy and keeping current plans on track. They can synthesize your existing business development and marketing efforts, audit an existing marketing strategy, develop a consistent marketing message and more. They can also help you develop a marketing plan if none exists.\n\nMany firms hire junior marketing coordinators or assistants to handle specific tactical aspects of firm marketing -- events, websites and newsletters, and social media, for example. While this helps remove the marketing burden from lawyers' shoulders, it does not accomplish the same goal as hiring a CMO. Junior marketers simply do not have the strategic capabilities or project management skills needed to have a significant impact on your firm's long-term growth.\n\nKnowing when to hire an FCMO can be transformative.\n\nHere are a few examples of the ways these outsourced CMOs assist law firms.\n\nWhen it comes to everyday tasks, FCMOs can be the solution to a wide range of problems. They could also manage a small marketing team that may be tactically oriented but largely operates without a full understanding of the total legal marketing process.\n\nThe process of business development in the mid-market is largely driven by the lawyers themselves. Very rarely do smaller firms have a fully fledged sales process or sales team that is responsible for business development or proposals. That responsibility rests on the shoulders of individual lawyers. Coaching them on the skills and tactics needed to bring in new business is the cornerstone of law firm growth. A good fractional CMO has the skills to draw this out of the lawyers and can help turn them into rainmakers. That is one of the most important benefits that can accrue to small and midsize firms.\n\nMarketing and sales (business development) are often spoken of as the same thing, but they are absolutely not. Marketing tends to operate more actively at the top of the sales funnel, helping to make potential clients and referral sources aware of the firm and generating leads, while sales tends to operate lower down the funnel, qualifying and closing those leads. Managing both ends of the funnel together is advantageous, but something many firms fail at. An FCMO can make sure strategies are in place to make this work.\n\nRebranding is never easy. When done poorly it can be incredibly detrimental. This is especially true when a rebrand is done piecemeal. For example, when firms rebrand one element (say, the firm website) without integrating everything else that represents their brand, it leads to a disconnected, confusing message that clients and referral sources will notice.\n\nIf you are looking to rebrand or update your brand, it is helpful to have a professional on hand to oversee the process. You want someone inside the firm who knows how to bind all the aspects of marketing and business development into your operations while creating your new brand.\n\nMany firms operate marketing as a number of independent tactics that never build on each other or connect to form a whole, deliberate strategy. Building one tactic on another creates an increasingly impactful marketing effort (1 1   3). Developing this strategy is crucial for firm growth, but it does not necessarily require a full-time person.\n\nAgain, if you've hired a marketing coordinator or assistant to handle events or implement certain tactics, that is not sufficient. The value a fractional CMO brings is the strategic insight and vision to put a proper plan in place. That plan becomes the engine for growth that the coordinator can help implement. In other words, the FCMO helps decide why things need to get done. The coordinator helps implement the what and how.\n\nThese work hand in hand to make your marketing work.\n\nAny firm that does not have a full-time marketing professional onboard could benefit from bringing in a fractional CMO. Firm size does not matter -- what matters is your firm's vision and desire to grow. That said, before hiring an FCMO, make sure your partners are clear on their priorities. You don't want to waste the FCMO's limited time or your marketing budget. The first step before signing a contract or creating a job description might be to conduct an audit of your current marketing activities.\n\nSetting growth goals is easy. Knowing how to achieve those goals is another story. If you have goals you do not know how to achieve, hiring an FCMO may be the right move.\n\nImage   iStockPhoto.com\n\nDon't miss out on our daily practice management tips.

"How OPEC  Punished The Short Sellers In a move officially intended to support ""the stability of the oil market"", the latest production cuts from OPEC  caught the market by surprise and threw the short sellers under the bus.\n\nAmid the oil price selloffs following the banking sector jitters last month, top OPEC  officials spent weeks reassuring market participants that the plunge in oil didn\'t warrant any tweaks to the production cuts agreement. Until they decided it did.\n\nA day before a regularly scheduled OPEC  panel meeting, the biggest OPEC producers in the Middle East and several other members of the OPEC  pact announced on a Sunday a total of 1.16 million bpd of fresh production cuts. The reduction is on top of Russia\'s current 500,000 bpd cut, which was extended until the end of the year.\n\nSaudi Arabia will cut 500,000 bpd and said that the move was ""a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.""\n\nThe announcement came when markets were closed, and OPEC  has undoubtedly bet on a jump in oil prices the moment the markets opened. Oil soared by $6 per barrel on the Monday following the announcement, the biggest single-day surge in prices in over a year.\n\nApart from looking to put an $80 floor under Brent Crude prices, the alliance followed through the proverbial promise of Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman from 2020, ""I\'m going to make sure whoever gambles on this market will be ouching like hell.""\n\nThe most recent data from exchanges showed a massive short covering and a renewed buying spree in oil futures in the two days after OPEC  said it would keep another more than 1 million bpd off the market for the rest of the year.\n\nMoney managers bought the equivalent of 128 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts in the week to April 4, with buying heavily concentrated on the crude oil futures Brent and WTI, according to data from exchanges compiled by Reuters market analyst John Kemp.\n\nThe short positions in Brent were slashed by a massive 46% in the week to April 4, the steepest weekly drop in bearish bets in data going back to 2011, per Bloomberg\'s estimates.\n\nWith the announcement of additional cuts, OPEC  recalibrated the hedge fund positioning to the levels from late January, before the recession and banking sector fears which pushed oil prices down below $80 a barrel to the lowest level in 15 months.\n\nA combination of fresh longs and short covering boosted the net long position – the difference between bullish and bearish bets – in both crude oil contracts.\n\nThe surprise OPEC  production cut triggered the biggest buying spree of WTI and Brent crude oil futures since December 2016, Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Tuesday, commenting on the Commitment of Traders report for the week to April 4.\n\nHedge funds and other money managers ""were forced back on the buy side after OPEC  jolted the markets with a surprise production cut,"" Hansen said.\n\n""In the week to April 4, and especially last Monday April 3, hedge funds turned aggressive buyers thereby boosting their net long by the biggest amount since November 2016.""\n\nBrent buying – with 29,000 contracts of short covering added to 44,000 contracts of fresh longs – was the second highest weekly addition of length on record, while the rise in the net long in WTI was mostly due to short covering, Hansen noted.\n\nHowever, the market could be at risk of a correction, considering the fact that oil has traded within a very tight range and there hasn\'t been follow-through buying since the April 3 surge in prices, he said.\n\nAmid lower-than-usual trading volumes due to the Easter holidays in recent days, the market now awaits news about demand outlooks.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-OPEC-Punished-The-Short-Sellers.html"

"March CPI report released today: Live updates on stock market and more Today we'll be getting a fresh read on inflation. This comes after Friday's jobs report which showed that hiring remains strong despite the headwinds facing the economy. U.S. employers hired 236,000 new workers, a solid gain but the weakest showing since December 2020. The unemployment rate fell from 3.6% to 3.5%.\n\nAfter the jobs report was released, the likelihood of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its meeting next month surged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool which analyzes Fed funds futures contracts data.\n\nLast month's consumer price index report flashed a warning sign to the Fed. Though inflation eased on an annual basis for the eighth straight month, it rose sharply on a monthly basis. That led the Fed to hike interest rates at its last meeting despite financial turmoil following Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.\n\nIf March's CPI report doesn't show that inflation is improving sufficiently, it'll all but guarantee the Fed will hike interest rates by at least a quarter percentage point at its May meeting.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the CPI report at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for May 2-3.\n\nThe current rate of inflation is 6% on annual basis.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg predict prices rose by 0.2% on a monthly basis. On an annual basis, they estimate a 5.2% rise in prices.\n\nCore CPI is a measure of the change in consumer prices excluding energy and food which are generally the most volatile components of CPI.

Serhiy Cherevaty told Ukrainian TV on Tuesday that ""with the current intensity of them being annihilated, unless they change their tactics, I think we\'re talking two months,"" according to a translation by The New Voice of Ukraine.\n\nThe outlet noted that this was Cherevaty\'s personal opinion.\n\n""Being a terrorist organization, they [Wagner] use coercion methods,"" Cherevaty added, saying that its troops fight ""under threat of execution.""\n\nThe intense, months-long battle in Bakhmut, which has been fought on the Russian side primarily by the private military group, has been described as a ""meat grinder.""\n\nIn March, the Institute for the Study of War think tank said that Wagner had been forced to start drawing from its elite fighters due to what it described as ""massive losses"" among the ill-equipped, poorly trained convicts the group initially threw into the battle.\n\nAn unnamed NATO official told CNN in March that Russians were dying at five times the rate of the defending Ukrainian forces in the city.\n\nBut Russia has, in recent weeks, been able to make ""very, very slow progress,"" in Bakhmut, Western officials said at a briefing last Wednesday, per CNN.\n\nOn Friday, UK military intelligence said it is ""highly likely"" that Russian forces had advanced to the city center.\n\nEven so, there are conflicting claims as to the extent of Russian control of the city.\n\nWagner\'s founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Tuesday that his troops held more than 80% of the city, including factories and its administrative center, according to Ukraine\'s Channel 24.\n\nPrigozhin also said on April 3 that his troops had ""legally"" captured the city, as they had managed to hoist a flag from an administrative building, NBC News reported.\n\nCherevaty pushed back on Prigozhin\'s claim. ""I can confidently state that the Ukrainian defense forces control a much larger percentage of the territory of Bakhmut,"" the Ukrainian commander told CNN, without specifying a figure.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War estimated that, as of Tuesday, Russian forces controlled 76.5% of the territory. https://www.businessinsider.com/wagner-group-2-months-human-wave-troops-left-bakhmut-ukraine-2023-4"
"Lindsey Graham chatted and smiled with Saudi Arabia's crown prince, who he previously called an 'unhinged' murderer he'd never work with Sen. Lindsey Graham held a meeting with Saudi Arabia\'s Crown Prince this week, a leader he had previously described as an ""unhinged"" murderer following the assassination of dissident Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday, Graham said he had just had a ""very productive, candid meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince and his senior leadership team.\n\n""The opportunity to enhance the U.S.-Saudi relationship is real and the reforms going on in Saudi Arabia are equally real,"" he added.\n\nThe government-linked Saudi Press Agency (SPA) released pictures of the meeting, in which the South Carolina senator and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman are pictured laughing, flanked by top US and Saudi officials.\n\nIn his tweets, Graham said he thanked the crown prince for a recent multi-billion dollar Saudi deal for Boeing jets, which are manufactured in South Carolina.\n\n""Investments like this are game changers,"" said Graham.\n\nNeither Graham nor the SPA mentioned that the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi royal family, had been among the issues discussed.\n\nThe murder of Khashoggi, who was killed and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, prompted an international outcry.\n\nGraham was among the most prominent figures in the US calling for the crown prince to be punished over the killing, which the CIA believes he personally ordered. Saudi Arabia denies he had any involvement.\n\n""This guy has got to go,"" Graham said in a 2018 Fox News interview, and said the crown prince had Khashoggi ""murdered.""\n\n""Saudi Arabia, if you\'re listening, there are a lot of good people you can choose,"" Graham said. ""But MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has tainted your country and tainted yourself.""\n\nGraham, who had previously supported closer US-Saudi ties, in the same interview said he would not be ""going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy is in charge.""\n\n""If he is going to be the face of Saudi Arabia going forward, I think the kingdom will have a hard time on the world stage,"" Graham told NBC in a separate interview.\n\n""They are an important ally, but when it comes to the crown prince, he is irrational, he is unhinged, and I think he has done a lot of damage to the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia and I have no intention of working with him ever again.""\n\nGraham is not the first US politician to make a dramatic u-turn in his attitude towards the Saudi leader.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had pledged to make the crown prince a ""pariah"" while seeking election in 2020, but as president has instead chosen to maintain an alliance. https://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-meets-mohammed-bin-salman-called-murderer-saudi-khashoggi-2023-4"
"Two of Ken Griffin's biggest donations sit on opposite sides of the spectrum Hiya! Dan DeFrancesco in NYC, and as a frequent orderer of takeout, I\'m enthralled by the recent debate over tipping etiquette for delivery drivers.\n\nToday, we\'ve got stories on a fintech\'s partnership with a Marvel star, landlords are not having fun these days, and a breakdown of how much you can really save moving out of NYC.\n\nBut first, is this a tax write-off?\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider\'s app here.\n\nBillionaire hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin is back in the news, but this time it\'s for what he\'s giving, not taking (in).\n\nGriffin, who founded Wall Street giants Citadel and Citadel Securities, donated $300 million to Harvard\'s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS).\n\nThe gift to his alma mater -- Griffin graduated in 1989 -- is ""unrestricted,"" meaning it can be used anywhere within the FAS, which includes the undergraduate program as well as the school\'s PhD programs.\n\nFor his generosity (he\'s donated more than $500 million to the school over the years), Griffin will get his name on the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nI\'ve written a lot about Griffin this year, and for good reason. His hedge fund had a monster 2022, and his trading firm remains a key piece of how the markets operate. He\'s also starting to wield that power outside of Wall Street, most notably in politics by becoming a megadonor to Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nGriffin\'s philanthropic efforts have spanned a wide range of venues, from a traveling exhibition on Antarctic dinosaurs to building youth soccer fields in Miami.\n\nHowever, it\'s interesting to see how two of his biggest contributions -- DeSantis and Harvard -- seem to operate on opposite ends of the spectrum. DeSantis, who holds degrees from Yale University and Harvard Law School, called his Ivy League education ""political scarlet letters"" as a GOP candidate in his new book. (Griffin, for what it\'s worth, reportedly once privately complained about ""woke ideology"" impacting kids in school.)\n\nThe pessimistic person might view this as Griffin paying for more influence at Harvard. Understand, though, that while $300 million might seem like a lot, it\'s still a drop in the bucket of the school\'s $50.9 billion endowment.\n\nBut maybe it\'s not as Machiavellian as that! After all, some of Griffin\'s donations previously went to funding research on stem cells, per Bloomberg. Maybe it\'s just his way of giving back to the place where he got his start.\n\nClick her to read our profile on Ken Griffin\'s rise to the top of Wall Street.\n\n2.

"The Egyptian traditions endangered by rampant inflation Multiday weddings, the bereaved feeding the poor, and households taking pride in having the best homemade bread are all becoming things of the past in rural Egypt as centuries-old traditions are squeezed by a punishing economic crisis.\n\nUp and down the country, more and more Egyptians – crushed under the weight of 33.9 percent annual inflation, as of March – are having to abandon once-cherished rituals of celebration and mourning.\n\nIn the Nile Delta, grooms once threw elaborate bachelor parties before their weddings, erecting large traditional tents, hiring bands and butchering cattle to feed guests from far and wide.\n\n""Hardly anyone does it any more,"" 33-year-old engineer Mohamed Shedid told AFP news agency from his home town of Quwesna in Menoufia, 70km (43 miles) north of Cairo.\n\n""We used to blame it on COVID, but then immediately afterwards everyone was hit by the economic crisis,"" which has pushed the price of meat beyond the reach of most families.\n\nEven before the current crisis – worsened by Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine last year, which destabilised crucial food imports – 30 percent of Egyptians were living under the poverty line, and the same number were vulnerable to joining them, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn the Nubian south at the other end of the country, ""soaring costs mean our weddings and funerals aren\'t what they once were"", said Omar Maghrabi, a 43-year-old Nubian language teacher.\n\n""Things are really hard, families need the money we once spent on these events just to keep households running.""\n\nIn a year, the Egyptian pound has lost nearly half of its value, pushing consumer prices to more than double in the import-dependent country.\n\nWeddings in Nubian villages are no longer three-day, nine-meal affairs to which the entire town is invited.\n\n""A few months ago, there was a kind of agreement among the villages to make weddings more affordable,"" Maghrabi told AFP.\n\n""Now the hosts only have to offer a light dinner"" instead of the old festivities, which used to last ""up to a week for the richest families"".\n\nWith everyone keeping an iron grip on their purse strings, brides have also grown less discerning when it comes to wedding rings.\n\n""Rings had to be a certain weight of gold before,"" the teacher said, but they have now grown finer and lighter.\n\nWith newlyweds unable to keep up with skyrocketing gold prices, the highest Muslim authority in Egypt said in March there was no religious objection to swapping gold for cheaper alternatives, namely silver.\n\nIn the tightly-knit agricultural villages of Upper Egypt, which extend southwards from Cairo along the narrow green strip of the Nile Valley, funerals are a communal affair.\n\nWith each death, families rush to bring convoys of food trays to the deceased\'s relatives, who quickly run out of storage space and call on neighbours and guests to help rid them of the feasts.\n\nBut now, ""it\'s agreed that only the immediate family will cook for the bereaved"", former parliamentarian Mohamed Refaat Abdel Aal, 68, told AFP from his village of el-Adadiya in Qena, five hours south of Cairo.\n\n""Some families are also suggesting that we limit ourselves to just the funeral, and forgo the wake,"" which at the bare minimum means serving drinks to guests offering condolences.\n\nNo commodity has been left undisturbed by price hikes, including coffee and – catastrophically for rural families who cherish their baking skills – flour.\n\nEgyptian baladi bread is a staple on every table in every village, town and megacity. In Upper Egypt, it was a source of pride for families always to make their own.\n\n""It used to be shameful for families in villages to go and buy bread from a bakery. It would mean the house had grown lazy and complacent,"" Abdel Aal said.\n\nBut with the cost of grain rising 70 percent in a year, he added that ""everyone is lining up outside bakeries"" run by the government.\n\nAt least they can get subsidised bread there – even if it tastes nothing like what they would make at home. https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/12/the-egyptian-traditions-endangered-by-rampant-inflation"

"'I was up to my waist down a hippo's throat.' He survived, and here's his advice Paul Templer was living his best life.\n\nHe was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.\n\nHe had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa\'s bush country ""and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.""\n\nTempler said Zimbabwe\'s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area\'s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.\n\n""It was idyllic,"" he told CNN Travel recently. ""Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.""\n\nA good day for a river trek\n\nMarch 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal\'s place. ""I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.""\n\nThe expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.\n\nAnd down the famed Zambezi they went. ""Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.""\n\nPossible trouble ahead\n\nEventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That\'s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa\'s fourth-longest river. They weren\'t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But ""we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let\'s just paddle safely around the hippos.""\n\nTempler\'s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer\'s not sure how that happened.\n\nSuddenly, there\'s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air.\n\n""Suddenly, there\'s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe."" The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.\n\n""Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I\'ve got to get him out quickly. I don\'t have time to drop my clients off."" He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.\n\nBen got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn\'t climb.\n\nAttempting a rescue\n\nMeanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer\'s canoe.\n\n""I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you\'ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,"" he said.\n\n""But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that\'s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,"" he said. ""So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.""\n\nHe was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.\n\n""I\'m leaning over – it\'s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn\'t see a thing.""\n\nWhat happened next was nightmarish and surreal.\n\n""My world went dark and strangely quiet."" Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.\n\n""From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn\'t wet like the river, but it wasn\'t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn\'t.\n\n""I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo\'s throat.""\n\nHippos: Huge, territorial and dangerous\n\nThere\'s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.\n\nThey sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.\n\nTheir teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.\n\nThey\'re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar\'s menagerie).\n\nHippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.\n\nHippos and humans\n\nThey also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don\'t get reported.\n\n""The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: \'Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?\' Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.\n\n""I\'m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.""\n\nDr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Fund, said the AWF doesn\'t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.\n\nWhile more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.\n\n\'He spat me out\'\n\nThose were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.\n\n""I\'m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, \'We got to get out of here!\' ""\n\nSo once again, I\'m up to my waist down the hippo\'s throat. But this time, my legs are trapped but my hands are free.\n\nBut Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him ""and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver\'s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I\'m up to my waist down the hippo\'s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.""\n\nHe tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn\'t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time.\n\n""This time when I come to the surface I look around, there\'s no sign of Evans."" Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.\n\n""I\'m making pretty good progress and I\'m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I\'ll remember this – there\'s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.""\n\nThis time, Templer was sideways in the hippo\'s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.\n\nTotal fury\n\n""And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they\'re attacking,"" Templer said.\n\n""For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he\'d go under water, I\'d hold my breath. When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me"" to stop from being ripped apart.\n\nTempler said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a ""vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.""\n\nHe figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – ""showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face."" Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and ""Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.""\n\nThe expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.\n\nWho gets attacked and why\n\nPeople living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.\n\n""Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,"" Lewison said.\n\nHuman encroachment from Africa\'s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.\n\nDespite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.\n\n""Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),"" Muruthi said.\n\n""Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,"" Lewison said. ""I don\'t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.""\n\nStuck on a rock and in a hard place\n\nBack on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, ""He\'s gone, man, he\'s just gone.""\n\nTempler knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but ""first I needed to settle myself down.""\n\nHe assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.\n\n""My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer."" He couldn\'t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was ""crushed to a pulp.""\n\nBlood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.\n\nTempler made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.\n\nHe was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.\n\nHe described ""a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?""\n\nIt was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn\'t, I kind of wished I would.\n\nPaul Templer on the pain after the attack\n\n""I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn\'t, I kind of wished I would.""\n\nBen and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn\'t have any signs of animal attack on him.\n\n""Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.""\n\nMeanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.\n\n""And that was my bad day at the office.""\n\nNext ordeal: Getting medical help\n\nTempler was out of the river but not out of the woods.\n\nIt took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month\'s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn\'t think he\'d live.\n\nBut not only did the surgeon save Templer\'s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.\n\nHe realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. ""I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.""\n\nBut then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was ""emotionally all over the map.""\n\nHe got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis ""and then just started trying to get back to life.""\n\nHow to stay safe in hippo country\n\nTempler, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place.\n\n""Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,"" Lewison said.\n\n""Do not get close to them,"" Muruthi said. ""They don\'t want any intrusion. … They\'re not predators; it\'s by accident if they\'re injuring people.""\n\nWant close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.\n\nFollow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says \'Stay in your vehicle,\' then stay in your vehicle.\n\nPhilip Muruthi on avoiding hippo attacks\n\nDo not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don\'t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.\n\n""Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says \'Stay in your vehicle,\' then stay in your vehicle. And even when you\'re in your vehicle, don\'t drive it right to the animal.""\n\nMuruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. ""It\'s good for them to know you\'re around.""\n\n""Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,"" Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.\n\nWarning signals\n\nGet to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.\n\n""These are signs you should have left already!"" Muruthi said.\n\nIf you\'ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.\n\nMuruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it\'s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.\n\nWhat if you\'re in a small watercraft?\n\n""Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you\'ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,"" Templer said. ""If you\'re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.""\n\nIt\'s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.\n\nOnce an attack is underway\n\nUnlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.\n\n""Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,"" Muruthi said. ""Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape."" He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that\'s a tall order.\n\nHippos typically hole punch you, so there isn\'t much you can do if they get hold of you.\n\n""Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn\'t much you can do if they get hold of you,"" Lewison said.\n\nBased on his attack, Templer said try not to panic ""when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.""\n\nAnother hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo\'s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.\n\n\'You\'re the sum of your choices\'\n\nTwo years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).\n\nHow did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?\n\nAfter a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: ""You\'re the sum of your choices. You\'re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.""\n\nTempler said he focused on what\'s possible vs. what he\'s lost. ""If you look for what\'s possible, it generally is.""\n\nTempler later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book ""What\'s Left of Me""; and is a speaker.\n\nIs a safari advisable?\n\nShould people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer\'s?\n\nMuruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. ""In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,"" he said.\n\nTempler said his attack was an ""anomaly,"" and he doesn\'t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.\n\n""My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they\'re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it. https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html"

"Elon Musk: My dog is running Twitter now Elon Musk recently painted over the ""w"" in the ""Twitter"" sign at the company headquarters in San Francisco, turning it into ""Titter.(Opens in a new tab)"" But if you need more proof that things are falling apart at the social media site, we present to you the Musk\'s latest interview with the BBC\'s James Clayton(Opens in a new tab), in which he claims Twitter is now being run by his dog.\n\nFirst, it\'s worth addressing the awkwardness of the interview (you can watch parts of it in the video below), which was broadcast on Twitter Spaces on Wednesday. Musk does his typical dance between attempting to be funny and eliciting sympathy by saying how hard it has been to lay off a massive number of Twitter employees. But when asked whether the sacked employees should\'ve been given prior notice, the Twitter CEO avoids answering, instead passing the ball back to Clayton. And when questioned on the rise of misinformation and fake news on Twitter since Musk took over, he seemingly gets irritated, asking the interviewer to name one example from personal use (for the record, there are studies that point to the increase of ""misinformation superspreaders"" on Musk\'s Twitter(Opens in a new tab)).\n\nKey points from the interview, which mostly revolves around Twitter, include the social media company being down to just 1,500 employees (down from more than 7,000), Musk\'s admission that shutting down a Twitter data center(Opens in a new tab) in December 2022 was ""quite catastrophic,"" and that Twitter is currently bleeding money(Opens in a new tab) but it\'s on the path of being cashflow positive ""within months. "" On the topic of frequent Twitter outages as of late, Musk says there have been ""a few,"" but ""not for very long.""\n\nPerhaps the biggest admission from Musk is that he ultimately went through with the Twitter acquisition deal because he felt the court would make him do it. ""Yes, that is the reason,"" Musk told the BBC.\n\nAs far as who\'s running things at Twitter right now (Musk previously said he would abide by the results of a Twitter poll, in which users decided he should step down as CEO), he told Clayton it was his dog, Floki.\n\n""I\'m not the CEO of Twitter. My dog is the CEO of Twitter. It\'s a great dog."" Musk said. ""He\'s got a black turtleneck, what more would you need?""\n\nMusk also admitted that he shot himself in the foot with his tweets ""multiple times,"" and that he should probably stop tweeting after 3 a.m. ""I need bulletproof shoes at this point,"" he said. https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-dog-bbc-interview"
"Washington Post chides White House for shifting blame on Afghanistan: 'Disappointment' A White House report shifts blame for the withdrawal chaos.\n\nThe Washington Post\'s Editorial Board chided the Biden administration to ""share blame"" for the Kabul debacle after it released a report absolving the president of any responsibility for the botched withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August of 2021.\n\n""Instead of admitting errors, the 12-page document mostly repeats familiar talking points and shifts the blame to Mr. Biden\'s predecessor, Donald Trump,"" the board wrote.\n\nReleased last week, the report defended Biden\'s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan but didn\'t appear to acknowledge any mistakes made by the president.

"Pro-life Republicans say FDA approval of abortion pill was illegal, ask appeals court to uphold injunction The HHS secretary also scorched the Texas judge\'s ruling on the abortion pill as un-American.\n\nA group of 69 Republican lawmakers are asking a federal appeals court to uphold the injunction issued by a Texas judge last week that would halt the Food and Drug Administration\'s more than two-decade old approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nIn court documents filed Tuesday, the GOP members of Congress write that they are ""committed to protecting women and girls from the harms of the abortion industry."" They assert FDA approval of medication abortions, which they call chemical abortions, was ""unlawful.""\n\n""By approving and deregulating chemical abortion drugs, the FDA has not followed Congress\' statutorily prescribed drug approval process and has subverted Congress\' critical public policy interests in upholding patient welfare,"" the Republicans argue. ""The FDA\'s lawless actions ultimately endanger women and girls seeking chemical abortions.""\n\nThe brief was led by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas.

(Paul Ratje/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nLast week, in an unprecedented and highly controversial decision, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk issued an injunction against the FDA\'s approval of mifepristone, a popular drug used in more than half of all abortions in the U.S. The Biden administration quickly filed an appeal to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nMifepristone, under the brand name Mifeprex, is part of a two-drug regimen that first blocks hormones needed to keep an unborn baby alive and then causes cramps and contractions to expel the dead fetus from the mother\'s womb.\n\nThe drug was approved by the FDA in 2000. Since then, medication abortions have grown in popularity and now make up nearly 60% of all abortions in the United States. More than five million women in the United States have used mifepristone to abort their pregnancies, according to the drug\'s manufacturer.\n\nGROWING NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIC STATES ARE STOCKPILING ABORTION DRUGS\n\nA Texas judge has halted FDA approval of mifepristone, a drug used to induce abortions.

"Israel bans non-Muslims from Al-Aqsa until end of Ramadan Israel has halted visits by Jews and tourists to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound after a wave of unrest in the holy city of Jerusalem.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday that visits by non-Muslims to the sacred compound – which is known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), their third-holiest site, and to Jews as the Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism – will be stopped until the end of Ramadan, expected around April 20.\n\nLast week, Israeli police conducted consecutive raids at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. On the first night, at least 12 Palestinians were arrested and more than 400 were arrested.\n\nThe raids triggered rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon and Syria, which drew Israeli air and artillery raids.\n\nThe statement from Netanyahu\'s office was issued after Israel\'s top security officials held talks. It said the ban was unanimously recommended by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Israeli police Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai.\n\nGallant confirmed the unanimous agreement among the security chiefs in his own office\'s statement.\n\nIsraeli media reported that Netanyahu directed security agencies to deploy all necessary forces to secure the Western Wall for continued Jewish worship outside the compound. The wall is a holy site in the Jewish faith and a place for prayer. Muslims call it the Buraq Wall.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials on the ban, which Israel has imposed in previous years.\n\nThe increased number of ultranationalist Jews entering the compound and the frequent storming of the site by Israeli security forces, including inside the prayer hall of Al-Aqsa Mosque, has increased Palestinian anger.\n\nIsraeli authorities have regularly suspended the entry of Jewish settlers and other non-Muslims to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound during the final 10 days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan to try to maintain the status quo and dissipate tensions provoked by the visits.\n\nIn previous years, a resumption of the visits after Ramadan has seen Jewish settlers enter the holy site in groups of a few hundred under the protection of Israeli police. These incidents also saw dozens of Palestinians injured and hundreds arrested.\n\nNetanyahu\'s far-right police minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, however, denounced the ban as ""a serious mistake that will not bring peace, rather risks escalating the security situation further"".\n\n""When terrorism strikes us, we must strike back with great force, not surrender to its whims,"" he said in a statement.\n\nHe claimed the ban would also mean fewer Israeli police officers stationed at the site, ""which will create fertile ground for massive demonstrations of incitement to murder Jews and even a scenario in which stones will be thrown at Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall"", the Times of Israel reported.\n\nBen-Gvir has regularly entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in what Palestinians have called ""deliberate provocation"".\n\nViolence between Israelis and Palestinians has been escalating over the past year, and nearly 100 Palestinians have been killed since the start of 2023. This has caused tensions to run especially high in the Holy Land as Ramadan and the Jewish Passover have coincided. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/israel-bans-non-muslims-from-al-aqsa-until-end-of-ramadan"

"Main Street investors bet on comeback for regional banks Forget the banking crisis -- Main Street\'s retail investors have barreled into embattled bank stocks. It looks like nothing tempts people to bet on an industry more than bargain prices, even if they\'re caused by the fear of imminent collapse.\n\nIn January and February, trading in First Republic Bank (FRC) stock was outright sleepy. Retail investors averaged just about $20,000 in daily net purchases. After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, however, that daily average exploded to $10.3 million, according to data through April 10 from VandaTrack.\n\nTD Ameritrade\'s Investment Movement Index, which tracks retail traders, found that its clients were net buyers of First Republic Bank in March even as the company\'s shares plummeted more than 88% over worries about uninsured deposits and the overall health of the banking system.\n\nSo far -- and it\'s very early days -- the optimism hasn\'t paid off: First Republic has been circling $15 a share for the last month, down from a range of $115 to $145 a share in the first two months of 2023.\n\nPacWest Bancorp (PACW), meanwhile, another regional bank that sank in the immediate aftermath of the recent turmoil, saw post-SVB retail net purchases of its stock jump to an average of $2.9 million a day, up from virtually none in the first two months of the year. Again, buyers got bargains, paying $9 a share for a stock that had been trading around $30 in the previous few months.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, which tracks a range of mid-sized banks, saw overall net purchases grow to an average $3.9 million a day, up from net sales of $120,000 for January and February.\n\nIt\'s not just regional banks. Individual investors have been piling into big bank stocks like Bank of America (BAC), Citi (C)group, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFCPRL), data from VandaTrack showed.\n\nTD Ameritrade found that the buying interest amongst retail investors was strongest in the financial sector, which was down almost 10% during the period.\n\nRetail investors sought out an opportunity to make ""big pay-outs on a return of confidence,"" in the banking industry, said Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at VandaTrack.\n\nAt the same time, he said, institutional investors, the so-called ""smart money,"" have been trading out of volatile regional bank stocks.\n\nReddit, meanwhile, is full of posts with titles like ""First Republic Bank is easy money"" and ""Regional Banks are significantly undervalued after SVB failure.""\n\nThe worry: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned last week in an interview with CNN that the banking crisis is far from over and that its consequences will likely be felt for years.\n\nThat could mean bad news for those who are betting they\'ll see big returns on regional bank stocks. This is a risky move for retail investors, said Iachini, and a speculative play.\n\nAnd while retail flows into bank stocks are still high, they have waned significantly since mid-March. ""That tells me retail capital isn\'t here to stay,"" said Iachini.\n\nWe\'re not seeing a meaningful recovery, at least yet, for regional bank stocks, he said. What we\'re seeing instead is a light version of what happened as individual investors fueled meme stocks in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nWhy Warren Buffett likes Japan\'s trading houses\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has set his eyes on Osaka.\n\nIn an interview with Japanese news agency Nikkei on Tuesday, billionaire investing wiz Warren Buffett said that he plans on adding to his investments in Japan.\n\nIn August 2020, Buffett\'s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had purchased a stake of about 5% in Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Marubeni. He increased his holdings of those five financial ""trading houses"" in November.\n\nInvestors abroad often shy away from investing in Japanese trading houses -- they\'re large complex corporations involved in trading, investing, financing, and importing/exporting and often have business units all over the world. They also tend to be relatively secretive about their business operations.\n\nBut Buffett said Wednesday that he wasn\'t bothered by the complexity of investing in these multi-faceted entities.\n\n""We feel that these five companies are a cross section of not only Japan but of the world,"" he said. ""They are really so much similar to Berkshire. They own a lot of different things.""\n\nBuffett gave the rare interview in Tokyo where he plans to meet with all five companies this week ""to really just have a discussion around their businesses and emphasize our support.""

"LA auctioneer to plead guilty to creating fake artwork attributed to Neo-expressionist painter Basquiat Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA former Los Angeles auctioneer has agreed to plead guilty in a cross-country art fraud scheme where he created fake artwork and falsely attributed the paintings to artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nThe paintings ultimately wound up at the Orlando Museum of Art in Florida before they were seized by federal agents last year in a scandal that roiled the museum and led to its CEO\'s departure after he threatened an art expert and told her to ""shut up.""\n\nBasquiat, a Neo-expressionist painter whose success came during the 1980s, lived and worked in New York before he died in 1988 at age 27 from a drug overdose. The Orlando Museum of Art scandal came in 2022 when a federal raid ended in the seizure of 25 paintings whose authenticity had been in question for a decade. The museum had been the first to display the artwork, and its former director had previously insisted the artwork was legitimate.\n\nFLORIDA PRINCIPAL FORCED TO RESIGN AFTER SHOWING STUDENTS MICHELANGELO\'S \'DAVID\' STATUE\n\nDefendant Michael Barzman, 45, was charged Tuesday in federal court in Los Angeles with making false statements to the FBI during an interview last year, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office said in a news release. He has agreed to plead guilty and faces up to five years in prison.\n\nBarzman\'s court date has not been scheduled. Barzman admitted that he and another man, identified only as ""J.F."" in court papers, had created the bogus paintings and agreed to split the sales\' proceeds.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel work outside the Orlando Museum of Art on June 24, 2022.

""In desperation, he participated in this scheme because he was afraid of losing his health insurance. Since then, he has cooperated and done everything asked of him to compensate for his poor judgement.""\n\nMark Elliott, the chairman of the Orlando museum\'s board of trustees, said in a statement that the museum ""has recommitted itself to its mission to provide excellence in the visual arts with its exhibitions, collections, and educational programming"" in the wake of the scandal.\n\nBarzman admitted to the FBI -- after repeated denials in interviews with federal agents, leading to Tuesday\'s felony charge -- that he made a false provenance for the paintings by claiming in a notarized document that they had been found in television writer Thad Mumford\'s storage locker.\n\nMAYOR OF FLORENCE, ITALY, SHOVES, CURSES AT CLIMATE ACTIVISTS FOR VANDALIZING HISTORIC BUILDING\n\nBarzman previously ran an auction business where he bought and resold the contents of unpaid storage units. He bought Mumford\'s locker in 2012.\n\nMumford, who died in 2018, told investigators he had never owned any Basquiat art, and the paintings were not in the unit the last time he had opened it.\n\nExperts pointed out that the cardboard used in at least one of the pieces included FedEx typeface that wasn\'t used until 1994, about six years after Basquiat died, according to a federal search warrant.

"Biden Looks To Boost EV Uptake With Strictest-Ever Vehicle Pollution Standards The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed on Wednesday the toughest-ever tailpipe emission standards for new cars and trucks, aiming to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles to the point of EVs becoming a larger portion of new sales than conventional vehicles by 2032.\n\nDepending on the compliance pathways manufacturers select to meet the proposed standards, EPA projects that EVs could account for 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales and 46% of new medium-duty vehicle sales for model year 2032.\n\nThe proposed MY 2032 light-duty standards are expected to result in a 56% reduction in projected fleet average greenhouse gas emissions target levels compared to the existing MY 2026 standards. The proposed MY 2032 medium-duty vehicle standards would result in a 44% reduction compared to MY 2026 standards, according to EPA\'s proposal.\n\nThe agency expects the proposals would reduce oil imports by approximately 20 billion barrels. Overall, EPA estimates that the benefits of the proposed standards would exceed costs by at least $1 trillion, the agency said.\n\n""These ambitious standards are readily achievable thanks to President Biden\'s Investing in America agenda, which is already driving historic progress to build more American-made electric cars and secure America\'s global competitiveness,"" said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive Innovation has warned that a massive rollout of EVs will depend not only on automakers but also on the grid and charging infrastructure investments.\n\n""A lot has to go right for this massive -- and unprecedented -- change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,"" John Bozzella, head of the alliance, told Bloomberg.\n\nEarlier this year, the Biden Administration announced actions to significantly expand the U.S. electric vehicle charger network to support its EV sales goals and back the Made-in-America manufacturing of components for charging stations. The set of actions is expected to help the Administration\'s EV sales goals by building a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers along America\'s highways and in communities and have EVs make up at least 50% of new car sales by 2030.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Biden-Looks-To-Boost-EV-Uptake-With-Strictest-Ever-Vehicle-Pollution-Standards.html"
"Garmin's New $450 Instinct 2X Solar Has 'Unlimited Battery Life,' LED Flashlight and More     - CNET When it comes to smartwatches with the best battery life, Garmin tops the list. For years, the company has made fitness trackers with smartwatch features that last for weeks without needing to be charged. It\'s just introduced the latest addition to its Instinct series with the Instinct 2X Solar and Instinct 2X Solar Tactical Edition.\n\nOn the surface, they look similar to the Garmin Instinct 2, released last year, Garmin\'s added several new features. The Instinct 2X Solar is available starting right now, with a retail price of $450. The Tactical Edition will run an extra $50, making it $500.\n\nSo, what does the Instinct 2X Solar do that last year\'s Instinct 2 couldn\'t? The big addition here to the hardware is that the Instinct 2X Solar now comes with a multi-LED flashlight, similar to the one found on the Enduro 2, which can light in both white and a green to help avoid from the overly bright light messing with your vision at night. It has a larger bezel, uses Garmin\'s Power Glass solar charging lens on the display to maximize battery life and comes preloaded with a ton of new obstacle course activities, including running, skiing and more.\n\nThe Instinct 2X Solar also adds several of the best fitness-related features from other recent Garmin models, including Training Readiness, Morning Report and more. It\'s the first in the Instinct line to have Obstacle Course Racing as an activity and also has TracBack routing, more sport-specific apps and heart-rate variability tracking.\n\nIn smartwatch mode, which offers notifications for both Android and iOS users, you can now get ""unlimited battery life."" Garmin makes this claim based on all-day wear usage with an average of three hours per day outside in 50,000 lux conditions. In areas that are very sunny, it may take less than three hours to reach that, while other areas may require additional light to meet the 50,000 lux conditions. That does mean that you may notice the battery drop at times, but if you spend enough time outside you\'ll never really have to worry about charging the watch or disabling features to get longer battery life. https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/garmins-new-450-instinct-2x-solar-has-unlimited-battery-life-led-flashlight-and-more/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"Dozens of dead stingrays found on beach in Brazil Dozens of dead stingrays appeared on a beach in Rio de Janeiro this week, sparking confusion and concern in the local community.\n\nLocal fishermen reported the first sightings early on Tuesday.

"March CPI report released today: Live updates on stock market and more Today we'll be getting a fresh read on inflation. This comes after Friday's jobs report which showed that hiring remains strong despite the headwinds facing the economy. U.S. employers hired 236,000 new workers, a solid gain but the weakest showing since December 2020. The unemployment rate fell from 3.6% to 3.5%.\n\nAfter the jobs report was released, the likelihood of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its meeting next month surged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool which analyzes Fed funds futures contracts data.\n\nLast month's consumer price index report flashed a warning sign to the Fed. Though inflation eased on an annual basis for the eighth straight month, it rose sharply on a monthly basis. That led the Fed to hike interest rates at its last meeting despite financial turmoil following Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.\n\nIf March's CPI report doesn't show that inflation is improving sufficiently, it'll all but guarantee the Fed will hike interest rates by at least a quarter percentage point at its May meeting.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the CPI report at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for May 2-3.\n\nThe current rate of inflation is 6% on annual basis.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg predict prices rose by 0.2% on a monthly basis.

"Biden faces fragile moment in Northern Ireland as he marks Good Friday Agreement BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- President Joe Biden will look to navigate political turmoil that hangs over fragile peace in Northern Ireland as he celebrates the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in a speech from Belfast Wednesday.\n\nBiden kicks off a three-day trip in the United Kingdom and Ireland with remarks commemorating a widely heralded accord that ended three decades of civil war in Northern Ireland known as ""The Troubles.""\n\nBut the Northern Ireland government hasn\'t operated for more than a year amid a political impasse between Northern Ireland\'s two major parties: British unionists and Irish nationalists.\n\nMore:President Biden visits Northern Ireland amid thwarted IRA bomb plot and fragile peace\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly has stopped convening altogether. So instead of addressing a packed parliament building that overlooks Belfast, Biden will speak at Ulster University, Belfast\'s largest public university with no religious affiliation.\n\n""Keep the peace,"" Biden said before heading overseas. ""That\'s the main thing."" He added: ""Keep your fingers crossed.""\n\nThe 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which the Clinton administration helped broker, established a devolved local government in Northern Ireland with power shared among Protestant loyalist parties that pushed to remain part of the U.K. and Irish Catholic nationalist parties that sought to unify with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBut members of the Democratic Unionist Party – conservatives who backed the United Kingdom\'s withdrawal from the EU – pulled out of the shared-power agreement after Brexit.\n\nMore:\'Simple dignity\': How President Biden\'s visit to Ireland tells the story of \'Blue-collar Joe\' back home\n\nThey oppose an arrangement between the U.K. and EU that preserved the free flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which share the only land border between the U.K. and the EU.\n\n""The message really is congratulations on this anniversary,"" said John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council. But he added: ""We\'d like to see the National Assembly returned, clearly""\n\nOn the streets of Belfast, residents seem generally excited about Biden\'s visit – but several took note of his short stay.\n\nBiden will spend less than one day in Northern Ireland before spending the bulk of his trip in the Republic Ireland.\n\nThat\'s probably not by accident given the politically sensitive time in Northern Ireland.\n\nBiden has drawn past criticism from unionists. Even so, the president probably wants to avoid taking sides among the competing parties. And less time in Belfast means fewer chances to ruffle feathers.\n\nAmanda Sloat, the NSC\'s senior director for Europe, reiterated that the main purpose of Biden\'s trip to Northern Ireland is to ""mark the anniversary"" of the Good Friday Agreement when asked about efforts to engage with the Democratic Unionist Party,\n\nSloat disputed the perception, suggested by a reporter, that Biden\'s trip is a ""taxpayer-funded family reunion,"" pointing to Biden\'s packed schedule of events.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/12/biden-belfast-political-unrest-marks-good-friday-agreement-anniversary/11640834002/"

"Big banks' balance sheets will swell after the recent turmoil &ndash; and that could be bad news for Americans, ex-Barclays boss says Wall Street banks could be about to give their shareholders a pleasant surprise – but the likely growth in their balance sheets is bad news for ordinary Americans, according to Bob Diamond.\n\nThe former Barclays CEO expects the biggest lenders in the US to reveal this earnings season that their balance sheets have swelled, after customers switched deposits out of smaller banks facing high-profile struggles.\n\nThat rush of inflows could concentrate risk in a few lenders and push up costs for consumers, said Diamond, now the CEO of investment firm Atlas Merchant Capital.\n\n""To the extent that you see deposits move just into the larger banks and we get more and more concentration, there\'s not only more risk in the system, but more importantly, there\'s less competition and less service for small businesses and communities,"" he told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday.\n\nThe likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are expected to post first-quarter 2023 earnings over the coming week. Those will offer investors a chance to gauge how those big banks fared through March\'s banking turmoil, which arose from the collapse of California lender SVB Financial.\n\nUS customers flooded Wall Street banking giants with billions of dollars\' worth of deposits in the days after SVB failed last month, according to a Reuters report that cited sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAmericans pulled their funds from smaller lenders in massive amounts thanks to Main Street\'s fear that SVB\'s collapse would spread stresses across the US regional banking sector, and eventually lead to the failure of more banks.\n\nDiamond -- who ran Barclays between 2011 and 2012 before resigning over an interest-rate rigging scandal -- believes big banks\' trading departments will have benefited from the turmoil, seizing on volatility for both stocks and US Treasury bonds to deliver strong returns.\n\n""I think we\'re going to get a positive surprise by the amount of business that\'s moved from small banks to the larger banks -- not just deposits, but people opening up more and more accounts,"" Diamond told Bloomberg.\n\n""I think we\'ll get a pleasant surprise by the trading revenues. Whenever you see this much volatility in the securities market and this kind of movement in US Treasury yields and rates, the banks should do very, very well,"" he added.\n\nBut what\'s good for the banks isn\'t necessarily good news for the US as a whole, according to Diamond.\n\nHe noted that the US has thousands of regional lenders. A concentration of deposits in the hands of a few large lenders would damage most of those institutions, by reducing competition and pushing up banking costs for the average American.\n\n""We have 4,500 banks in this country,"" Diamond said. ""No other country has a banking system like the US.""\n\n""The positive impact that has by providing a better cost structure to lending, to farmers, to small communities, to regions … the competitive nature of those 4,500 banks is very very positive in terms of reducing the overall cost to the consumer,"" he added.\n\nRead more: NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo spread his money across half a dozen bank accounts as a rookie because of the FDIC\'s $250,000 limit.

"People on TikTok are 'mewing.' Experts weigh in on this controversial beauty hack Influencers on TikTok say ""mewing"" is the latest quick-fix beauty trend to dramatically change one\'s face. Medical experts aren\'t buying it.\n\n""You see these dramatic posts on social media where somebody looks like they have a frog neck and then all of a sudden they have this perfectly defined jawline,"" says plastic surgeon Dr. David Shafer. ""Whether that\'s also involving some selective editing, it\'s hard to tell.""\n\nHere\'s why people online can\'t stop talking about mewing – and what you need to know about it.\n\nMewing is ""the process of placing the tongue at the roof of the mouth and applying pressure to cause bony changes in the jawline,"" says Dr. Catherine Chang, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and founder of NakedBeauty MD.\n\nWhy are people doing it? In short, because they want their jawlines to look more defined.\n\n""Basically, it\'s a way of repositioning anatomy in your neck and lower face,"" Shafer says. ""When you look in the mirror, you can practice and push your tongue up in the roof of your mouth and pull underneath your chin up to make it look slimmer. You can see a difference. When we\'re taking a picture, people consciously or subconsciously do it.""\n\nBelow is a video of how it\'s done. Though some on social media have claimed to achieve dramatic results, experts warn against believing everything you see on the internet.\n\nThe term ""mewing"" was coined by British dentist John Mew and his son, Mike Mew. They preached the idea of altering face shapes and jawlines through facial exercises, though most dentists agree in denouncing their claims – one dentist told The New York Times that Mew was ""a total idiot.""\n\nThe elder Mew, who founded the London School of Orthotropics, stepped down in 2017 after losing his license from the General Dental Council in the U.K. ""on grounds of misconduct for publicly denigrating the traditional practices of orthodontic tooth movement,"" according to the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.\n\nThe younger Mew is currently awaiting results from a General Dental Council hearing held earlier this month after treatments for 2-year-old and 6-year-old patients were deemed ""inappropriate and/or misleading,"" per hearing documents.\n\nExperts say it makes sense that everyone is thinking more about their lower face right now – ""for the last three years, we\'ve all been on Zoom,"" Shafer says, noting his office has seen a large spike in appointments for neck liposuction and chin or jaw augmentations.\n\nMewing is viewed online as a free alternative to plastic surgery or orthodontia, which can cost up to tens of thousands of dollars. But those in the industry say the results aren\'t what they\'re made up to be. And even the Mews originally intended for the treatment to focus on children, not fully-developed adults.\n\nFortunately, experts say there aren\'t any major negative side effects to mewing – ""except being disappointed,"" Chang says. ""If it\'s too good to be true, it generally is.""\n\nIf your goal is to look different while taking a single photo, mewing is a quick fix. But those hoping it can bring about the same kind of sustained change as surgery are mistaken.\n\n""If it\'s not something you\'re going to be disciplined and keep up with, then you\'re not going to see sustained or long-term results and it\'s definitely a result that will go away once you stop doing the motion,"" Shafer says. ""It\'s not something that\'s risky. It\'s not something that\'s going to cause you harm. (But) I think people need to have guarded expectations.""\n\nWhat is \'slugging,\' the viral moisturizing hack?

"Former Proud Boys leader Zachary Rehl claims the group had 'no objective' ahead of Jan. 6 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what\'s clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA former leader in the Proud Boys took the witness stand Tuesday to fight seditious conspiracy and other serious charges in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, telling jurors the group had ""no objective"" that day.\n\nZachary Rehl, who was a chapter leader from Philadelphia, became the first defendant in the high-stakes trial of five Proud Boys to testify. It\'s a potentially risky move in one of the most serious cases to emerge from the riot.\n\n""There was no objective on Jan. 6. I even asked the night before in the chat,"" Rehl, 37, testified, referring to the chat the Proud Boys used to communicate ahead of the riot. ""There were no objectives. We were just going to walk around the city. I said over and over again, I want the legal process to play out. That\'s the process our country was founded on.""\n\nRehl is on trial alongside with former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio and three others accused of plotting to forcibly stop the transfer of power from President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden.

Nor is Ethan Nordean of Auburn, Washington, or self-described Proud Boys organizer Joseph Biggs of Ormond Beach, Florida.\n\nRehl marched with other Proud Boys on Jan. 6 and entered the Capitol through a door on the west side of the building, but he testified he waited until he knew all members of Congress were out before he went inside. He said no one told him to attack the Capitol, hurt anyone or damage anything, and he didn\'t do any of those things.\n\nHe said he joined the group in 2018 to build his network as he tried to launch a business, though he acknowledged it likely had the opposite effect.

Despite his testimony, he was convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies, and is expected to be sentenced next month.\n\nBut two other Oath Keepers defendants who took the witness stand were cleared of the sedition charge.

"Beyond the podium: Thought leadership in optometry is evolving Becoming a thought leader in optometry is not an easy task, but with dedication, hard work, and a passion for the field, it is achievable. (Image credit: Adobe Stock/Kay A/peopleimages.com)\n\nA thought leader is an expert in their field who is actively engaged in promoting their ideas and sharing their knowledge with others. They are often seen as a change-maker or thought- provoking individual, and their aim is to influence and inspire others. They have a vision of what optometry is supposed to be, not what is dictated by others in the industry.\n\nIn order to become a thought leader, it is not enough to simply be an expert in your field. You must also be proactive in sharing your ideas and engaging with others. This can be done through writing articles or blogs, giving talks or presentations, or using social media. In the past thought leaders we ODs that lectured at conferences and had busy practices. With the rise of social media this has changed. Different voices are now able to be amplified. Thought leaders aren't selected by optometry magazines, pharma boards ,companies or conferences anymore. Thought leaders are created from changing the norm and utilizing the different platforms they have to provide a different perspective. Corporate ODs have been underrepresented in the past. Now is the time to seek opportunity to amplify their voice in the industry. Different voices help our industry grow.\n\nHowever, becoming a thought leader is not without its challenges. It takes time, effort, and dedication. And, once you have established yourself as a thought leader, there is a certain amount of responsibility that comes with it.\n\nAre you up for the challenge? Here are some ways ODs have become thought leaders over the last 10 years.\n\n1. Develop your expertise: To become a thought leader, you need to have in-depth knowledge and expertise in your field. This means staying up-to-date on the latest research, trends, and technologies in optometry. Attend conferences, seminars, and webinars. Read industry publications like Vision Monday and network with other professionals in the field; whether in person or on Facebook groups.\n\n2. Create a platform: Establish a platform for yourself where you can share your ideas and thoughts. This can be in the form of a blog, a podcast, or social media. Create content that is informative, engaging, and provides value to your audience. Don't be afraid of thinking outside the box and talking about things that others don't.\n\n3. Network: Networking is a crucial part of becoming a thought leader. Attend events, conferences, and seminars to connect with other professionals in the field. Meeting people face to face has a lot of meaning. You have to attend all the major conferences and add value to those conferences, whether it be cocktail hours, dinners, panel discussions, Facebook live events and podium time. Engage with others online through social media, LinkedIn groups, and forums.\n\n4. Engage with your audience: Engage with your audience by responding to comments, questions, and feedback. Start a conversation and get people talking about your ideas. Encourage debate and be open to different opinions and perspectives. Thought leaders interact with other industry professionals throughout the year, not just at conferences. When you have other ODs asking you your thoughts on topics in optometry and breaking news, you have become a Key Opinion Leader.\n\n5. Be authentic: A thought leader is not someone who pretends to know it all. Be authentic and transparent with your audience. Admit when you don't know something and be willing to learn. Optometry is an evolving profession, leaders are readers. The more you continue to learn the better you will become and continue to evolve as a thought leader.\n\n6. Seek out opportunities: Look for opportunities to speak at conferences, contribute to publications,provide content on social media and participate in webinars. Use your platform to promote your expertise and showcase your skills. Content is key! The more content you develop the more recognition you will get on the area you are looking to break into. Thought leaders seek out opportunities for exposure, it is never about the money but for the purpose.\n\n7. Be consistent: Consistency is key when it comes to building a following and establishing yourself as a thought leader. It takes time and effort to build a reputation, so be patient and keep working at it. If your competitor is providing 1 content a week look to do 3x-5x more content per week. Over time content development will become part of your routine and won't take up as much time as it did before.\n\nBecoming a thought leader in optometry is not an easy task, but with dedication, hard work, and a passion for the field, it is achievable. As you establish yourself as a leader, remember to always be humble, open to learning, and eager to share your expertise with others.\n\nThis article first appeared on Corporate Optometry's website. https://www.optometrytimes.com/view/beyond-the-podium-thought-leadership-in-optometry-is-evolving"
"Elon Musk says he wouldn't sell Twitter for the amount he paid unless a buyer would 'rigorously pursue the truth' Elon Musk says he wouldn\'t be willing to sell Twitter for $44 billion -- the price he paid for it -- unless he found someone committed to pursuing the truth.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, the billionaire was asked if he would sell the company for $44 billion, to which the billionaire answered no. He later clarified the comment, saying, ""If I was confident that they would rigorously pursue the truth, then I guess I would be glad to hand it over to someone else.""\n\nHe said: ""I don\'t care about the money really, but I do want to have some source of truth that I can count on, and I hope that\'s our aspiration with Twitter, is to have a source of truth that you can count on.""\n\nMusk is a self-proclaimed ""free-speech absolutist"" and has repeatedly criticized Twitter\'s previous content moderation decisions.\n\nSince acquiring the company in October, several banned accounts have been allowed back onto the platform, including former US president Donald Trump and rapper Kanye West, who is known as Ye. Although Musk said he had no part in bringing back Ye\'s account, the Twitter boss later removed him from the platform after Ye posted a series of antisemitic comments.\n\nEven if Musk was willing to sell the platform, Twitter may not still be worth the billions he paid for it.\n\nThe company\'s value has reportedly tanked, with Musk putting a $20 billion valuation on the company, per The Information, which cited people familiar with an email he sent to staff. The amount was less than half of what he paid for the company.\n\nRepresentatives for Twitter did not immediately respond to Insider\'s request for comment, made outside normal working hours. https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-truth-free-speech-sell-44-billion-2023-4"
"Diamondback Energy Reportedly Exploring Delaware Basin Asset Sale Diamondback Energy is reportedly exploring the sale of its Delaware Basin assets in Pecos County, Texas, according to an April 11 Bloomberg report.\n\nThe report, which quoted unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said no final decision had been made on a divestiture.\n\nSuch a sale would likely attract buyers looking to shore up Permian Basin inventory.\n\nTim Rezvan, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said ""there is validity to this news,"" given the company has upped it divestiture target earlier this year. The company increased leverage following a pair of Midland Basin acquisitions in the past year. Diamondback purchased Lario Permian LLC in 2023 for $1.55 billion and FireBird Energy LLC in 2022 for $1.75 billion.\n\nIn February, Diamondback raised its non-core asset sales target to at least $1 billion by the end of 2023-- doubling its previous $500 million target. At that time, the company had logged $750 million of completed and pending asset sales since announcing the initial target in October 2022.\n\nRELATED: Diamondback Doubles Asset Sales Target to $1B, Reveals More Midland M&A\n\nRezvan, writing in an April 11 note, said Diamondback\'s Delaware Basin assets ""are inferior to its core Midland Basin footprint, in our view, and struggle to compete for capital.""\n\n""Management\'s 2023 capital allocation (only 15% of net lateral footage is in the Delaware Basin) has reiterated that fact, and we wonder why the Delaware Basin even warrants that much capital,"" he said.\n\nDiamondback\'s Pecos wells screen well compared to the broader industry, Rezvan said.\n\n""As inventory concerns intensify among operators and oil prices remain at $80/ bbl, we expect ample industry interest for portions of Diamondback\'s  146,000 net acre Delaware Basin footprint (pro forma for pending sale), much of which is in Pecos County,"" he said.\n\nHowever, Diamondback\'s overall Delaware Basin wells underperform peer averages, leading Rezvan to argue that a capital allocation shift to the Midland Basin is warranted.\n\n""After digging into Pecos County well results from Diamondback and peers, we see that Diamondback is actually drilling stronger wells than industry peers in this part of the basin,"" Rezvan said. ""Above-average results naturally increase the attractiveness of this acreage, especially to smaller, inventory-constrained peers.""\n\nAdditional non-core asset sales by Diamondback could close the balance sheet gap with large-cap peers, Rezvan said.\n\n""The timing of this story does not seem accidental, coming on the heels of Ovintiv paying $4.3 [billion] to acquire three EnCap portfolio companies, and on the heels of the OPEC  production cut, which provides more certainty on near-term oil prices,"" Rezvan said. https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/diamondback-energy-reportedly-exploring-delaware-basin-asset-sale-204730"

"China follows in US footsteps, seeks public opinion on draft AI laws China has released a new draft regulation that it says is necessary to ensure the safe development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as Chat GPT.\n\nWhile it supports the innovative use of AI algorithms to improve user experience and access to information, the growth of such applications can lead to abuse. Emphasis should be placed on such tools and data resources to be used safely and reliably, said the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).\n\nRegulations were needed to drive a healthy and sustainable development of generative AI algorithms, said the government agency, as it published the draft laws on its website.\n\nUnder the proposed rules. operators will be required to send their applications to regulators for ""safety reviews"" before offering the services to the public, according to a report by state-owned media Global Times. They also are not to use AI algorithms and data to engage in unfair competition.\n\nThe CAC\'s draft laws further establish guidelines to which generative Ai services must adhere, such as the types of content such applications can generate. These will ensure the accuracy of information and prevent the spread of false information, the regulator said.\n\nThe draft laws are open for public feedback until May 10.\n\nThe move comes a day after the US government said it was seeking public input on AI accountability. The US Department of Commerce\'s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) said the feedback would guide policies that support AI audits, risk and safety assessments, certifications, and tools to establish trust in AI systems.\n\n""Responsible AI systems could bring enormous benefits, but only if we address their potential consequences and harms. For these systems to reach their full potential, companies and consumers need to be able to trust them,"" said NTIA\'s administrator Alan Davidson.\n\nSubmissions for feedback to the NTIA will close on June 10.\n\nEfforts from China and the US to gain some control come as interest in generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT, continues to grow. Key players from both markets including the likes of Tencent, Alibaba, Google, and Microsoft are offering or integrating the AI model into their products.\n\nAlibaba Cloud just yesterday unveiled its large language AI platform, called Tongyi Qianwen, which currently is available to customers in China for beta testing and as an API to developers. The AI model also will be integrated with Alibaba\'s enterprise applications and tapped to power its products and services, including its online collaboration workplace platform DingTalk as well as smart voice assistant, Tmall Genie. https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-follows-in-us-footsteps-seeks-public-opinion-on-draft-ai-laws/#ftag=RSSbaffb68"
"Lakers overcome Anthony Davis' 'brain fart,' defeat Timberwolves in OT to secure No. 7 seed The Los Angeles Lakers\' rally against the Minnesota Timberwolves in Tuesday night\'s play-in game was nearly wasted thanks to Anthony Davis\' blunder on the final play of regulation.\n\nDennis Schröder appeared to have secured the victory for the Lakers when he took LeBron James\' pass and hit a tie-breaking 3-pointer with just 1.1 seconds to go. But Davis fouled Mike Conley on a 3-point attempt with just .1 second showing on the clock and the Timberwolves veteran knocked down all three free throws to force overtime.\n\nThankfully for Davis, the Lakers controlled overtime and won 108-102 to secure the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. He and his teammates were able to have a laugh about his error after the game.\n\nWalking through the final sequence of regulation in his on-court interview with TNT, James teased Davis, saying ""it\'s unfortunate that AD had a brain fart and messed (Schröder\'s) game-winner up.""\n\nDavis came over to offer up a public apology to Schröder. ""I messed his game-winner up, I apologize. I definitely apologize,"" Davis said.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nJames had 30 points and 10 rebounds and Schröder scored 21 points and iced the win with two free throws with 8.4 seconds left in OT. Davis had 24 points and 15 rebounds. The Lakers rallied from a 15-point deficit in the second half, limiting the Timberwolves to just 12 points in the fourth quarter and four in overtime.\n\nThe Lakers will play the No. 2 seed Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n""This is what our sport is all about, getting to April and having an opportunity to play in the postseason,"" James said. ""We\'ve been battle-tested all year. Especially since the (All-Star) break we\'ve played some really good basketball. That\'s a good-ass team over there in Minnesota no matter who they had in the lineup.""\n\nMissing for Minnesota was Rudy Gobert, who was suspended for Tuesday\'s play-in game by the team after he punched teammate Kyle Anderson during the Timberwolves\' regular-season finale, and Jaden McDaniels, who is out indefinitely with a broken hand after he punched a wall in frustration Sunday. The Timberwolves play the winner of the New Orleans Pelicans-Oklahoma City Thunder play-in game on Friday in Minneapolis.

"Staycation for the win? Vacation home sales are down 50% from pre-pandemic levels The hottest segment of the pandemic\'s once scorching housing market is going cold.\n\nThe trend of high demand for vacation homes led by a rise in remote work and low mortgage rates has reversed, according to a new Redfin report.\n\nMortgage-rate locks for second homes were down 52% from pre-pandemic levels on a seasonally adjusted basis in March, compared with a 13% decline for primary homes. Second-home rate locks fell to their lowest level since 2016 in February and remained nearly as low in March.\n\nThis stands in contrast to what was happening in 2020 when the pandemic drove intense demand for second homes as well-to-do buyers tapped historically low mortgage costs and higher savings rates.\n\nReal estate:Commercial real estate is headed for a crisis worse than 2008, Morgan Stanley analysts say\n\nHousing:How Hispanic homeownership became a \'driving force\' shaping the housing market\'s future\n\nMigration:Manhattan population grows as other major New York counties see a decline\n\nSales of existing homes in counties with at least a 20% share of vacation homes rose by 24% on average in 2020, more than double the 11% increase in counties that don\'t have a large volume of vacation homes, according to a 2021 National Association of Realtors report.\n\nVacation home sales rose by nearly 17% in 2020 and by 33% year-over-year between January and April 2021.\n\n""Now there\'s been a huge reversal because of high interest rates and also because of the general economy,"" says Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. ""People are worried about a recession and during a recession, the first thing that tends to get cut are more frivolous items like second homes.""\n\nMortgage-rate locks for second homes reached a peak of 89% above pre-pandemic levels (defined as average of January and February of 2020) in August 2020.\n\nCompared to August 2020, when second home mortgage-rate locks reached a peak, March rate locks were down by 75%.\n\nThis coincides with the average rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage dropping below 3% in July 2020. In the middle of March of this year, mortgage rates hovered around 6.6%.\n\nThe analysis does not include cash purchases.\n\nCash buyers are still looking for vacation condos, especially in desirable neighborhoods, says Phoenix Redfin agent Van Welborn.\n\n""It\'s mostly affluent cash buyers who don\'t have to worry about high rates,"" Welborn said. ""They\'re motivated to buy now because they think they can get a vacation home for under asking price.""\n\nSecond-home demand is also down from a year ago and from January 2022, just before mortgage rates started rising from record lows. Mortgage-rate locks for second homes were down 49% year over year in March and down 71% from January 2022. Mortgage-rate locks for primary homes have dropped 29% year over year and 35% since January 2022.\n\nOptions for remote work have begun to dwindle – and with that reduced the opportunity to spend more time in the second home, making them less attractive.\n\nIn March 2022, remote-focused listings accounted for more than 20% of all paid job postings, a huge jump from less than 10% in January 2021.\n\nBut that spike has given way to an abrupt decline, according to LinkedIn. In November 2022, jus about 14% of paid job postings on LinkedIn invited remote applicants.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a housing and economy correspondent for USA TODAY.

"Federal workers feel less engaged in their jobs for the 2nd year in a row: 'It's heading in the wrong direction' The nation\'s civil workers feel less engaged at their jobs for the second year in a row, with the lowest levels recorded among younger employees who could one day become top agency leaders, according to a new report released Wednesday by the nonpartisan nonprofit Partnership for Public Service.\n\nThe 2022 Best Places to Work in the Federal Government report, based on surveys of more than 880,000 workers across 506 federal agencies and subcomponents, found an average employee engagement score of 63.4 out of 100 -- a 1.1-point decrease from 2021 and the second consecutive annual downtick. Insider obtained an early copy of the report.\n\nThe average is concerning, and a sign that the Biden administration must do more to boost employee morale and create better work environments, said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service.\n\n""It is not a good number,"" Stier said. ""And two years declining is a problem. It\'s low to start with and it\'s heading in the wrong direction.""\n\nAmong the 17 large federal agencies, employees at the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration recorded the lowest engagement scores, each in the 50s.\n\nAt the top of the list, NASA ranked first for the 11th year based on an engagement score of 84.3, followed by the Department of Health and Human Services at 74.3, and the slew of agencies that make up the Intelligence Community at 71.9.\n\n""What the federal government offers is extraordinary mission commitment,"" Stier said. ""Whether they\'re at NASA and they care about space, or they\'re at the Department of Homeland Security and they care about keeping us safe from domestic attacks, they\'re in each of their agencies because they care about mission, but what they aren\'t getting is the best leadership that enables them to perform their jobs in the best way possible.""\n\nThe decline in employee engagement came as the federal government was still grappling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, new remote and return-to-work policies, rising inflation, as well as the rollout of major legislative policies, such as the bipartisan infrastructure package, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS Act.\n\n""There\'s all kinds of more demand being put on these federal employees. That said, good leaders were able to improve engagement,"" Stier said. ""It should not be one or the other. In fact, over the longer term, focusing on the employee engagement will actually improve the chances of better delivery of all these services.""\n\nThe ""big message"" is that the Biden administration needs to prioritize their employees\' well-being as ""it\'s fundamental to keeping the promises that they\'ve made,"" Stier said.\n\nThe issue is particularly worrisome, Stier said, for younger federal workers aged 30 to 39, who reported the lowest engagement and satisfaction score of 59.5. By comparison, workers aged 60 and over registered the highest average at 71.6, according to the report.\n\nThe data revealed that ""many younger workers value more the ability to have more say and control over what it is that they\'re doing in the way that they\'re doing it,"" Stier said, adding that agency leaders should pay attention to the group and their needs.\n\nA new category in the annual survey, which started in 2003, was to rank how agencies are meeting employee needs in diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. White employees recorded a score of 72.6, which was 4.4 points more than what people of color reported.

"Game on with the Samsung Odyssey Ark curved gaming monitor--now $700 off -- Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed\'s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nIf you love a marathon gaming session, you know the importance of a quality gaming monitor to keep up with all the action. We support our fellow gamers and that\'s why this Samsung deal is so good. Our editors love the Samsung Odyssey Ark curved monitor for intense game play, cinematic movie experiences and even easier workflow. Right now, you can save big on this rotating monitor at Samsung.\n\nDown from its regular price of $2,999.99, you can pick up the top-rated monitor for $2,299.99 today. That is a savings of $700 for one of the coolest gaming monitors out there. One of our editors, Jaime Carillo, raves about his Samsung monitor saying, ""What truly sets Samsung Odyssey Ark apart from other monitors on the market is the freedom you get when arranging your screen. Samsung Ark\'s Multi View lets you display four different screens simultaneously instead of bouncing from monitor to monitor.""\n\n Deals and discounts: Take your listening to new heights with these Samsung earbuds--save up to $115 now\n\nWe ranked a similar monitor from the Samsung Odyssey line as one of the best gaming monitors, loving the same immersive 1000R curve and ""sleek and futuristic look"" you\'ll find in this model. The Samsung Odyssey Ark 4K boasts a solid 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time for fast reactions as you play intense games and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. Like the model we love, it has Quantum Mini-LED technology to deliver depth in picture, combined with Dolby Atmos and Sound Dome technology for immersive surround sound with compatible gear. Use the included wireless dial controller to adjust settings comfortably and with ease.\n\nWe gave this Samsung gaming monitor our stamp of approval when it launched at CES 2022, calling it ""everything we love about CES."" We praised its combination of productivity and ""pure fun."" The coolest feature, though, is its flexibility: the monitor can seamlessly rotate between landscape and portrait orientation, and tilt and adjust by height for the perfect set up.\n\nIf you need an SSD to match this powerful monitor that is fast enough for quick file transfers and games that can be used on your PlayStation 5 and PC, Jonathan Hilburg, our electronics and gaming editor, suggests the Samsung 980 PRO NVMe drive. ""While you might not notice an immediate difference in games when you bump up your storage speed, it can help reduce load times. The slightly slower Samsung 970 EVO Plus is a great choice for most people if you\'re looking to save some money, but isn\'t compatible with the PS5.""\n\nWhen it comes to Samsung monitor deals, this one is a big winner. Whether you\'re ready to leap into a world of more immersive gaming or simply upgrade your office monitor to something sleeker, this deal is one you won\'t want to miss.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

"Where to watch Real Madrid vs. Chelsea live stream for free online When you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more.\n\nWe saw some great games in the first round of the Champions League quarter-finals last night, and we're hoping this one will be packed with goals too. Don't miss out; take a look at our guide on where to watch a Real Madrid vs. Chelsea live stream for free. Our guide gives you local options in the US, UK, Canada, and Austria and how to tune in from anywhere with a VPN.\n\nIt's super simple this season with just the one streaming service in the US, Paramount Plus, required for all Champions League matches from the group stages to the final. Better yet, you don't have to opt for the Premium tier as Paramount Plus includes Champions League coverage on the cheap $5 a month Essentials plan. You can start with a 7-day free trial and even watch the game for free. Kickoff is at 3 p.m. ET / 12 p.m. PT, and you can also see the game on CBS if you have it.\n\nParamount Plus offers tons of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. There's a 7-day free trial, then the Essential plan is $4.99 a month or $49.99 a year. It doesn't include live CBS streaming, but live Champions League coverage is included.\n\nA VPN is the best way to get around geo-restrictions and is a viable option for today's game. Suppose you have a subscription to the US version of Paramount Plus but are currently overseas. In that case, a VPN lets your device appear to be in a different country and offers excellent privacy options at home or on public Wi-Fi for your phone, laptop, streaming devices, and more. Another option is using the VPN to tune into the Austrian TV channel online, ServusTV, as you can enjoy the game for free. No English commentary, of course, but free is free.\n\nOur preferred option of all the best VPN providers is ExpressVPN, which comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're unsatisfied. Check out the latest deal details below.\n\nWith its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that makes it exceptional. Better yet, you can save up to 49% and get an extra three months for free today.\n\nSoccer fans in Canada will need to stump up some extra cash to enjoy a Champions League live stream of Real Madrid vs. Chelsea tonight, as DAZN Canada holds the local viewing rights. Fortunately, DAZN is packed with sports, with many European tournaments and various English soccer leagues, NFL Game Pass, LIV Golf, WTA, and more. You can sign up for $25 monthly or go all-in on a one-year deal for $199. The game will kickoff off at 3 p.m. ET / 12 p.m. PT.\n\nAs has been standard for the last few years, BT Sport is your only option for catching the Champions League in the UK. However, unlike the early days of BT's reign, you don't have to sign up for a lengthy TV/broadband bundle to get access as a BT Sport monthly pass is now available on a rolling one-month deal for £30. Check out BT's package deals if you are after a larger bundle with a longer commitment (but lower monthly prices). We'd opt for the monthly pass if you're mainly getting this for football, as there are only a few months left of the season - you can always pick it up again after the barren summer months. Kickoff is set for 8 p.m. tonight.\n\nThere are two free options available today. First up, If you're in the US, Paramount Plus is currently running a free 7-day free trial. So you can absolutely enjoy a free live stream of the game. As with most streaming free trials, you must enter payment details, but cancel before the seven days are up, and you won't get charged. That's plenty of time to give the rest of the app a good look, just in case you fancy keeping it. You can opt for the Essential or Premium tier trials; both come with Champions League live streaming.\n\nAnother option to watch Real Madrid vs. Chelsea for free online is to tune into the Austrian channel, ServusTV, as it's showing a live stream free of charge. You will need to use a VPN to simulate your device's location to be in Austria though.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs. https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/streaming/where-to-watch-real-madrid-vs-chelsea-live-stream-free-2023-4"

CAT Labs is building digital asset recovery and cybersecurity tools to enable governments to fight crypto crime. CAT Labs\' digital asset recovery tool specializes in finding, identifying, analyzing, and seizing digital assets in criminal cases, allowing US government agencies, state, and local police departments, as well as US-allied countries, to accurately and efficiently process digital assets involved in criminal investigations.\n\nThe explosion of crypto-targeted crimes is the biggest threat to the Web3 and DeFi revolution\n\n""The explosion of crypto-targeted crimes like hacks, scams, and fraud is the biggest threat to the Web3 and DeFi revolution,"" said Lili Infante, Founder at CAT Labs ""We at CAT Labs see the incredible potential of distributed ledger technology as the future of the digital world.

At RW3 Ventures, we believe that a thriving crypto economy depends on Law Enforcement having the necessary tools to protect market integrity,"" said Pete Najarian, Managing Partner at RW3 Ventures.

We are thrilled to partner with the CAT Labs team on this journey.""\n\nColleen Sullivan, Co-Head Venture Brevan Howard Digital said, ""Illicit transactions involving cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $20.1 billion in 2022, which was also a year during which the industry experienced an unprecedented cascade of bankruptcies and fraudulent activities. In order for the crypto ecosystem to thrive and grow, first and foremost, it must be a safe place for participants. We have a strong investment thesis to back exceptional founders building products and services in the crypto industry to better equip the public and private sector to detect and catch criminals and to better protect their internal systems from theft. Lili Infante, who previously spent 10 years at the US Department of Justice as a special agent and founded a DOJ task force focused on shutting down illegal networks using cryptocurrencies, is the ideal entrepreneur to bring these products and services to the market and we are thrilled to support her and the entire CAT Labs team.""\n\nCAT Labs is building digital asset recovery and cybersecurity tools to enable governments to fight crypto crime and to protect investors from hacks, fraud, and scams.

"LadBible owner claims it is the 'number one' news publisher on TikTok The group behind LadBible has shrugged off a disappointing financial performance with claims it is has become the 'number one' news publisher on TikTok.\n\nLBG Media told investors on Wednesday its TikTok follower numbers grew by 72 per cent in the year to 31 December, when compared against the previous year.\n\nIts global audience grew by 39 per cent year-on-year to 366million, with 98billion content views in the period, up 56 per cent year-on-year, according to the company.\n\nFollowers: LBG Media, the group behind LadBible, has claimed it is now the 'number one' news publisher on TikTok\n\nBut pre-tax profits sank 10 per cent to £7.3million over the period, as revenues growth of 15 per cent to £62.8million missed forecasts. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was down six per cent at £15.7million.\n\nLBG said: 'Whilst we acknowledge that the Group did not achieve its initial revenue and profit targets for 2022, we are pleased with our robust performance given the rapidly changing macro-economic issues affecting the UK and international markets during the year.'\n\nLBG Group shares sank 3.9 per cent by midday on Wednesday to around 74p.\n\nThe Manchester-based media group made 43 staff redundant in the second half in a bid to cut costs, but opened a new office in New York in efforts to expand in the US 'with content for the local audience'.\n\nLBG also said its acquisition of the social pages of Go Animals, which it rebranded to Furry Tails, saw solid growth in 2022.\n\nIt is yet to deploy the £30million it raised via an initial public offering, which it said gives the group 'significant firepower for both acquisitions and organic growth opportunities'.\n\nOn dividends, the group, said: 'The Board understands the importance of dividends to many shareholders, but given the high-growth nature of the Group, the Directors plan to reinvest much of the Group's earnings to facilitate this growth. The Board will consider a progressive dividend policy at the appropriate time.'\n\nBoss Solly Solomou added: 'We have made continued financial and operational progress in 2022. H2 was particularly strong, delivered amid a challenging backdrop, with both our core revenue streams demonstrating the resilient nature of our business.\n\n'LBG is well positioned to capitalise on the fast-growing digital media market. We have a diverse range of brands catering to the hard to reach 18–34-year-old demographic, have expanded our capabilities, with our survey platform LADnation forming an increasingly key part of our offer, and we are taking advantage of the significant growth opportunity that the US market has to offer.\n\n'We ended 2022 with a great deal of positive momentum, as evidenced by our record direct revenue performance for Q4, and with this momentum continuing into 2023 I am excited by what lies ahead for the business.'\n\nFiona Orford-Williams, director at Edison Group, said: 'After a difficult opening to last year, LBG had a much better second half, with particularly good momentum in Q4, which has reportedly continued into the new year.\n\n'The good Q4 was partly natural seasonality, part helped by the FIFA World Cup and part from the repositioning of the group further towards short-form video (with particular success on TikTok) and a more diversified content base - all still focused on younger audiences.'\n\nShe added: 'The big prize for LBG will depend on its success in building up its US presence. It is still early days here, but the first signs are encouraging and the group has the experience of building its brands in Australia and Ireland. The group still has much of the cash that it raised on listing in late 2021, so has the resource to continue to invest and buy where appropriate.'\n\nAnalysts at Peel Hunt, said: 'The shares are down 40 per cent YTD, and trading on 12x FY23E PE. We believe they continue to look cheap and see scope for outperformance as the year progresses given the traction in short form. We maintain our Buy. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-11964213/LadBible-owner-claims-number-one-news-publisher-TikTok.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

"MilkMate, a Revolutionary Breast Pumping Solution for the Workplace, Receives FDA Market Clearance and Closes $5M Series Seed Funding Round NEW YORK, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- MilkMate Products, Inc. (www.milkmate.com), the Manhattan-based company on a mission to support and empower working moms and the employers who support them, announced that its breast pump and parts for its new turnkey breast pumping solution, designed specifically for workplace wellness rooms, have received market clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The MilkMate solution is currently entering a soft launch phase with a select few early adopter customers before its formal launch to the greater Manhattan market this upcoming summer.\n\nMilkMate was created on the belief that today\'s working moms should never have to choose between family and a professional career because of the challenges related to breast pumping in the workplace. The MilkMate breast pumping solution is comprised of modular furniture components that include a built-in multi-user breast pump and single-use parts that come pre-assembled and pre-sterilized, ready for immediate use. The solution is easily adaptable to any existing office space or wellness room and helps employers meet regulatory requirements such as those most recently brought forth by the PUMP Act in December 2022. With MilkMate, working moms are required to bring nothing with them to work – saving employees time from having to clean, pack up and transport pump gear to and from work.\n\nIn addition to securing FDA clearance on its breast pump and parts, MilkMate is pleased to announce a successful close of its Series Seed fundraise round of $5 million.\n\n""MilkMate is designed to support both working moms and their employers by offering a more streamlined way for employees to breast pump at work following maternity leave,"" said Patrice Meagher, Founder and CEO of MilkMate. ""As a parent of 4, breast pumping at the office was by far the most inefficient thing I did as a working mom. I knew there had to be a better way and that\'s why I created the MilkMate solution. We are thrilled to receive FDA market clearance and announce the close of our $5M Series Seed round. Both are huge milestones that will enable us to officially launch this much needed solution for employers and working moms everywhere.""\n\nFor both working moms returning from maternity leave and prospective employers looking for the right solution to address the current challenges surrounding breast pumping in the workplace, please visit www.milkmate.com.\n\nFollow us on: Instagram and LinkedIn\n\nSOURCE MilkMate Inc. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/milkmate-a-revolutionary-breast-pumping-solution-for-the-workplace-receives-fda-market-clearance-and-closes-5m-series-seed-funding-round-301795275.html"

"Third floor collapses at federal courthouse in Savannah; three workers injured SAVANNAH, Ga. -- An upper-floor collapse inside Savannah's 124-year-old federal courthouse injured three workers on Tuesday, officials said.\n\nEveryone else inside the Tomochichi Federal Building and United States Courthouse was accounted for and not injured, Savannah Fire battalion chief Wayne Ifill said.\n\nAll three workers were taken to the hospital. The injuries were not critical, the Savannah Fire Department confirmed.\n\nThe workers were working on the third floor of the courthouse when part of that floor fell onto the second floor, Ifill said. The building will be shut down until the structural engineer arrives from South Carolina to determine when it is safe to re-enter, Ifill said.\n\nNATIONAL FORECAST:Warmer temperatures spread across the country; melting snow causes flooding concerns\n\nLOUISVILLE UPDATES:Body camera video shows officers fired at in gunman's 'ambush'\n\nThe construction at the courthouse site has been a disruption for neighboring businesses in Savannah for months.\n\nAltered traffic patterns along with lack of communication have frustrated businesses who rely on foot traffic and visitors coming through the area. The federal contract to renovate the courthouse was supposed to take a year. Now, more than a year after construction began, it's estimated to be completed in 2024.\n\nSince the construction began, several streets have been blocked off. Subcontractor vehicles also take up parking spaces.\n\nThe building is in the middle of a $75 million renovation scheduled for completion next year and has been essentially gutted on the inside, Ifill said.\n\nThe Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse opened in 1899 on Wright Square in the heart of Savannah's downtown historic district. More than a century later, it was named for the chief of the Yamacraw people, a small band of Native Americans who lived in the region.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

"The Battle Over Abortion Drugs The treatment has become more popular partly because many women prefer it to surgical abortion. They can take the drugs at home rather than at a hospital or doctor\'s office, and the drugs are both highly effective and safe. Emergency rooms see more people suffering side effects from Tylenol, Christina Jewett, who covers the F.D.A. for The Times, pointed out.\n\n""This drug has been studied and scrutinized heavily for more than 20 years,"" Christina told me. (This graphical review of the evidence is illuminating.)\n\nSince the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade last year, 13 states have banned nearly all abortions, including medication abortions. But some women in those states have been able to get around the bans with a drug prescription. They can briefly travel to another state to receive the pills or can order them by mail (even illegally from an overseas provider, as some abortion-rights advocates have encouraged).\n\nThe rise of medication abortion explains why overall abortion rates have not declined as much post-Roe as some people expected. Nationwide, the number of legal abortions per month was 7 percent lower in the final three months of last year than in the months immediately before the Supreme Court ruling, according to a report issued yesterday by the Society of Family Planning. Because the data does not include illegal abortions, the actual decline was likely smaller, my colleague Margot Sanger-Katz said.\n\nBoth abortion supporters and opponents understand how important medication abortion has become. ""The fact that pills can be mailed is an existential crisis for the anti-abortion movement,"" Rachel Rebouché, the dean of Temple University\'s law school, told The Associated Press. ""It\'s hard to police. It\'s hard to track. It\'s difficult to enforce. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/briefing/abortion-drugs.html"

"Ocean's rise takes a surprising turn 04/11/2023 06:00 PM EDT\n\nLifeguard Michael Vasta\'s stand is in danger of being swept out to sea in Dania Beach, Fla.   Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nSea levels across the Southeastern United States are rising three times faster than the global average.\n\nThat\'s according to a new study from the journal Nature Communications, writes POLITICO\'s E&E News reporter Chelsea Harvey. Another study published earlier this month in the Journal of Climate found a similar pattern.\n\nThe findings suggest that communities along the U.S. Gulf and Southeastern coastlines, from Houston to New Orleans and Miami to Cape Hatteras, N.C., could be at even greater risk from rising tides than scientists had predicted.\n\nIn recent years, the already vulnerable landscape has seen increased flooding, more severe hurricanes and eroding shorelines that once provided protection from storm surges. Millions of Americans are watching their shorelines not-so-gradually slip into the ocean as flood damages rise and insurance costs spike.\n\nThe science: Human-caused global warming -- primarily from burning fossil fuels -- is driving sea-level rise worldwide. But the disproportionate rate in the southeastern U.S. is somewhat of a mystery. Scientists agree that physical ocean dynamics are likely to blame, but the nature of those dynamics is less clear.\n\nResearchers thought perhaps the tidal rises were exacerbated by sinking land, a notable problem in parts of Texas and Louisiana. But they found no real connection between sea-level rise and sinking land in the region.\n\nMeltwater from the world\'s shrinking glaciers and ice sheets has contributed to a global acceleration in sea-level rise -- but it doesn\'t fully explain the pattern happening on U.S. coastlines.\n\nSome researchers suggest that warming waters and changing wind patterns have altered the ocean\'s circulation in parts of the North Atlantic and the Caribbean, changing the way masses of water flow up to U.S. coastlines. Others say perhaps the increase is being driven by changes in a warm-water current passing through the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe upshot: Researchers say the accelerated sea-level rise could slow back down eventually, but no one knows if that\'s probable or how long it might take -- adding another uncertainty to the consequences of a warming planet.\n\nIt\'s Tuesday -- thank you for tuning in to POLITICO\'s Power Switch.

That amount of water could provide 6.2 million families with water for one year.\n\nBy declining to indicate a ""preferred alternative,"" President Joe Biden\'s Interior Department is seeking to turn up the pressure on the states to accelerate their negotiations to strike a water-sharing deal that could alleviate the need for Interior Department to make the tough decisions, writes Annie Snider.\n\nTesla cars recharge at a charging station in Corte Madera, Calif.

"5 things the Supreme Court might take into account in medication abortion case  As the Supreme Court prepares for yet another controversial abortion case to come its way, the justices will pore over District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk\'s ruling last week to block the government\'s approval of the key medication abortion drug at issue.\n\nHere are five issues that could attract the attention of the high court:\n\nPesky threshold issues\n\nCourt watchers like to jump right to the heart of a dispute to consider ""the merits"" of a particular controversy.\n\nTheir first step is always to determine whether a case is properly before the court. Is it a true ""case or controversy"" as required under the law? Here, the plaintiffs – physicians and organizations opposed to abortion that are representing physicians – say the FDA should have never approved the drug more than 20 years ago. But can those plaintiffs show that they have the legal injury necessary to bring the case? Kacsmaryk, of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, said they could.\n\n""Here, the associations\' members have standing because they allege adverse events from chemical abortion drugs can overwhelm the medical system and place enormous pressure and stress on doctors during emergencies and complications,"" he wrote.\n\nBut others question whether that amounts to the ""concrete and particularized"" injury the plaintiffs need to get in the courthouse door.\n\n""Vague speculation that someday, somewhere, some unspecified doctor will be overwhelmed by an onslaught of patients coming into the ER after taking mifepristone does not establish that these particular doctors face an imminent risk of a concrete and particularized harm,"" Adam Unikowsky, a lawyer and former clerk of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, wrote in his newsletter.\n\nAs for the Biden administration, it told the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that ""plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA\'s approval of a drug they neither take nor prescribe; their challenge to FDA actions dating back to 2000 is manifestly untimely; and they have provided no basis for second-guessing FDA\'s scientific judgment.""\n\nThe justices care about these issues, because they impact far more than just the case at hand.\n\n""These questions of whether the plaintiffs have the kind of real-world injury that is necessary to get into court, and whether their claim was timely or filed too late apply across the board in federal lawsuits,"" said Supreme Court litigator Andrew Pincus.\n\n""There are serious questions on whether the Supreme Court is willing to endorse the district\'s court\'s very broad approach to those questions,"" he said.\n\nIs this a case about abortion?\n\nSome of the members of the high court could see this case as less about abortion, and more about the authority of a federal agency to assess public health and the regulatory landscape in general.\n\n""The current conservative majority has generally been very skeptical of how much authority various agencies exercise,"" said CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck who is a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. ""The one place where they have been less skeptical though, has been an agency\'s authority, which is predicated on long settled and well developed technical and scientific expertise"" he added.\n\nBack in January 2021, Chief Justice John Roberts discussed the FDA\'s authority in a case related to medication abortion and said, ""My view is that courts owe significant deference to the politically accountable entities with the background, competence and expertise to assess public health.""\n\nIn addition, leaders of pharmaceutical and biotech companies condemned Kacsmaryk\'s opinion in a sign that they are worried it could impact other drugs and destabilize the regulatory landscape. Those arguments won\'t be lost on the justices.\n\n""As an industry we count on the FDA\'s autonomy and authority to bring new medicines to patients under a reliable regulatory process for drug evaluation and approval,"" the companies wrote in a statement released Monday. ""Adding regulatory uncertainty to the already inherently risky work of discovering and developing new medicines will likely have the effect of reducing incentives for investment, endangering the innovation that characterizes our industry,"" they said.\n\nBut lawyers for the anti-abortion doctors behind the challenge said in court filings Tuesday that the FDA had broken the rules. They said the district court order ""paints an alarming picture of decades-long agency lawlessness -- all to the detriment of the women and girls FDA is charged to protect.""\n\nRemember the Dobbs opinion?\n\nAs he often does, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately last June to explain his thinking in voting to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n""To be clear, then,"" he wrote ""the Court\'s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States,"" he said. ""On the contrary, the Court\'s decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process,"" he added.\n\nFor his part, Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, announced that, ""The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.""\n\nBut Kacsmaryk\'s decision, if allowed to go into effect, would severely cut back on abortion even in states that allow it. In addition, in its filing brief, the Justice Department also emphasized that mifepristone is used for other purposes besides abortion.\n\n""This harm would be felt throughout the country, given that mifepristone has lawful uses in every state,"" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court might also take issue with the relief that Kacsmaryk ordered. He decided he had the authority to bypass the agency, and vacate the approvals directly. Had he, instead, issued an injunction against the FDA, the move could have allowed the agency to work in a more timely manner to implement the decision.\n\nLooking at the language\n\nOn page two of his opinion, Kacsmaryk criticizes jurists who use the word ""fetus"" to ""inaccurately identify unborn humans in unscientific ways.""\n\nBut who are some jurists who have decided to use the word ""fetus"" when discussing abortion?\n\nNone other than the liberals on the Supreme Court who dissented in Dobbs.\n\nKacsmaryk chooses, instead, to use the word ""unborn human."" He also refers to medication abortion as ""chemical abortion"" – a term favored by opponents of abortion rights.\n\nAt other times his language is graphic. When Kacsmaryk explains the effects of mifepristone, he writes that it ""halts nutrition, and ultimately starves the unborn human until death.""\n\nThe judge also utilizes the word ""abortionist"" when referring to health care officials who perform the procedures.\n\nCritics of Kacsmaryk also fear his opinion could confuse patients. Dr. Courtney Schreiber noted in a sworn declaration filed Monday that many patients will believe that abortion is no longer legal if his ruling goes into effect Friday. Some facilities may offer just misoprostol, the doctor noted, a second drug that usually works in concert with mifepristone.\n\n""Restricted access to this safe therapeutic threatens the health of real people – people who are mothers, sisters, daughters, wives and friends,"" she wrote.\n\nScience and junk science\n\nAnother doctor who filed a declaration in favor of a stay is Dr. Alisa Goldberg, who serves at Harvard Medical School and works at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston. She testified that after more than two decades of treating patients with medication abortion, ""the tiny proportion of patients who experience serious complications from taking mifepristone has remained consistently flat.""\n\nBut Kacsmaryk openly rejects such language. He contends that the agency didn\'t do enough more than 20 years ago to test the drug – defying all that major medical associations have said about the efficacy of the drug. Alliance Defending Freedom, the group representing the plaintiffs in the case, praised Karcsmaryk\'s ruling on Monday, insisting on calling the drug ""dangerous."" Erin Hawley, a lawyer for the group, said that the FDA ""put women in harm\'s way, and the agency should be held accountable for its reckless actions.""\n\nAnd in a court filing Tuesday, she called the opinion ""meticulously considered.""\n\nOthers contend Kacsmaryk abandoned his role as a judge in favor of passing himself off as a health expert. They point to a part of his decision quoting ""one study"" where 14% of women and girls reported having received ""insufficient information"" on issues on the burdens and risks of the procedure. But the study, is culled from an anti-abortion rights website and is made up of stories from those who had abortions and wish to share their experience anonymously.\n\n""Okay, so to recap the judge asserts that \'fourteen percent of women and girls report having received insufficient information\' without revealing the entire sample consists of anonymous blog posts on pro-life website designed for women who regret their abortions,"" Unikowsky wrote.\n\nAnd the judge cites a study about women who have had abortions feeling ""shame, regret, anxiety and depression"" without mentioning other studies holding the opposite. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/supreme-court-medication-abortion-considerations/index.html"
"Over 2,000 people evacuated after fire in Richmond, Indiana; blaze caused by burning tractor-trailer A large industrial fire at a facility in Richmond, Indiana, storing plastics and other recyclables caused officials to order an evacuation Tuesday of nearby areas.\n\nThe fire, northwest of Richmond\'s downtown area, sent thick, choking clouds of black smoke high enough into the atmosphere that they were visible on satellite radar.\n\n""Evacuation orders for residents and persons within 0.5 miles of the incident have been issued.

""Buses are being utilized to evacuate residents who need it.""\n\nSnow said the inferno at the facility was caused after a tractor-trailer truck caught fire and the blaze spread to the nearby building, which was storing plastic and other recycled materials.\n\nOfficials have said the smoke is toxic to breathe.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) were on site and evaluating any potential hazards resulting from the fire, Snow said.\n\n""We know there are toxic entities when you burn plastics and other types of materials like this,"" Snow said.

"Cyclone in Western Australia weighs on Capesize freight rates; threatens cargo loadings The intensification of Tropical Cyclone Ilsa into a Category 4 storm off the coast of Western Australia has kept market participants in watchful mode as shipping schedules and loading operations risk facing delays.\n\nReceive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\n\nSources said the uncertainty of the impact of this tropical cyclone may weigh on Pacific freight rates and could see more ships ballasting towards the Atlantic basin.\n\nAll berths at Port Hedland in Western Australia were required to be cleared by 13:00 local time on April 12, and all trading vessels should be clear of the port limits by 18:00 on the same day, according to shipping agency sources. There were 10 Capesize vessels at Port Hedland as of April 12, according to Platts cFlow ship and commodity tracking software from S&P Global Commodity Insights, with 131 vessels expected to arrive over the next two weeks.\n\n""Freight rates on the [Western Australia to China iron ore route] did come off on April 11 with the last fixed at $7.95/wmt,"" said a shipbroker source. There were shippers who usually move iron ore cargoes from Port Hedland previously in the market but did not fix any vessels following a reshuffling in their schedules on April 11, the source said.\n\nPlatts, part of S&P Global, assessed freight for a Capesize ship to move 170,000 mt (plus/minus 10%) of iron ore from Port Hedland to Qingdao at $8/wmt April 11, down 50 cents/wmt from April 10.\n\n""There are a whole lot of variables [to consider] as the port [Port Hedland] would likely be closed for two to three days, and there would be the scheduling perspective [in the short term] but [the impact of the fallout] could be more lasting if it were the mine, rail or inland logistics that are being affected,"" a second shipbroker source said. If that comes to fruition, that could hurt shipping demand, the source said.\n\nA chartering source with an iron ore miner noted that the port was still operating on April 12, and following the clear out of vessels, there will likely be some waiting until the storm passes. Shipping sources agreed that Western Australia to China freight rates were under some pressure from fears of demand and schedule disruptions.\n\nPort Hedland shipped 556.6 million mt of cargo in 2022, the largest in terms of volumes out of Australia and the majority of which went on Capesize ships, according to S&P Global data.\n\nMarket sources said tonnage in the Pacific appeared to be stacking up and the lack of cargoes from Port Hedland was leading some shipowners and operators to consider alternatives such as coal voyages from the east coast of Australia or ballasting towards Brazil. ""It\'s a wait and see for now but with [Brazil to China] freight rates paying better, I feel more owners may choose to ballast,"" said a third shipbroker source.\n\nSome market participants said they felt that the impact of the storm may be contained as information from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology showed that Tropical Cyclone IIsa is forecast to make landfall between Port Hedland and Broome rather than Port Hedland itself. ""Port Hedland would be shut for these two days, but Port Dampier is operating normally,"" said a ship operator source. ""I guess the impact [as it stands now] is that the market goes quiet and is waiting to see the ramifications on schedules.""\n\n""There seems to be a bit more resistance today [April 12], and offers are in at low-$8s/wmt on Rio [April 27-29 cargo],"" the second shipbroker source said. ""No offers were in at the last done level, so maybe the drop [in freight levels] was overcooked. https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/shipping/041223-cyclone-in-western-australia-weighs-on-capesize-freight-rates-threatens-cargo-loadings"
"Eight crucial checks before you put trust in new banks with top rates In recent years, best-buy savings tables have been dominated by banks and building societies unfamiliar to many.\n\nNow another new name -- StreamBank -- has launched a top one-year, fixed-rate savings account, paying 3.5 per cent.\n\nBut before taking the plunge with any new kid on the block, it's vital to do your homework first. Here's what to check for.\n\nResearch: Before you take the plunge with a savings name you have never heard of it, it's important to do your homework.\n\nThis is where to start. Your savings should be covered under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\n\nThis protects balances up to £85,000 -- or £170,000 on joint accounts -- if a provider fails. Avoid any provider without this safety net.\n\nThe compensation limit covers your money with a financial institution -- if you already have money with the same group, it counts towards the total, so make sure you don't bust this limit.\n\nStreamBank is registered. Find the register here.\n\nCheck reviews of banks on Google, Trustpilot and Feefo. The newest might not have many reviews to start with. And be aware, some sites allow firms to pay to remove bad reviews.\n\nRemember, also, that people are more likely to post if they have a negative experience than when they have a good one.\n\nIf it is important for you to telephone to check the status of your account, withdraw cash and undertake other tasks, call a provider's savings line.\n\nThis will give an indication of wait times and how good staff are. Check whether the number is free to call -- if not, your phone bill could eat into your interest.\n\nCustomer service: Giving the provider's dedicated savings number of a call will give a good indication of waiting times and how good the staff are\n\nIf quick access to your cash in an emergency is important, check how fast money is paid into a nominated account.\n\nMany banks say it takes no more than two hours on an easy-access account. Others say it's a next-day service.\n\nGetting money from fixed-rate deals can be slower. And at National Savings & Investments, cashing in Premium Bonds can take days.\n\nSome smaller savings providers have clunky websites.\n\nKevin Mountford, co-founder of savings platform Raisin, advises looking at reviews and visiting a provider's website to see how well it functions.\n\nHe says: 'Savers are increasingly demanding user-friendly application processes. Yet some providers still struggle to offer this via laptops and mobiles. My message is, do your homework.'\n\nMost savings providers will give an idea as to how your money is invested to fund your returns.\n\nTypically, this is via small business, personal or property lending. StreamBank, for example, is using some of savers' cash to lend on commercial buildings.\n\nHolding: Most savings providers will give an idea as to how your money is invested to fund your returns\n\nA handful of the top rates are offered by Islamic banks, such as Al Rayan and Gatehouse.\n\nThey pay 'expected profit' to savers rather than interest, which means it is not guaranteed.\n\nThe accounts invest in ethical, Sharia-compliant activities to make the profit. Both banks are FSCS-protected.\n\nScammers target savers with legitimate-looking accounts.\n\nTell-tale signs of these include rates that are higher than elsewhere; dodgy adverts on social media and pressure tactics from people over the telephone.\n\nCity regulator the Financial Conduct Authority warns criminals can use the names of legitimate firms to defraud.

"What It Takes to Be Middle Class in America's Largest Cities – 2023 Study The middle class has long been considered the backbone of the American economy. But the American middle class is shrinking. The percentage of adults living in middle-income households in the United States fell by more than 10 percentage points over the last 50 years1, indicating an ongoing shrinkage of the middle class.\n\nTo find the true pulse of today's middle class, SmartAsset calculated the bounds on middle class earnings in 100 of the largest U.S. cities, as well as all 50 states.\n\nNortheastern salaries are about 20% higher than Southern salaries - even after accounting for cost of living differences. The Northeast dominates the top 10 highest middle class salary ranges, with many middle class salaries between $60,000 to $170,000. Meanwhile, that same middle class bracket falls between about $35,000 to $100,000 in many Southern states. While the top-placing Northeastern states cost roughly 50% more to live in that the low-ranking Southern states, the middle class salary range sits about 70% higher2.\n\nThe middle class in NYC aren't making enough to keep up with the cost of living. While other notoriously pricey cities like San Francisco and Seattle have a middle class income that trends closely with the general cost of living, New York City wages lag behind. While the middle class wage range was middle of the road of all cities examined, the cost of living in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan are 43%, 70% and 138% higher than the national average, respectively.\n\nMiddle class status is hardest to attain in tech cities. Three out of the top five cities with the highest income thresholds for the middle class are located in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. These middle income residents need to make at least $81,623 in San Francisco, $84,673 in San Jose and $104,499 in Fremont. Seattle residents similarly need to make at least $74,223.\n\nYou're middle class even if you make $310,000 in this California city. Households that earn up to $311,936 per year in Fremont, California, are still technically considered middle class. That's the highest ceiling for any city in our study – Fremont's median household income ($155,968) is almost $30,000 more than the next highest city.\n\nCities With the Highest Middle-Class Ceilings\n\nFremont has the highest minimum threshold for middle class at $104,499, going all the way up to nearly $312,000. Households here need a minimum income of $104,499 to be considered middle class. Fremont's proximity to the high-paying jobs of Silicon Valley contributes to its high median income of $155,968. This Bay Area city has nearly 230,000 residents, and almost one-tenth of that population works at Tesla3.\n\nSan Jose is the third-largest city in California and home to high-profile technology companies, including Adobe, Cisco Systems, eBay, PayPal and Zoom. Middle class households here earn between $84,673 and $252,754.\n\nArlington, situated on the banks of the Potomac River, benefits from its proximity to Washington D.C. and a highly-educated workforce. Over 76% of residents 25 and older hold a bachelor's degree or higher, more than double the national average4. The federal government is Arlington's top employer, with the Department of Defense and a number of other agencies based there5. Middle class households here earn up to $251,302 per year, while those earning less than $84,186 miss the threshold.\n\n4. San Francisco, CA\n\nWhile some large tech companies are based in San Francisco, including Salesforce, Uber and Twitter, the city is also home to non-tech brands like Wells Fargo and The Gap. Middle class households here earn between $81,623 and $243,652. But buying a home in the City by the Bay can be a challenge. The median home value in Frisco is $1.2 million dollars6.\n\nIn Seattle, households earning up to $221,562 are still considered to be middle class. Those earning less than $74,223, however, haven't yet entered this middle income group. Nearly 66% of residents 25 and older hold a bachelor's degree or higher and there are plenty of high-profile local companies to work for, including Amazon, Starbucks and Boeing.\n\nWhile the healthcare and technology industries contribute to Irvine's economy, the University of California, Irvine remains the city's largest employer with over 25,000 faculty and staff7. Middle class households in this Orange County city earn between $70,869 and $211,548 annually.\n\nLocated in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Gilbert's population has grown 31% from 208,000 residents in 2010 to 273,000 in 20228. The median household income of $104,802 sits comfortably in the middle class range of $70,217 and $209,604 per year.\n\nScottsdale is a popular tourist destination with numerous resorts, spas and golf courses. Located about 30 minutes north of Gilbert, this city is also home to healthcare and technology companies9. Middle class families here make between $66,395 and $198,194.\n\nLocated in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Plano is home to 287,000 residents. The local economy is partially supported by the presence of some of the biggest names in banking. JP Morgan Chase, Capital One and Bank of America are the three largest employers in Plano, with a combined total of almost 20,000 workers10. Middle-class families here earn between $63,651 and $190,004. Plano has the lowest average home value of the top 10, at an average $487,000.\n\nChandler is the third Phoenix area city in the top 10. The largest employers here include Intel, Wells Fargo and the local school district11. Middle class households here earn between $63,391 and $189,226 per year, while the average home value in Chandler sits just above Plano's at $492,000.\n\nWhat It Takes to Be Middle Class in the 50 States\n\nMaryland, Washington D.C. and Massachusetts have the three highest floors for the middle class at a statewide level. In all three places, it takes an annual income of more than $60,000 for households to be considered middle class. New Jersey ($59,828) and New Hampshire ($59,272) round out the top five.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Mississippi is the state that requires the lowest annual income to be a part of the middle class ($32,640). The Magnolia State is followed by West Virginia ($34,336), Louisiana ($34,898), Arkansas ($35,194) and Alabama ($36,122).\n\nData and Methodology\n\nTo determine the income limits to be in the middle class, SmartAsset analyzed U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 1-year American Community Survey data for the median household income in all 50 states, as well as the 100 largest U.S. cities. We relied on a variation of the Pew Research definition of middle-income households, which defines a middle class salary range by two-thirds to double the median U.S. salary. We used the local median salary for states and large cities to account for the diversity of financial realities among locales.\n\n1Pew Research Center\n\n2The Council for Community and Economics Research Cost of Living Index, Q3 2022\n\n3City of Fremont, California Annual Comprehensive Financial Report 6/30/2022\n\n4U.S. Census Bureau ACS 1 Yr 2021\n\n5City of Arlington, Virginia Annual Comprehensive Financial Report 6/30/22\n\n6Zillow, data pulled 4/6/23\n\n7City of Irvine, California Annual Comprehensive Financial Report 6/30/22\n\n8U.S. Census Bureau Population Estimate Program 2022\n\n9City of Scottsdale, Arizona Annual Comprehensive Financial Report 6/30/22\n\n10City of Plano, Texas Annual Comprehensive Financial Report 6/30/22\n\n11City of Chandler, Arizona Annual Comprehensive Financial Report 6/30/2021\n\nTips for Middle Income Earners\n\nReassess your housing costs. Households that spend more than 30% of their income on rent, mortgage payments and other housing expenses are considered to be housing cost burdened by the Census Bureau. If your housing costs exceed this threshold, you may want to consider downsizing. SmartAsset has several tools to assess your housing budget, including a calculator designed to help you decide whether to rent or buy in a given market.\n\nConsider delaying retirement. Middle income earners who are approaching retirement may want to consider delaying it by a few years. Delaying retirement until age 70 means you'll max out your Social Security benefits and give your retirement savings extra time to grow. Not everyone is in the position to continue working until age 70, but it may be an option if you're worried about running out of money in retirement.\n\nWork with an expert. Financial advisors aren't just for the ultra wealthy. Plenty of advisors work with middle-class families, helping them save to buy homes, plan for retirement or save for college. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

"AI's ability to learn poses challenge to regulators, companies: 'A little bit scary' Artificial Intelligence poses both risks and rewards, but developers should be weary of technologies that could threaten ""scary"" outcomes, AI technologist says.\n\nThe capacity of artificial intelligence systems to learn things even when they aren\'t explicitly taught those things will pose a significant challenge both to the companies creating and marketing these tools, and federal regulators tasked with protecting consumers who use them, a member of the Federal Trade Commission predicted.\n\n""Personally, and I say this with respect, I do not see the existential threats to our society that others do,"" FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said in recent speech made available this week. ""Yet when you combine these statements with the unpredictability and inexplicability of these models, the sum total is something that we as consumer protection authorities have never reckoned with.""\n\nBedoya was speaking to the International Association of Privacy Professionals about the tendency of generative AI systems to pick up knowledge and intuition about subjects even when programmers aren\'t focusing on those topics. Bedoya said even some developers have said this is something that is ""a little bit scary"" about AI.\n\nFTC STAKES OUT TURF AS TOP AI COP: \'PREPARED TO USE ALL OUR TOOLS\'\n\nOpenAI, led by CEO Sam Altman, developed ChatGPT, which has won rave reviewed from users but has also drawn the eye of the Federal Trade Commission, which says its consumer protection mandate gives it the authority to regulate the system.

Some large language models like ChatGPT can also play chess, even though technical experts aren\'t sure how it picked up that skill.\n\nBedoya said this unpredictable nature of AI could mean future problems for the companies creating these systems, and for the FTC as it tries to protect consumers.\n\nAI EXPERT IN CONGRESS WARNS AGAINST RUSH TO REGULATION: \'WE\'RE NOT THERE YET\'\n\nFTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya warns there are plenty of ways AI can run afoul of current consumer protection laws.

""When the iPhone was first released, it was many things: a phone, a camera, a web browser, an email client, a calendar, and more. Imagine launching the iPhone – having 100 million people using it – but not knowing what it can do or why it can do those things, all while claiming to be frightened of it. That is what we\'re facing today.""\n\nBedoya also made it clear that the FTC is prepared to regulate these products using their mandate to protect consumers from deceptive claims and injury. And he warned that AI developers would likely run into trouble with his agency if they oversell what AI is able to achieve.\n\nOne possible pitfall for these companies is if people are led to believe that AI systems are sentient. He said that while technical experts will say these systems are not emoting and are just imitating human speech, companies could still be liable if consumers have a different perception.\n\n""The law doesn\'t turn on how a trained expert reacts to a technology – it turns on how regular people understand it,"" he said.\n\nELON MUSK\'S WARNINGS ABOUT AI RESEARCH FOLLOWED MONTHS-LONG BATTLE AGAINST \'WOKE\' AI\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission, chaired by Lina Khan, is an agency that has an early regulatory toehold into AI as a consumer protection agency.

"Companies' Hiring Struggles Are Often Self-Inflicted Executives looking forward to a softening labor market with some relief -- at last, it will be easier to hire people! -- might be in for an unwelcome surprise. In a survey released April 4 by the Conference Board, 57% of chief executives said they were having problems attracting qualified workers. While that number has declined from the final quarter of 2022, it still means that more than half of companies find it hard to hire.\n\nFor years, business leaders have complained about their struggles to fill jobs. Usually, they\'ve blamed the economy, or workers themselves, or even the US education system. And sure, there are some jobs that are genuinely tough to fill, whether because there are few people who can do it (data scientist), few people willing to accept low pay to do it (changing diapers of either the adult or baby variety) or few people who want to do it (personal assistant to an ""art world family""). https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-12/need-to-hire-employees-don-t-make-it-so-hard-to-get-a-job"
"Employees Call Out Locker-Room Culture at Phoenix Suns Owner's Company (Bloomberg) -- Mat Ishbia, the billionaire who bought professional basketball\'s Phoenix Suns in February, runs a mortgage company where former and current employees complain of racial disparities, sexual harassment and bullying by managers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Core Inflation Slows Only a Bit, Keeping Fed on Track to Hike\n\nKatie Cotton, Guardian of the Apple Brand for 18 Years, Dies\n\nTwitter Company \'No Longer Exists,\' Is Now Part of Musk\'s X\n\nInflation Data Will Shatter the Stock Market Calm, Goldman Partner Warns\n\nUS Stocks, Bonds Stuck in Range as May Hike Eyed: Markets Wrap\n\nMore than two dozen people who have worked at Ishbia\'s United Wholesale Mortgage in recent years described a high-pressure locker-room environment at the company\'s Pontiac, Michigan, offices. Several said some underwriting managers treated Black workers differently from White employees. Others said leering and sexually offensive remarks were common among sales staff. Most asked not to be named citing fear of reprisals.\n\nIshbia, who turned the company founded by his father into one of the largest originators of US mortgages, purchased a majority stake in the National Basketball Association franchise from Robert Sarver after the league found Sarver had engaged in racist and sexist behavior. The sale valued the team at $4 billion.\n\nNone of the current and former UWM workers said Ishbia himself used racial slurs or sexually harassed employees. But some said managers berated subordinates and openly made sexually suggestive remarks, contributing to what they described as a hostile workplace. Former employees also described repeated cocaine use among some sales staff as well as by executives and managers with influence over their careers.\n\nAmong those who encountered cocaine while working at UWM was Matt Hutchinson, who left the company in June 2021 after two and a half years, the last 15 months of which were spent working at home. He recalled attending a client event at a Topgolf location in Auburn Hills in December 2019, when he says a UWM manager invited him to do a bump of cocaine in front of an independent mortgage broker who worked with the company. ""And I\'m like, \'there\'s nothing I\'d like to do less than sit in a car with you and do blow.\' We had never talked about doing any drug together. To just ask me casually in front of this broker like we had done it before that was crazy to me.""\n\nIn a written response, lawyers for the company said they could find no evidence Hutchinson ever complained about the alleged incident. ""UWM does not tolerate cocaine or any drug use,"" the lawyers wrote, providing a photo of an office entrance marked with the words ""tobacco, drug and weapon free campus."" The lawyers also said the company doesn\'t tolerate any race-based discrimination or sexual harassment. ""UWM\'s culture is built on mutual trust, respect and kindness,"" they wrote, noting that the company was named to Fortune\'s best workplaces for millennials list in 2020.\n\nUWM Chief Marketing Officer Sarah DeCiantis said in a statement that any attempt to portray a negative culture is ""false and misleading."" The company, she wrote, ""has operated for almost 40 years and has employed close to 20,000 team members, and there is nothing, in all that time with all those great people, that suggests this story is anything more than disgruntled individuals or a competitor pushing a false narrative to the media.""\n\nIshbia, a walk-on point guard for Michigan State University\'s national championship basketball team in 2000, has written that he puts in 14-hour days as the company\'s chief executive officer. Some former employees said he helped them jumpstart their careers, provided opportunities for large commissions and motivated them to believe in UWM\'s mission.\n\nFor Ishbia, that mission was driven partly by a rivalry with mortgage company Rocket Cos., a Detroit-based firm founded by billionaire and fellow Michigan State graduate Dan Gilbert, who owns the NBA\'s Cleveland Cavaliers. At Tony Robbins-style events, Ishbia, who\'s worth $8.3 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, told employees a David-and-Goliath story in which, through hard work and dedication, they would dominate the mortgage industry. UWM surpassed Rocket in the second-half of last year, providing more funding for mortgages than any other US lender, according to data compiled by Inside Mortgage Finance.\n\nUWM\'s Michigan office features a medical facility, a hair salon and a VIP break room with premium coffee reserved for high-performing teams. There\'s also a gym and a basketball court. In a conference room festooned with 16 basketballs, including some signed by Michigan State coach Tom Izzo and former NBA star Magic Johnson, top executives talked with Bloomberg News in February about their own experiences at UWM.\n\n""We\'re not just a mortgage company,"" said DeCiantis. ""We\'re part of making the American dream come true."" Chief Growth Officer Desmond Smith said that when he was chief customer officer at Fannie Mae, he would come to the UWM office and think, ""Are we pumping in Vegas air to make people happy?"" adding that most people have smiles on their faces. The company didn\'t make Ishbia available for an interview for this story.\n\nMortgage-lending tips: Bloomberg News is examining the expanding role of nonbank lenders in the US housing market. Share your story by emailing loantips@bloomberg.net\n\nCurrent and former UWM employees provide different accounts. Taryn Dover, a 35-year-old former underwriter and team leader who left UWM in November after what she viewed as a demotion, said she sometimes heard colleagues and managers discussing sex in the workplace. In one instance, she said, she heard a manager talk about bringing employees home with him to have sex. ""So many people around me, they could say whatever they wanted,"" Dover said.\n\nDover, a Black woman, said she reported concerns about interactions with her managers and how they perceived her to Team Member Services, the company\'s human resources department, but nothing changed. She is one of five Black employees interviewed by Bloomberg who said managers held them to a different standard than White colleagues, part of a pattern that she called ""passive-aggressive racism."" Management often cited her attitude, she said. ""I couldn\'t count on both hands the amount of times my attitude"" came up, Dover said. ""I was always \'coached\' on making sure I wasn\'t aggressive.""\n\nUWM\'s lawyers said the company couldn\'t find any evidence that Dover had complained about inappropriate sexual remarks. They also said UWM has strict policies against discrimination in the workplace. The company said people of color make up about one-third of its workforce, but it didn\'t provide any further breakdown or time frame.\n\nTwo other Black employees were threatened with termination after complaining about working conditions, and one of them was fired, according to a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board in 2021. The employees raised concerns about wages and hours, according to partially redacted filings obtained by Bloomberg, but UWM lawyers told the NLRB that the firing was for poor performance and ""worsening negative attitude.""\n\nAfter the NLRB found sufficient merit in the allegations that the company illegally threatened the workers for the case to proceed, UWM agreed in a November 2021 settlement to issue back pay to the fired employee and post a notice saying it wouldn\'t retaliate against anyone who filed such complaints. UWM\'s lawyers told Bloomberg the allegations, which the company denied, did not concern race and that the case was settled ""to avoid the expense of litigating a dispute.""\n\nMore than half a dozen sales employees said they encountered drugs on campus. One recalled arriving at 7 a.m. one day in 2019 to find a manager using cocaine in the bathroom. Another recalled seeing two or more employees enter the same stall on a handful of occasions, before he stopped taking notice.\n\nUWM\'s lawyers said there are 667 cameras on the company\'s campus, none of them in bathrooms, and that ""security has not observed or encountered drug sales."" The lawyers also said there have been no complaints filed with the company\'s human resources department concerning cocaine use on campus.\n\nBut during a five-week period in the fall of 2021, UWM security called local police twice to report cocaine found on campus, police records obtained by Bloomberg show. In one instance, an employee was terminated after dropping a ""dime bag"" in a stairwell, the documents show. In the other, a security guard found a bag of the drug in a bathroom. UWM\'s lawyers said these were among ""a few instances over the course of years where security identified the presence of drugs on campus and handled them appropriately.""\n\nFormer employees also said cocaine was present at parties hosted by executives at their homes and at casinos, restaurants and hotels in the Detroit area. Though these weren\'t company events, some of those managers had the power to allocate accounts, several salespeople said. Some said they saw the gatherings as a way to get face time with decision-makers.\n\nThe UWM lawyers said the company has no role in private gatherings and can\'t speak to the off-duty conduct of its employees. The parties that employees described to Bloomberg would have been ""contrary to UWM\'s values and not consistent with its culture,"" the lawyers wrote.\n\nFormer employees said some managers went over the top in interpersonal communications. One said he was berated on three occasions between 2018 and 2020 by an executive who has worked at UWM for more than 20 years. The same executive last year told another former employee, a saleswoman in her 50s, that strong women come across as ""bitches,"" according to three people familiar with the incident. He repeated the slur twice more during their conversation, stopping only after the employee asked him to, two of the people said. UWM\'s lawyers said the executive denied bullying anyone and the company doesn\'t tolerate physical intimidation or threats.\n\nOne account executive said she was pushed out of her position last year after a manager told her she was not emotionally intelligent. The former employee sent a letter to Ishbia, seen by Bloomberg, detailing allegations of gender discrimination on the sales team, which she described as humiliating. In one instance, she wrote, a male colleague questioned if she was having her period. The company\'s lawyers said UWM could not locate the email, but Ishbia sent a response, reviewed by Bloomberg, thanking the woman for reaching out, promising to dig into the matter and wishing her luck in the future.\n\nSome employees recalled sales staff and managers commenting about the attractiveness of new employees whose photos were included in in-house emails. Others complained about a requirement to send videos to outside mortgage brokers, who are UWM\'s customers. The videos, called USnaps, are intended to build collegial relationships. But more than half a dozen people said it was a loathsome task that sometimes led to unwanted comments about their looks and other unwelcome interactions. Some said they reported their discomfort to managers but that nothing came of the complaints. Others said they didn\'t say anything.\n\nUWM Chief Operating Officer Melinda Wilner said there are many ways to escalate a concern and that ""it\'s difficult for me to understand why someone would feel that they couldn\'t."" The company\'s lawyers said that UWM could not locate any documented complaints about broker misconduct related to USnaps in the past year or inappropriate comments directed at new hires.\n\nIshbia, who donated $32 million to his alma mater in 2020, keeps close with former teammates. In January 2019, he hired one of them, Mateen Cleaves, as a leadership development coach. Cleaves, an All-American who went on to play in the NBA, was awaiting trial in a sexual-assault case at the time.\n\nCleaves was acquitted later that year, but while his case was pending, some employees said his role at UWM -- which included holding one-on-one meetings on the company\'s campus -- made them uncomfortable. They also said that a video shown during the trial and later broadcast on local TV disturbed them. It showed a naked Cleaves chasing a mostly naked woman through a motel parking lot. Cleaves\'s lawyer said in court that the sex was consensual and that his client was trying to prevent the woman from walking around unclothed. ""To be portrayed as a rapist, it broke my heart every day,"" Cleaves said after the verdict. ""But lying about rape is just as bad.""\n\nUWM\'s lawyers said Cleaves was presumed innocent at the time he was hired and that while he did hold one-on-one meetings before and after he was acquitted, employees could request a different leadership coach.\n\nAnother former basketball star has a role at UWM. In 2021, the company added Isiah Thomas, who\'d played for the Detroit Pistons, as an independent director to its nine-member board, which includes Ishbia, his father, his brother and three company executives. In 2007, Thomas, then the coach of the New York Knicks, was found to have sexually harassed a former team executive who was then fired after complaining about unwanted approaches. Madison Square Garden, the owner of the Knicks, agreed to pay her $11.5 million in damages. UWM\'s lawyers said Thomas ""is an accomplished leader in business"" and serves on the boards of other companies, including Madison Square Garden Entertainment. A spokeswoman for Thomas, who is also CEO of cannabis-growing company One World Products, didn\'t comment.\n\nLast year, as interest rates rose, the mortgage business took a beating. In April, when Rocket announced layoffs, Ishbia called the move ""disgusting"" in a LinkedIn post and promised never to have a layoff.\n\nDespite the pledge, head count at UWM fell by about one-third to roughly 6,000 at the end of last year from 9,000 in June 2021, according to company filings. In the last quarter of 2022, the company posted its first loss since going public two years earlier. Adam Mendelsohn, a spokesman for UWM, said a mid-2021 return-to-office policy accounted for most of the headcount decrease.\n\nSome of the people who left offered a different reason for their departures. Five former salesmen said UWM managers increased their focus on setting difficult daily targets after the mortgage market soured. That practice, known internally as ""running plays,"" seemed designed to make staffers miserable and sometimes preceded dismissals, the salesmen said. Chief People Officer Laura Lawson said in an interview that UWM doesn\'t create targets so people can\'t succeed. ""We don\'t set people up to fail,"" she said.\n\nHutchinson, one of the salesmen, says he left feeling ""spent and bitter -- it\'s a toxic environment."" Another salesman, Matthew Golden, who left in August, said doing so was like going through a bad divorce. ""I was so on board,"" said Golden, who spent more than four years at UWM. In some ways, the former salesman said, he has to give Ishbia credit. ""The greatest finesse in the world is convincing people you care without having to care,"" he said. ""That high-level manipulation is very profitable.""\n\n--With assistance from Ann Choi and Josh Eidelson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIRS Vets Reveal What\'s Broken at America\'s Most Hated Agency\n\nA Runner\'s Murder in Kenya Opens a Window Into Violence Against Women\n\nThe Business of … Death\n\nWhat to Do With Your Money--and Your Life--in a Wild New World\n\nThe Fight Over the Abortion Pill Is Just Getting Started\n\n 2023 Bloomberg L.P. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/employees-call-locker-room-culture-110037409.html"

(John Chapple for Fox News Digital )\n\nThe high-profile crime and Musk\'s comments sparked widespread discussion of San Francisco\'s crime problem, with many pointing out that the Twitter CEO\'s argument doesn\'t align with statistics.\n\n""San Francisco is close to the bottom of the list of major cities, with 6.9 homicides per 100,000 people,"" one article from ABC 7 said, citing FBI and San Francisco police data.\n\nThe data, reviewed by Fox News Digital, does show San Francisco coming in at a lower homicide rate than other major cities, with its murder rate checking in below St. Louis, Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Chicago, Oakland, Minneapolis, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, Austin and Washington, D.C.\n\nOther forms of violent crime such as rapes and assaults have also remained relatively stable in San Francisco over the last four years, the data shows, while murders have ticked up slightly. Property crimes, on the other hand, have risen sharply since 2019.\n\nBut, according to Stimson, going back further paints a clearer picture of the problem that has recently plagued San Francisco.\n\nFORMER DRUG DEALER SPEAKS OUT AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO DRUG SCENE: IT\'S BECOMING A PLACE FOR \'DRUGGY TOURISM\'\n\nThe first problem, according to Stimson, was the election of a Soros-backed D.A. with a reputation as soft of crime.\n\nStimson was referring to former San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón, who served in that role from January 2011 until October 2019. Stimson argued that Gascón\'s term ushered in a new era of rising crime in San Francisco, which had been experiencing nearly two decades of tumbling crime rates at the same time as many other major cities across the country.\n\nHomeless encampment in San Francisco April 7, 2023. (John Chapple for Fox News Digital )\n\nStimson argued that as Gascón\'s policies started to take hold in the city, crime started to rise around 2015 and 2016. The city\'s residents got no reprieve from the problem when Gascón left office, thanks to similar policies of former District Attorney Chesa Boudin from January 2020 until he was recalled in July 2022.\n\n""Those policies include not prosecuting any misdemeanors, watering down most felonies to misdemeanors, not asking for long prison sentences even for people who are convicted of the worst crimes, never asking for bail,"" Stimson said.\n\nCiting FBI and Justice Department data, Stimson pointed out that in the five years before Gascón took office in 2011, there were 757 reported rapes, an average of 151 per year, in San Francisco. But in Gascón\'s last five years in office, the city had a total of 1,731 reported rapes, or 346 per year.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO SURVEILLANCE VIDEO ILLUSTRATES AGONY OF CITY CRIME IN BOB LEE\'S FINAL MOMENTS\n\n""You always know with rape … the number of people actually raped is much higher than the number of people who report that they were raped,"" Stimson said.\n\nHe also pointed to aggravated assaults, which, in the five years before Gascón\'s tenure, tallied up to 11,921 reported incidents, or 2,384 per year. In the last five years of Gascón\'s term, that number jumped to 13,070, or 2,614 per year.\n\nSuch policies continued under the watch of Boudin, producing crime numbers that continued to hover well over pre-2011 rates.\n\nPier 28 in San Francisco April 7, 2023. (John Chapple for Fox News Digital )\n\nSan Francisco\'s crime issues did not stop with violent crime. The city has also had a surge of retail thefts that have forced many businesses to close their doors in recent years.\n\n""Gascón and Boudin refused to prosecute retail thefts,"" Stimson said, citing a policy in which retails thefts under $1,000 went unprosecuted.\n\nCASH APP FOUNDER BOB LEE DIED PLEADING WITH 911 FOR HELP: REPORT\n\n""You\'ve seen the videos of people just engaging in the five-finger discount, walking into Target, walking into Nordstrom Rack … and just walking out during daylight with $950 worth of stuff,"" Stimson said. ""They refused to prosecute any of that.""\n\nThe lack of any serious threat of prosecution led many city residents and businesses to stop reporting the crimes altogether, a reality that has resulted in what is likely a vast undercount of such crimes in available statistics, he claimed.\n\nGeneral view of the area surrounding Magnolia, Laguna and Lombard Streets in San Francisco April 7, 2023. (John Chapple for Fox News Digital )\n\n""Dozens of Walgreens just up and left, and they said publicly the reason they\'re leaving is because the rampant theft,"" Stimson said. ""Their employees were in danger. Other stores just shuttered in San Francisco, which obviously deprives a lot of the inner city residents a place to buy their groceries and other necessary items.""\n\nOther issues have continued to plague the city in the last decade, Stimson pointed out, including the ""defund the police"" movement and sanctuary city policies.\n\n""In San Francisco, in particular, you have a sanctuary city problem,"" Stimson said. ""City leaders refuse to cooperate with ICE, refuse to turn over people who have been convicted and sentenced to state prison.""\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut with Boudin being recalled from office, Stimson expressed optimism things could begin to turn around for the city, though he cautioned that any changes will take time to reverse the damage done over the last decade.\n\n""There is hopefully a better ending to this story,"" Stimson said. ""They\'re starting to arrest people. They\'re starting to roll up the tents where all these rapes and sexual assaults are happening. … But it\'s still a sanctuary city, so illegal aliens, who represent a good percentage of people who have been arrested, they aren\'t being turned over to ICE even after they\'re convicted. https://www.foxnews.com/us/san-francisco-crime-problem-runs-deeper-than-rosy-statistics-from-city"
"The mounting human and environmental costs of generative AI Over the past few months, the field of artificial intelligence has seen rapid growth, with wave after wave of new models like Dall-E and GPT-4 emerging one after another. Every week brings the promise of new and exciting models, products, and tools. It\'s easy to get swept up in the waves of hype, but these shiny capabilities come at a real cost to society and the planet.\n\nDownsides include the environmental toll of mining rare minerals, the human costs of the labor-intensive process of data annotation, and the escalating financial investment required to train AI models as they incorporate more parameters.\n\nLet\'s look at the innovations that have fueled recent generations of these models--and raised their associated costs.\n\nIn recent years, AI models have been getting bigger, with researchers now measuring their size in the hundreds of billions of parameters. ""Parameters"" are the internal connections used within the models to learn patterns based on the training data.\n\nFor large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, we\'ve gone from around 100 million parameters in 2018 to 500 billion in 2023 with Google\'s PaLM model. The theory behind this growth is that models with more parameters should have better performance, even on tasks they were not initially trained on, although this hypothesis remains unproven.\n\nBigger models typically take longer to train, which means they also need more GPUs, which cost more money, so only a select few organizations are able to train them. Estimates put the training cost of GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters, at $4.6 million--out of reach for the majority of companies and organizations. (It\'s worth noting that the cost of training models is dropping in some cases, such as in the case of LLaMA, the recent model trained by Meta.)\n\nThis creates a digital divide in the AI community between those who can train the most cutting-edge LLMs (mostly Big Tech companies and rich institutions in the Global North) and those who can\'t (nonprofit organizations, startups, and anyone without access to a supercomputer or millions in cloud credits). Building and deploying these behemoths requires a lot of planetary resources: rare metals for manufacturing GPUs, water to cool huge data centers, energy to keep those data centers running 24/7 on a planetary scale… all of these are often overlooked in favor of focusing on the future potential of the resulting models.\n\nA study from Carnegie Melon University professor Emma Strubell about the carbon footprint of training LLMs estimated that training a 2019 model called BERT, which has only 213 million parameters, emitted 280 metric tons of carbon emissions, roughly equivalent to the emissions from five cars over their lifetimes. Since then, models have grown and hardware has become more efficient, so where are we now?\n\nIn a recent academic article I wrote to study the carbon emissions incurred by training BLOOM, a 176-billion parameter language model, we compared the power consumption and ensuing carbon emissions of several LLMs, all of which came out in the last few years. The goal of the comparison was to get an idea of the scale of emissions of different sizes of LLMs and what impacts them. https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/generative-ai-is-cool-but-lets-not-forget-its-human-and-environmental-costs/"

"John Lennon's ex May Pang on Yoko Ono pushing her to have affair with married Beatle: 'Tears started to form' Pang, a former assistant to the married couple, is detailing her 18-month romance with the ""Imagine"" singer in a new documentary, \'The Lost Weekend: A Love Story.\'\n\nMay Pang was just 22 years old when she reluctantly became John Lennon\'s girlfriend -- at the request of his wife Yoko Ono.\n\nThe couple\'s former assistant, who found herself in the middle of an 18-month romance with the ""Imagine"" singer, is telling her story in a new documentary, ""The Lost Weekend: A Love Story."" The film, which made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2022, features rarely heard home recordings and a candid interview with Lennon\'s eldest son, Julian.\n\nIn it, Pang aims to set the record straight on her story, one that has become part of rock mythology since Lennon died in 1980. A spokesperson for Ono, 90, indicated to Fox News Digital that there would be no response at this time regarding Pang\'s documentary.\n\n""It\'s hard to believe, but it is 50 years now since my relationship with John began,"" the 72-year-old told Fox News Digital. ""There was so much of my own story being told by other people that had no idea. It got the best of me after a while. It was my life, and everybody else is telling it. Many people still think I only spent a weekend with him. They didn\'t know the truth.""\n\nPang, the American-born daughter of Chinese immigrants, grew up in New York City\'s Spanish Harlem during the \'60s, when she discovered her first love – rock \'n\' roll. In the film, Pang admitted her favorite Beatle as a teen was Ringo Starr, noting she ""was partial to blue eyes.""\n\nIn 1969, the 19-year-old college dropout scored a gig as an office assistant for Apple Records, the Fab Four\'s label. In 1970, Lennon and Ono relocated from London to New York. Pang, eager to escape the mundane office life, began working as the couple\'s personal assistant.\n\nBEATLE RINGO STARR REFLECTS ON SPREADING \'PEACE AND LOVE\' FOLLOWING THE \'60S: \'IT WAS PART OF HOW WE FELT\'\n\nMay Pang was an office assistant for Apple Records before she began working for John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono. (Courtesy of May Pang)\n\n""They were doing two movies, \'Up Your Legs Forever\' and \'Fly,\'"" Pang recalled. ""It was a bit kooky, but I rolled with it because it was fun. … And they were larger than life. You read about them all the time in the papers, how they were spreading their message of peace around the world. And when I started to work for them, everything became fast paced. I didn\'t get much sleep.""\n\nLennon, 10 years older than Pang, had been married to Ono since 1969. However, the pair, depicted as soulmates, had hit a rough patch. Ono, who wanted some time apart, was eager to save her marriage. It was in 1973 when Ono asked the young assistant to date her husband in hopes of keeping him company.\n\nPang said that day seemed like any other at the couple\'s office -- at first.\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono married in 1969.

""In my head, I\'m thinking, \'Oh my God, I haven\'t even had my first cup of coffee yet. … I grab my pad, my pen, and I\'m ready to write. And she said, \'John and I are not getting along.\' I said, \'I\'m so sorry to hear [that].\' And then she says, \'You know, John\'s gonna go out with other people.\' And I thought, \'OK, now we\'re into another territory. Who can this be? We are adding another person to this mix?\' And then she says, \'But you know what? You don\'t have a boyfriend.\'""\n\nPang initially thought she misheard Ono.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nMay Pang said she wasn\'t interested in dating John Lennon at first. (Peter Simins/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)\n\n""I\'m going, \'I\'m not interested, I\'m not interested,\'"" said Pang. ""She goes, \'Oh, I know, but I think you\'ll be good for him.\' I said, \'I don\'t want to go out with him.\' Now, people don\'t realize I\'ve worked there for three years. I was very happy with the job. … That\'s all I wanted to do. All of a sudden, she says, \'Go out with John Lennon.\' He was not John Lennon as everybody out there saw him. He was John Lennon, this man I worked for. … So I wasn\'t interested.""\n\nMay Pang claimed it was Yoko Ono (pictured here) who pushed her into dating John Lennon. (Michael Putland/Getty Images)\n\n""It was hard to process,"" she added. ""I said no. And she kept saying, \'You\'d be good for him.\' She walks out of the room, and I just sat there. For a split second, I\'m going, \'What just happened?\' And tears started to just form in my eyes. I didn\'t know where I was going. I didn\'t know what to do.""\n\n\'50S STAR ANGIE DICKINSON ON FRANK SINATRA AND WHY SHE NEVER MARRIED \'LOVE OF MY LIFE\'\n\nA relationship quickly blossomed between John Lennon and May Pang, which was later dubbed the ""Lost Weekend"" after the 1945 Billy Wilder film. (Art Zelin/Getty Images)\n\nAt first, neither Pang nor Lennon seemed interested. But their attraction for each other became undeniable. He first stole a kiss from her at the elevator of the Dakota, where he lived with Ono. Soon, Lennon ""charmed the pants off of me."" In the film, Pang admitted she cried the first time they had sex, not knowing where the relationship would lead.\n\nThe pair bonded over their mutual love of music. Pang attempted to go with the flow as Lennon let his hair down. The two became inseparable, she said.\n\nMay Pang said she and John Lennon fell for each other quickly. ""I knew he loved me,"" Pang told Fox News Digital. (Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)\n\n""I didn\'t think he was attracted to me,"" Pang admitted. ""It was a big surprise. Despite everything that was said, it was he who pursued it more than anything else. I was just trying to hold back. … And you don\'t want to be hurt either.""\n\nAt first glance, the couple seemed like any other. They shared deep conversations over songs, enjoyed dinners together at a local diner, jetted off to Los Angeles, where they spent time with other musicians and made each other laugh behind closed doors. Lennon drew comedic sketches for Pang. For her 23rd birthday, Lennon bought her an orange Plymouth Barracuda.\n\nPang claimed that Ono, suspecting possibly more was unfolding, would call up to 15 times a day to check in.\n\nMOTHER OF STEVEN TYLER\'S DAUGHTER LIV HITS BACK AT \'GROUPIE\' MONIKER\n\nMay Pang said she and John Lennon became inseparable to Yoko Ono\'s surprise. (Courtesy of May Pang)\n\nThe whirlwind romance was not all sweetness. In the film, Pang described how Lennon, in a drunken rage, smashed up their LA pad. She also detailed how Lennon recorded his ""Rock \'n\' Roll"" album with notorious music producer Phil Spector, who, according to Pang, liked poppers and guns.\n\nThe relationship carried on and, in 1974, the pair moved in together. Pang even encouraged Lennon to heal his relationship with Julian. At the time, he hadn\'t seen his firstborn in several years.\n\nThe couple brought Julian Lennon, left, to Disney World, where he and his father John Lennon got closer. (John Rodgers/Redferns)\n\n""He hadn\'t seen [his ex-wife Cynthia] since he walked out the door,"" Pang explained. ""It was time for Julian to come to visit him, and [Lennon] was really nervous. I remember he kept pacing like a tiger, smoking up a storm. I told him, \'You\'re not alone. I know this is hard, but I\'ll be there.\' I just thought it was so important for Julian\'s sake. I just remember Julian running into his arms. It was beautiful. I just wanted to be there as a buffer. And they all finally got a chance to sit down and talk about how they felt. Once that was cleared up, he didn\'t have this angst anymore. … That\'s exactly what I wanted for Julian.""\n\nMay Pang said it was important for her to see John and Julian Lennon\'s relationship heal. (Courtesy of May Pang)\n\nAs the relationship between father and son healed, Pang developed a lifelong friendship with Cynthia. It was one that lasted until Cynthia died in 2015.\n\n\'ST.

He even told Pang, ""I\'ll be a free man in six months."" But it never happened. Lennon claimed he was receiving pushback from Ono. Pang said she believed the relationship surprised Ono, who then wanted her husband back. Knowing that Lennon was trying to quit smoking to conserve his famous voice, Ono allegedly told him she knew a hypnotist who could help him. All he had to do was come back home.\n\nAccording to May Pang, John Lennon went back to Yoko Ono after the artist told him she could help him with his smoking. (Gijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns)\n\nOnce Lennon went back to Ono to take her up on her offer, Pang knew her relationship was over. The couple called it quits in early 1975. Over the years, she said, they would see each other.\n\nMay Pang said she last spoke to John Lennon during Memorial Day weekend in 1980. Lennon was killed in December 1980. (Courtesy of May Pang)\n\nPang said she last spoke to Lennon during Memorial Day weekend 1980. It was a nearly two-hour conversation over the phone that concluded with Lennon saying, ""I\'m going to see you soon.""\n\nThey never saw each other again.\n\n""Our time together never really ended as it were,"" she said. ""We didn\'t get closure.""\n\nMay Pang admitted she never got closure with John Lennon and is still coping with his death. (Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)\n\nIn December 1980, Lennon was gunned down by a crazed fan outside his New York City apartment. He was 40.\n\nOver the years, a devastated Pang reinvented herself, pursuing careers in writing and jewelry design. Today, she looks back at her time with Lennon fondly, only choosing to remember the good times they shared, not what might have been.\n\nBEATLE PAUL MCCARTNEY\'S DAUGHTER TALKS JOHN LENNON, CREATING HEARTFELT DOC WITH HER DAD\n\nMay Pang has since reinvented herself as a jewelry designer.

"Goldman Sachs To Edge Past The Consensus In Q1 POLAND - 2023/03/21: In this photo illustration, a Goldman Sachs logo is displayed on a smartphone ... [ ] with stock market percentages in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2023 results on Tuesday, April 18, 2023. We expect Goldman Sachs to edge past the consensus estimates of revenues and earnings. The investment bank underperformed expectations in the last quarter, with revenues decreasing by 16% y-o-y to $10.59 billion. The top line mainly suffered due to a 48% decline in investment banking and a 27% drop in the asset & wealth management units. That said, the impact was partially offset by growth in platform solutions and FICC (fixed income, currency, & commodity) trading segments.

The bank's adjusted net income declined by 49% y-o-y to $10.76 billion in 2022. It was partly due to lower revenues, and partly because of higher expense figures. The expense figure swelled due to an unfavorable build-up in the provisions for credit losses from $357 million to $2.7 billion, and higher operating expenses as a % of revenues. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Goldman Sachs is likely to report an annual EPS of $34.22 for the full-year 2023.\n\n(3) Stock price estimate is 22% higher than the current market price\n\nWe arrive at Goldman Sachs' valuation, using an EPS estimate of around $ 34.22 and a P/E multiple of just just below 12x in fiscal 2023.

"AI Can Clone Your Favorite Podcast Host's Voice One day this year, you\'ll start listening to a podcast and realize something is a little off. The host, whose voice is familiar to you, will sound different. Sentences may be stilted or some words will have an odd tone. And so you\'ll ask, Is this actually the host talking or their AI voice clone?\n\nJust as artificial intelligence has proven adept at generating lifelike images, effective videos, and cogent text, similar technologies can convincingly mimic the voices of podcast hosts, content creators, and other media professionals. A new set of tools from a growing list of startups is expected to hasten AI\'s conquest of our audio feeds.\n\nOur ears are already familiar with computer-generated speech. Artificial voices are playing DJ and answering your phone calls. Technologists have cloned the voices of celebrities alive and dead and reconstructed the voices of those who have lost their ability to speak due to illness. Someday soon, AI-powered speech tools will be able to bring back the voices of our dead relatives.\n\nWhen it comes to producing podcasts, machines have proven able to lend a hand in the editing room. Editing services like Descript offer machine learning features that clean up an audio recording of human speech by removing awkward pauses and filler words such as ""um"" and ""like.""\n\nLately, even more options are emerging to take care of the really messy part of making a podcast: the talking. Descript offers a feature called Overdub, which creates a virtual voice that can be used in production editing. If a host mispronounces somebody\'s name or gets a date wrong, a producer can task the robot with saying it correctly, then paste in the correction.\n\nNewer tools go even further. In January, Podcastle, a startup that offers a suite of podcasting software, released an AI-powered voice cloning tool called Revoice that can create a digital simulacrum of a human host. The company is positioning Revoice as a way for producers to create any aspect of an audio production--from ad reads to voiceovers to audiobooks--just by typing in the words they want the virtual version of the host to say.\n\nCreating a digital copy of your voice takes a bit of work. While some AI services can emulate voices by studying audio clips of the person talking, Podcastle requires users to read off a script of around 70 phrases, selected to capture a variety of mouth movements and phonemes. The process takes 30 to 45 minutes, depending on how particular you are about getting the intonations right.\n\n""The idea was always that it should be very close to your original voice,"" Podcastle CEO Artavazd Yeritsyan says of the resulting voice clone. ""Not a beautification or making your voice even better than it is, but very accurate in how you pronounce the words.""\n\nIt\'s a lofty goal, but voice AI doesn\'t always sound quite as melodious as an actual human voice would. The tone (at least in my experimentation) comes across as monotonous and robotic, with weird stutters and synthetic artifacts throughout. https://www.wired.com/story/ai-podcasts-podcastle-revoice-descript/"

"The 'Space Invaders' Creator Reveals the Game's Origin Story The titular space invaders in Taito\'s 1978 arcade classic have a look that\'s among the most iconic in video games. During development, they almost took forms as mundane as human figures or tanks. But chance occurrences gave them designs that became synonymous with video games.\n\nInvaders today adorn T-shirts and posters. Open your emoji keyboard and an approximation lurks within, dubbed ""alien monster."" An iPhone will suggest said critter when you type in ""game."" It\'s a tacit understanding of the unbreakable link between those few pixels and the entire games industry, even for people who\'ve never played Space Invaders.\n\nTomohiro Nishikado, creator of Space Invaders.\n\nBut the fact that the game exists at all is down to the remarkable achievements of creator Tomohiro Nishikado. His work reimagined and elevated an industry, defined and popularized key concepts that are still used decades later, and spawned a cultural and technological phenomenon.\n\nIt all started with Atari\'s Breakout. ""I was hooked on it,"" Nishikado told WIRED. When Taito management asked him to make something that would surpass Atari\'s brick-basher, Nishikado was already deep in thought about how to achieve this. ""I decided to plan a shooting game, which was my forte. But until then, shooting games were mainly time-based--players defeated as many targets as possible within a set period. So I decided to make a game with a lives system, and interactive gameplay in which multiple enemies would attack the player.""\n\nHis initial design had you shoot at tanks, but Nishikado remembers that their shape and movement ""didn\'t feel right."" The team tried fighter planes and battleships, but those didn\'t work any better with the limited technology of the day. ""I then tried a solider and was satisfied with the movement, but there was an opinion that shooting people was not a good idea, and so I gave up on that,"" says Nishikado.\n\nA solution arrived in the form of War of the Worlds. Nishikado remembered the 1953 film from his childhood and became inspired by various media depictions of the invaders, which often resembled sea life. ""I based a new target on an octopus, and since it was now an alien, there was no problem shooting it,"" he says. And with the shape not having to be specifically recognizable, any issues with realism went away. Nishikado set about creating further enemies, abstracted from marine creatures like crabs and squids.\n\nAs all of this was happening, Nishikado was reimagining how video games were created in Japan. ""Unlike conventional games in Japan at the time, Space Invaders was a software-controlled game that used a microcomputer,"" he says. Such games already existed in the US, but there was scant information about them in Japan, and no existing development hardware. So Nishikado built his own.\n\n""I studied American games to learn how to make games with microcomputers. It took me about half a year to master that,"" he says. ""And because I didn\'t have satisfactory equipment for game development, I made my own by referring to American game boards. Parallel to this, I was working on game planning, characters, and programming--almost all by myself. Little by little, I improved the functions of my hardware, and by the time Space Invaders was completed, I was satisfied. https://www.wired.com/story/space-invaders-45-years-tomohiro-nishikado/"

"Top US Banks to Reveal $521 Billion Deposit Drop, Most in Decade (Bloomberg) -- The largest US banks are about to reveal how they fared as customer deposits came under siege in the first quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKatie Cotton, Guardian of the Apple Brand for 18 Years, Dies\n\nTwitter Company \'No Longer Exists,\' Is Now Part of Musk\'s X\n\nElizabeth Holmes Will Have to Wait Out Her Appeal in Prison\n\nInflation Data Will Shatter the Stock Market Calm, Goldman Partner Warns\n\nTumbling Money Supply Alarms Economists Who Foresaw Inflation\n\nDeposits at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are expected to have tumbled $521 billion from a year earlier, the biggest drop in a decade, according to analysts\' estimates. The decline -- which includes a $61 billion slide in just the first quarter -- comes as a late influx of cash following a crisis at regional lenders failed to offset the steady drain of customers to products offering higher rates.\n\n""By far the biggest issue for the banks is around deposits, both for the quarter and for March,"" Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Mike Mayo said in an interview. ""Non-answers are a failing grade for this take home exam.""\n\nWestern Alliance Bancorp learned that lesson the hard way last week, when it released updated financial information that left out data on deposit levels. Shareholders sent the Phoenix-based firm\'s stock tumbling, until it released deposit data later in the day that was better than some analysts had feared.\n\nFor smaller competitors like Western Alliance, the problem is twofold: Their customers also want more for their money, and the recent collapse of three regional lenders has left consumers jittery, prompting them to yank their cash and store it in larger banks instead.\n\nThe turmoil has also weighed on bank stocks. The KBW Bank Index is down 19% this year, and lost 25% in March alone. Regional banks were the biggest losers for the period, with First Republic Bank down 89%.\n\nThe coming first-quarter disclosures from the big banks could intensify concerns about deposit-mix and, should lenders miss expectations, set off more inquiries about the health and future of the industry.\n\nLenders began seeing deposits dwindling as early as the start of last year, as historic levels of inflation ate away at consumers\' savings. Still, they were largely able to keep a lid on deposit costs, with many banks still paying just a few basis points in interest on basic checking accounts.\n\nThat\'s changed. Amid the cacophony of headlines about the Federal Reserve\'s aggressive push to raise interest rates, consumers and companies have flocked to money market funds, sending the total amount in these funds to a record $5.2 trillion from $4.59 trillion a year ago.\n\nThat means deposit betas, the percentage of change in market rates that banks pass on to their customers, will be in focus in the coming days as they have lagged behind in recent quarters.\n\n""It had already been a fiercely competitive environment for deposit gathering, and the recent bank failures may turn the deposit knife fight into a metaphorical gun fight,"" Wedbush Securities analysts David Chiaverini and Brian Violino wrote in a note.\n\nWhile raising rates could force banks to cough up a few more basis points to savers, they are also handing them record amounts of net interest income. For the biggest banks, that\'s boosting net interest margins, a key gauge of profitability that measures the difference between what a bank pays depositors and what it collects on loans.\n\nStill, analysts worry that as banks are forced to spend more on depositors, they\'ll see those margins shrink.\n\n""April earnings will be about the outlook, not the results,"" Betsy Graseck, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients in which she lowered the outlook for banks\' profits in 2023 and 2024 ""to reflect accelerating deposit betas driving down NIMs.""\n\nLiability Management\n\nThe effects of rising interest rates will be felt elsewhere in earnings as well. Back when banks were sitting on record levels of deposits, many lenders chose to invest that excess cash in safe assets -- such as Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities -- to get a little bit of yield while they waited for loan demand to materialize.\n\nAs the Fed\'s push to raise rates got underway, it caused the value of those assets to fall. Now, lenders will be scrutinized for those earlier decisions on how and where they invested their excess cash.\n\n""This is a nightmare on ALM-street -- asset liability management,"" Wells Fargo\'s Mayo said.\n\nTo be sure, most US banks will hold these assets to maturity, so the losses don\'t materialize unless they have to sell. Plus, the collapse of three regional lenders has sparked a rally in Treasuries, which should curb some of the paper losses.\n\nThat\'s left analysts and investors looking for some kind of update on how these securities portfolios are performing and whether the recent upheaval has changed banks\' approach to investing.\n\n""Investors and stakeholders are going to look at the makeup of a bank\'s balance sheet and held-to-maturity assets, which many didn\'t pay much attention to until the last few weeks,"" John Walsh, leader of EY Americas\' banking and capital markets operation, said in an interview.\n\nDespite the recent volatility, banks have still warned that trading revenue is likely to show a drop for the first three months of the year compared to a year earlier, when Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine roiled markets and spurred client activity.\n\nFor the five biggest Wall Street banks - a group that includes JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley -- total trading revenue is expected to slump $3.2 billion, or 10%, to $29.9 billion.\n\nThose firms have also said the recent market upheaval has contributed to extending the slowdown in dealmaking and capital-markets businesses. Across the five biggest companies, such fees are expected to drop a whopping 25% from last year\'s already low levels.\n\n""A lot of this depends on how the geopolitical and macro environment kind of plays out,"" Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason warned last month. ""The trajectory of the rebound is really going to depend on that to some extent.""\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Runner\'s Murder in Kenya Opens a Window Into Violence Against Women\n\nThe Business of … Death\n\nWhat to Do With Your Money--and Your Life--in a Wild New World\n\nThe Fight Over the Abortion Pill Is Just Getting Started\n\nScaramucci\'s SkyBridge Capital Was Spiraling, and Then Came FTX\n\n 2023 Bloomberg L.P. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-us-banks-reveal-521-110000702.html"

"Russia risks becoming an 'economic colony of China' following its invasion of Ukraine, says CIA director The director of the CIA said that Russia risks ""becoming an economic colony of China"" as it is increasingly isolated from the rest of the world after its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWilliam Burns was speaking at Rice University in Houston on Tuesday, where he said that ""Russia is becoming more and more dependent on China and, in some respects, runs the risk of becoming an economic colony of China over time, dependent for export of energy resources and raw materials,"" CNBC reported.\n\nHe said that the country\'s actions had been a ""huge own goal for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin\'s Russia.""\n\nRussia has become increasingly sealed off from much of the world since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Many nations, particularly in the West, have placed sanctions on Russian businesses and the country\'s elite.\n\nThe sanctions have also targeted Russia\'s banking system, with the EU saying these are aimed at ""weakening Russia\'s ability to finance the war and specifically target the political, military and economic elite responsible for the invasion.""\n\nAs a result, Russia has increasingly looked to China since the war began.\n\nChina initially appeared unhappy with Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, with Putin saying in September that China had ""questions and concerns"" about it.\n\nChina\'s President Xi Jinping also criticized Russia\'s nuclear rhetoric in November.\n\nBut the war appears to have strengthened economic ties, which includes China buying more Russian oil now than it did before the invasion began.\n\nUS officials have warned that China may be preparing to give Russia weapons, though it has not yet done so.\n\nRussia also retains political and economic relations with other countries, but many of them are small nations that were once part of the Soviet Union, and still rely on their economic ties with their larger neighbor.\n\nOther large nations have continued to work with Russia economically.

"Colombia: Gran Tierra Energy announces contract agreement for the Suroriente Block Gran Tierra Energy has entered into an agreement with Ecopetrol, the national oil company of Colombia, by which the parties renegotiated the terms and the duration of the contract for the Suroriente Block in the Department of Putumayo, which was scheduled to end in mid-2024. All dollar amounts are in United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe Agreement provides an opportunity to add significant value, as well as economic life, to Suroriente by continuing its duration for 20 years from the Agreement's effective date. The additional term of the contract allows long-term investment in infrastructure and work programs to enhance oil recovery efficiency in existing fields, and appraisal drilling to potentially prolong the life of the fields. Gran Tierra will continue to be the operator of Suroriente and is committing to a capital investment program of $123 million over a three-year period from the Agreement's effective date, expected to be funded by Gran Tierra's internal cash flow.\n\nThe Agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent including regulatory approval by the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce of Colombia ('SIC'). The satisfaction of such conditions precedent will determine the Agreement's effective date.\n\nGran Tierra became the operator of Suroriente in March 2019 with a 52% working interest ('WI'), with Ecopetrol holding the remaining 48% WI. Since becoming the operator, Gran Tierra has been able to increase 100% gross oil production from an average of 6,203 barrels of oil per day ('bopd') in February 2019 to an average of 8,167 bopd during first quarter 2023, an increase of 32%. The Company has also expanded the Cohembi enhanced oil recovery ('EOR') project, which is designed to increase the ultimate oil recovery and value of the block. Suroriente's first quarter 2023 average production of 8,167 bopd gross (4,247 bopd WI) was its second highest quarterly average production average since second quarter 2015, despite no development wells being drilled since first quarter 2018.\n\nThe Agreement further strengthens and consolidates Gran Tierra's position as a premier operator and the top contracted area holder in the Putumayo Basin and provides continuity to the Company's long-term business relationship with Ecopetrol. Gran Tierra is the operator of 100% of its Putumayo blocks. The Agreement is also consistent with Gran Tierra's focused strategy to grow the Company's reserves and its portfolio of development and exploration opportunities in the proven, underexplored Putumayo Basin, with access to established infrastructure.\n\nBy continuing the tenure of its operatorship of Suroriente, Gran Tierra expects to expand the EOR project in the block through long-term investments, which the Company forecasts to further increase value for all stakeholders. The capital commitment associated with the Agreement also aligns with the Company's preexisting long-term plans to develop Suroriente.\n\nGary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, commented: 'The Agreement represents a unique and significant opportunity in Colombia in terms of scale and upside potential while maintaining our long-term partnership with Ecopetrol in the prolific Putumayo Basin.

"France's Macron heckled by protesters on Netherlands visit Protesters disrupted French President Emmanuel Macron\'s speech in the Netherlands about Europe\'s future as he faces mass protests over pension reform back home.\n\nSecurity officials detained a demonstrator who shouted at Macron outside Amsterdam University on Wednesday in the latest disturbance during the French president\'s state visit to the Netherlands.\n\n""For the honour of the workers – even if Macron doesn\'t like it we are here,"" the protester shouted before he could be seen being pinned to the ground by several officers.\n\nFrance\'s leader is confronting the biggest challenge of his second term after pushing through his flagship pension overhaul, which includes raising the retirement age from 62 years to 64.\n\n""Where is French democracy?"" shouted banner-waving demonstrators as Macron addressed a largely student audience on Tuesday.\n\nThe protesters gathered in an upper tier of a theatre in The Hague and shouted, ""You have millions of protesters in the streets"" while holding up a banner that read ""President of Violence and Hypocrisy"".\n\nAfter security guards removed them, Macron said people who try to undermine laws passed by elected governments ""put democracy at risk"", citing the 2021 US Capitol riots and a 2023 attack on the Brazilian Congress.\n\nMacron\'s visit to the Netherlands was also clouded by a row over controversial comments he made about Taiwan.\n\nThe French president sparked controversy in recent days after he said in an interview Europe should not be ""followers"" of the United States or China when it came to Taiwan.\n\nThe remarks drew praise in China – which bristles at US support of what it sees as a breakaway province – but raised eyebrows among Western allies. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/frances-macron-heckled-by-protesters-on-netherlands-visit"
"LIVE: Warren Buffett talks his Japan bets, Berkshire Hathaway's unique culture, and the future of his company Warren Buffett is discussing his multibillion-dollar bets on five of Japan\'s biggest trading houses, and a range of other subjects, live from Tokyo in a CNBC interview today. We\'re live-blogging the conversation.\n\nThe famed investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO confirmed that he\'s raised his stakes in Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo to 7.4%. Berkshire originally disclosed roughly 5% positions in the five companies in August 2020, and bolstered them last November.\n\n6:51 a.m.: Abel says he spends more time at Berkshire Hathaway Energy than the BNSF Railway, as he has deep ties in the energy industry that lead to more opportunities. He also notes that Berkshire\'s 12 largest subsidiaries account for around 85% of the company\'s underlying cash flow, so he prioritizes spending his time helping the dozen largest businesses.\n\n6:47 a.m.: It\'s safe to say that Buffett won\'t want to overshadow Berkshire\'s shareholder meeting on May 6th by saying too much about Berkshire\'s non-Japanese investments. Thousands of shareholders travel to Omaha to hear Buffett and Munger answer questions on a broad range of topics during a marathon Q&A that usually lasts around six hours.\n\n6:45 a.m.: Berkshire\'s billionaire boss reflects on the challenges of the railroad business, from carrying hazardous chemicals to lethal incidents. Berkshire owns the BNSF Railway.\n\n6:40 a.m.: Buffett touts Berkshire\'s recent $8.2 billion purchase of a majority stake in Pilot Travel Centers, a gas-station business and previously one of the largest private companies in the US. He also underscores his faith in the company\'s incoming CEO, Adam Wright.\n\n6:24 a.m.: Buffett praises Abel for putting $100 million of his own money into Berkshire at the same terms as any other shareholder, with no discount or preferential terms. He underscores how rare that is in corporate America.\n\n6:23 a.m.: ""We\'ve got a unique organization which now has tremendous resources, and nobody can really copy our style,"" Buffett says, noting that Berkshire can say whether it\'s interested or not in acquiring a company in five minutes.\n\n6:20 a.m.: Berkshire famously has a decentralized, autonomous structure with a very small headquarters and scores of effectively independent subsidiaries. Buffett notes that while his managers enjoy their autonomy, they also get ""lonesome"" and Abel has bolstered communications with them.\n\n6:16 a.m.: Abel says he enjoys spending time with the 92-year-old investor and his 99-year-old business partner and Berkshire\'s vice-chairman, Charlie Munger.\n\n""He does all the work and I take the bows,"" Buffett jokes about Abel. ""The difference is he likes to work and I like to sit around.""\n\n""He\'s probably tougher than I would be in terms of getting things done,"" Buffett says. ""He\'s a big improvement on me but don\'t tell everybody.""\n\n6:13 a.m.: ""Iscar will never stop, Berkshire will be proud of it in 2050,"" Buffett says, referring to the Israeli metal cutting tools company owned by Berkshire.\n\n6:07 a.m.: Abel notes that he and Buffett have encouraged all of the Japanese companies to phone Berkshire with any potential business opportunities, and reassured them that Buffett will ""pick up the phone on the first ring"" and Berkshire will never run out of money.\n\n6:05 a.m.: Buffett confirms that Berkshire\'s sale of yen-denominated bonds is intended to ""insulate"" the company from exchange-rate risks. He notes that he and Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire\'s non-insurance operations and Buffett\'s planned successor as CEO, are meeting with the bosses of all five Japanese companies this week.\n\n6:00 a.m.: Buffett says he made his Japanese bets because the companies were big enough for Berkshire, he understood what they did, like Berkshire they were well-diversified with lots of different interests, and they were trading prices that were ""ridiculous"" relative to the prevailing interest rates at the time.\n\nRead more: Warren Buffett\'s Berkshire Hathaway faces a brutal mix of economic headwinds.

This was demonstrated in the recent significant award of a long-term agreement to support critical European offshore wind infrastructure.\n\n'Alongside converting a healthy pipeline of future opportunities – with a number of awards at preferred bidder stage – we are working to draw a line under the projects of the past, putting Petrofac in a strong position to deliver future growth. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-11963639/BUSINESS-LIVE-La-Rue-cuts-profit-forecasts-Sosandar-profit.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"Jeremy Renner makes triumphant 'Rennervations' premiere walk, says he won't torch his snowcat LOS ANGELES -- Months after nearly being killed in a snowplow accident, ""Avengers"" star Jeremy Renner triumphantly walked the premiere red carpet of his Disney  series ""Rennervations"" Tuesday. Using a cane for support, Renner even stopped to meet well-wishing fans.\n\nInside the Regency Village Theater, Renner rode a motorized scooter to the stage for a discussion with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, receiving a standing ovation from the audience.\n\n""What\'s with the scooter? Did something happen?"" Kimmel joked as Renner took his seat to discuss the series (which streams its first three episodes Wednesday).\n\nRenner was crushed by his 14,000-pound snowplow near his Nevada home on New Year\'s Day while trying to help free his nephew\'s car from the snow. He broke more than 30 bones while suffering a collapsed lung and pierced liver in the accident, the 52-year-old actor told Diane Sawyer last week in his first TV interview since the accident.\n\nJeremy Renner Diane Sawyer interview:Actor details snowcat accident, says \'it\'s my mistake and I paid for it\'\n\nSpeaking at Tuesday\'s premiere, executive producer Romilda De Luca said Renner immediately brought up ""Rennervations"" from the hospital intensive care unit after the near-fatal accident.\n\n""One of the first things Jeremy said is, \'Do not move the show,\'"" said De Luca.\n\nRenner used the premiere date to help inspire his extensive injury rehabilitation, which is still in process.\n\n""This show set the milestone for me to to get better, to make sure that all of our hard work wasn\'t for nothing,"" said Renner. ""There was no alternative. So for me, it was easy. There was somewhere to go, somewhere to point and I had a lot of love.""\n\nIn ""Rennervations,"" Renner and a team of expert builders reimagine decommissioned vehicles and rebuild them into unique and practical creations that serve communities around the world.\n\nThe accident:Jeremy Renner was run over by a snowplow while helping nephew with car trouble\n\nKimmel, who had the first late-night interview since the accident with Renner this week, jokingly asked if the actor would ""repurpose that (expletive) snow blower or something?""\n\n""It\'s a snowcat,"" Renner said, adding that his mother ""wants to light it on fire and have a big old party."" But that wasn\'t going to happen.\n\n""I love this thing and it\'s a necessity with these giant snowstorms,"" Renner added. ""I just need to learn how to drive it better.""\n\nRenner gave thanks to his family, including his 10-year-old daughter Ava, and friends in the premiere audience, who had made his improbable recovery from the accident a reality.\n\n""Some of the people who were part of saving my life and keeping me alive to breathe are here,"" said Renner, breaking up with emotion. ""A lot of people are here to support the living part of this. That starts with my family and my daughter.""\n\nHis recovery:Jeremy Renner shares adorable note from nephew after snowcat accident: \'Very lucky that my uncle is alive\'\n\nRenner added that his daughter came up with an ""awesome"" future ""Rennervations"" project.\n\n""It\'s an ambulance and she wanted to turn it into a mobile pet adoption clinic,"" said Renner. ""She drew up the plans and it\'s amazing.""\n\nRenner\'s show co-host, business partner and friend Rory Millikin said that a positive side of the terrible ordeal is that more people are learning about Renner and the good work of ""Rennerverations.""\n\n""Jeremy is a very private person, but for the first time you get to see what a big heart he has,"" said Millikin. ""He\'s doing this show to inspire people to look around their neighborhood and help organizations. That you can have an impact even if you\'re not a superhero. That\'s the show\'s message.

Another big inning brought Arraez to the plate in the eighth, and now, he had the easiest type of hit necessary to get the cycle.\n\nWith Andrew Bellatti on the mound, Arraez again went opposite field to find grass in left, thus becoming the first Marlin to hit for the cycle.\n\nArraez's .316 average was atop the AL last season – he distanced himself from Aaron Judge, who hit a new AL record 62 home runs yet still hit .311 and drove in 131 runs, tied for the most in the majors.\n\nLuis Arraez of the Miami Marlins reacts after his double against the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park on April 11, 2023, in Philadelphia.

"Botswana threatens break-up with De Beers in push for better deal Analysts saw this deal as a way for Botswana to loosen the Anglo American-owned miner\'s grip on its diamond sector, a major source of employment and tax revenue for the country.\n\nDe Beers and Botswana jointly own Debswana, which mines almost all of the roughs gems in the country -- the world\'s second-largest diamond producing nation after Russia.\n\nThe partnership has helped Botswana become one of Africa\'s fastest growing economies, while supplying De Beers 75% of Debswana\'s rough diamonds, which are then sorted and sold to sightholders around the world.\n\nDebswana\'s diamond sales hit a record $4.6 billion in 2022, compared to $3.4 billion in 2021.\n\nPresident Mokgweetsi Masisi has threatened to walk away from the talks if Botswana does not get a larger share of Debswana\'s output for marketing outside the De Beers system.\n\nThe government has not publicly stated what share it seeks, but it is believed to be as high as 50%, double its current allocation.\n\nThe two parties have been negotiating for several years to extend their 2011 mining rights and sales agreement, which is due to expire in June this year.\n\nRafael Papismedov, co-founder of HB Antwerp, told the Financial Times that a revised deal would help Botswana break free from the current model of being ""stuck in a box that says you can only dig and wash the diamonds"".\n\nPapismedov added that De Beers\' operating model carries on ""colonization"" principles, acting as if Botswana was incapable of building midstream capabilities for polishing diamonds.\n\nMasisi wants more locals employed in the diamond sector, which accounts for a fifth of the country\'s gross domestic product.\n\nThe largest diamond producer by value has said it is confident that it can maintain its partnership with Botswana, but that some of the negotiations are complex and require more time.\n\nDe Beers has said that the arrangement must make economic and strategic sense for both parties, adding that it is committed to supporting Botswana\'s aspirations to grow its diamond industry.\n\nThe stakes are high for both sides, as they seek to secure their future in a volatile and competitive industry that has been hit by the covid-19 pandemic, changing consumer preferences and ethical concerns.\n\nA new deal between Botswana and De Beers could have significant implications for the global diamond supply chain and the balance of power in the sector. https://www.mining.com/botswana-threatens-break-up-with-de-beers-in-push-for-better-deal/"
"India says Ukraine seeking medical, war recovery assistance India says Ukraine has asked for more medicines and medical equipment and has invited Indian companies to help rebuild the country.\n\nUkraine made its request during a four-day visit to India by First Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Emine Dzhaparova, which ended on Wednesday, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n\nDzhaparova\'s visit was the first by a high-ranking official from Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of her country in February last year.\n\nDzhaparova held talks with India\'s junior foreign minister, Meenakshi Lekhi, and handed over a letter from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the ministry said.\n\nThe statement gave no details about what the letter said.\n\n""Rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies,"" the ministry cited Dzhaparova as saying.\n\nIndia has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, including drugs and medical equipment. India also plans to supply school buses to Ukraine, the Indian ministry said.\n\nDzhaparova proposed that rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies, its statement said.\n\nIndia ""can play a bigger and greater role"" and Ukraine would ""welcome any effort that is directed at resolving the war"", she said in a speech on Tuesday at the Indian Council of World Affairs, a think tank in New Delhi.\n\nThe two countries agreed to hold their next round of foreign ministry consultations in Kyiv on a mutually convenient date, the Indian foreign ministry said.\n\nIndia has not been as critical of its old ally Russia over its invasion of Ukraine as some other countries, and it has increased its purchases of discounted Russian oil while maintaining high-level contacts with Moscow.\n\nIndia has sought a diplomatic solution to the conflict while Modi, in comments seen as mildly critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, told him in September that now was ""not an era of war"".\n\nDzhaparova, in comments to the media during her visit, said Ukraine wanted India to be more involved in helping resolve the conflict and Ukraine looked forward to welcoming Modi to Kyiv ""one day"".\n\nThe diplomat made her visit to India at a time when it holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 (G20).\n\nDzhaparova said Kyiv expected India to invite Ukrainian officials to the bloc\'s events and Zelenskyy is eager to address a G20 summit in New Delhi in September as he did by video during the group\'s most recent summit in Indonesia.\n\nThe Indian ministry did not refer to these requests in its statement.\n\nIndia does not want the war to overshadow G20 events, Indian officials have said, but the first two G20 ministerial events that India hosted, in February and March, saw rifts over the war between Group of Seven nations on one side and Russia and China on the other. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/india-says-ukraine-seeking-medical-war-recovery-assistance"

"Leaked Pentagon documents: What are the major takeaways? A series of leaked documents, purporting to contain highly classified Pentagon intelligence related to the war in Ukraine and information gathering on close allies of the United States, have emerged online in recent weeks.\n\nThe Pentagon has confirmed that the military documents ""appear to contain sensitive and highly classified material"", but the defence department has skirted categorical claims over the authenticity of the documents while repeatedly stressing that at least some have been doctored.\n\nHere is the latest about the leaked documents, which have not been verified.\n\nA leaked classified US military document suggests that 97 special forces personnel from NATO countries were active in Ukraine during February and March of this year.\n\nMedia outlets, including the BBC and The Guardian, reported that a document dated March 23, 2023, indicates that more than half of the Western special forces deployed in Ukraine are from the United Kingdom.\n\nBritain\'s Ministry of Defence on Tuesday warned against taking allegations contained in the reported leak of US classified information at ""face value"".\n\nIn response to the leak of alleged classified US information: pic.twitter.com/WWFLOhbeeU\n\n-- Ministry of Defence    (@DefenceHQ) April 11, 2023\n\nUK special forces conducted training with Ukrainian military forces in 2021. However, the UK government has not publicly disclosed whether special forces have been active in the country since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\n\nAccording to the leaked documents, Latvia – a country with a population of fewer than two million people – had 17 personnel, the second highest number of special forces deployed in Ukraine out of the NATO countries. The US and France had 14 and 15 special forces personnel respectively in Ukraine, while the Netherlands has one.\n\nThe document reportedly does not state where the allegedly deployed forces are located or what they are doing. It is also unclear whether the personnel numbers have been maintained at this level.\n\nAccording to another leaked Pentagon document, dated March 2, Serbia, which has refused to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, agreed to supply arms to Kyiv and may have sent them already.\n\nThe document summarises European governments\' responses to Ukraine\'s requests for military training and ""lethal aid"" or weapons. It was labelled NOFORN, which means it was not allowed to be distributed to foreign intelligence services and militaries.\n\nThe leak also reveals that Serbia declined to provide training to Ukrainian forces.\n\nSerbia\'s Defence Minister Milos Vucevic on Wednesday dismissed reports that Belgrade agreed to supply arms to Kyiv or has sent them already. Calling the intel ""untrue"", he added: ""Serbia did not, nor will it be selling weapons to the Ukrainian nor the Russian side, nor to countries surrounding that conflict.""\n\nSerbia, which relies on Russia for its energy, has sought to maintain its ambition to join the European Union while keeping its relations with Russia since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.\n\nOne leaked document, dated February 17 and obtained by The Washington Post, appeared to show that Egypt planned to supply Russia with rockets and munitions.\n\nAccording to the leak, Egypt\'s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is said to have instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West"".\n\nEgypt is one of the world\'s top recipients of US military aid, receiving $1.3bn in military financing annually.\n\nAn unnamed Egyptian state official called the document ""informational absurdity"" and said that Egypt follows a ""balanced policy"" with all international parties according to the state-affiliated media outlet, Al Qahera News.\n\nSeveral leaked documents appear to reveal US espionage tactics in relation to the war in Ukraine.\n\nIf proven authentic, they show that the US had been monitoring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\'s calls with defence and military officials. They also reveal apparent weaknesses in the Ukrainian air defence systems and the size of military battalions.\n\nThey also suggest that the US had penetrated the Russian military forces and the Wagner Group, a mercenary organisation, much more than previously understood.\n\nAnother purported highly classified Pentagon document reveals Russian operatives were building a closer relationship with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which hosts important US military installations. The UAE rejected the allegations, calling them ""categorically false"".\n\nOther leaks have concerned allegations that South Korean leaders were hesitant to ship artillery shells to Ukraine and that Israel\'s Mossad spy service opposed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\'s proposed overhaul of the judiciary.\n\nUS intelligence analysts believed a recent military parade in North Korea ""probably oversells"" the threat its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) pose to the United States, according to another leaked document.\n\nThe leak may have started on a site called Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games.\n\nThe US Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the incident. Top US officials acknowledge publicly that they are still trying to find answers.\n\n""They were somewhere in the web, and where exactly, and who had access at that point, we don\'t know. We simply don\'t know,"" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said.\n\nThe Pentagon has begun an internal review to assess the leaks\' impact on national security. Officials are also closely monitoring where the leaked slides are ""being posted and amplified,"" said Chris Meagher, assistant to the US secretary of defense for public affairs.\n\nSeparately, the US Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into how the slides were obtained and leaked.\n\nCIA Director William Burns on Tuesday called the leak ""deeply unfortunate"".\n\n""It\'s something that the US government takes extremely seriously,"" he said in remarks at Rice University. ""The Pentagon and the Department of Justice have now launched a quite intense investigation to get to the bottom of this. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/leaked-pentagon-documents-what-are-the-major-takeaways"

On the contrary, PGA Tour members make their living on the course based on where they finish at each tournament.\n\nThose in LIV are banned from playing in PGA Tour-sanctioned events, but majors, including the Masters, are their own entities.

"Warren Buffett Praises Greg Abel for Doing 'All the Work' at Berkshire Detailed minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting last month due out Wednesday may show just how close the central bank came to postponing further interest rate increases following the failure of two U.S. banks in the days leading up to the session. The Fed ultimately raised the benchmark federal funds rate a quarter of a point at its March 21-22 meeting, a policy gathering held less than two weeks after a tense weekend that top U.S. officials spent designing emergency measures to halt a possible deposit run against regional lenders following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. At a press conference following the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a pause was considered, but policymakers ultimately judged they could respond to different problems with different tools: higher interest rates to continue fighting inflation while relying on oversight and liquidity programs to keep the financial system stable. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-praises-greg-abel-104316417.html"

"NEW AI CHATBOT DELIBERATELY TRAINED TO BE AS STUPID AS POSSIBLE – SkyMagzines As impressive as they are, sometimes AI chatbots like ChatGPT can be really, really dumb.\n\nLeaning into that dumbness, and away from the potentially terrifying and easily abused power of an amoral intelligence hooked straight into the internet, is a goofy little chatbot called ""2dumb2destroy.""\n\nInstead of ginormous datasets, it\'s trained on crap like all seven ""Police Academy"" movies, Pauly Shore features, Ralph Wiggum quotes, and a bunch of other useless schlock.\n\nAnd thankfully, as its name suggests, it\'s probably too incompetent to ever do humanity any harm.\n\n""Everyone\'s talking about AI right now, and our impulse is, how can we make this stupid?"" its co-creator Steve Nass told BuzzFeed News.\n\nMaking a dumb bot, though, still requires some smarts. Nass and his friend Craig Shervin built 2dumb2destroy off OpenAI\'s GPT-3\n\nIn addition to force-feeding it silly quotes from the ""Naked Gun"" movies and ""Zoolander,"" they also trained it on some real life things, like George W. Bush\'s bumbling speeches and the sagacious exchanges that take place on the forums of Bodybuilding dot com.\n\n""It seemed like people just needed a funny, dumb [chatbot] that people could interact with that didn\'t have big consequences,"" Shervin told BuzzFeed.\n\n""With so much talk of AI going to steal people\'s jobs -- especially advertising writers\' -- people are having an existential crisis: Are we needed?"" he reasoned. ""We thought, \'Let\'s make an AI so stupid it can never threaten to steal anyone\'s job or [cause] any existential crisis.\'""\n\nWe can confirm that the bot can be pretty funny, and, indeed, dumb.\n\n""What do you think of ChatGPT?"" we asked 2dumb2destroy.\n\n""I think ChatGPT is very good for people who don\'t have friends.""

"Jayland Walker: Ohio Grand Jury Weighs Evidence in Death of Akron Man Here's what to know.\n\nThe police said they tried to stop Mr. Walker, who had one traffic ticket and no criminal record, shortly after midnight on June 27 for an equipment violation and a traffic violation. After Mr. Walker did not pull over, the police chased after him in their vehicles for more than seven minutes.\n\nIn footage of the chase, a popping sound can be heard, and a police officer reports gunfire coming from Mr. Walker's car. A shot is not visible in the footage, but at a news conference the Police Department showed footage from outside the car that appeared to capture a muzzle flash coming from Mr. Walker's driver's-side door.\n\nMr. Walker, wearing a ski mask, got out of his car through the front passenger-side door and fled on foot as the officers chased him into a nearby parking lot. The officers shouted at Mr. Walker with their weapons drawn and tried unsuccessfully to use their stun guns on him before they began firing their guns. As the officers opened fire, Mr. Walker fell to the ground.\n\nSeveral days later, the police said at a news conference that a handgun had been found in Mr. Walker's car. A bullet casing was found where they said he had fired, and the police said it was consistent with the weapon that was recovered from Mr. Walker's vehicle.\n\nThe officers were placed on administrative leave in the days after the shooting. The Police Department released body camera footage of the shooting on July 3, 2022, setting off a number of protests in Akron, a city of about 200,000 people in northeastern Ohio, just south of Cleveland. https://www.nytimes.com/article/jayland-walker-grand-jury-akron.html"

"Sarah Paulson financially helped friend Pedro Pascal early in his career Pedro Pascal and Sarah Paulson are two of Hollywood\'s most in-demand actors, often pictured at red carpet events together, but that hasn\'t always been the case during their three decades-long friendship.\n\nAs young actors struggling to navigate the industry, Paulson would help her friend make ends meet.\n\n""There were times when I would give him my per diem from a job I was working on so that he could have money to feed himself,"" she told Esquire magazine in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nThe pair first met when Pascal was studying at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts in 1993 and befriended a group of recent LaGuardia High graduates, a group that included Paulson.\n\n""We would go to see movies all the time in those years, and we would get so lost in them,"" Paulson told Esquire. ""You can fill in the blanks about the why of that however you like, but I think there were things we wanted to escape mentally, emotionally, spiritually.""\n\nTheir friendship has endured, with glimpses of it appearing on their respective Instagram pages and during red carpet events, such as the 2016 SAG Awards. Paulson even featured in Pascal\'s SNL debut two months ago, appearing in a sketch that poked fun at their internet personas of ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy.""\n\nHosting SNL was the latest confirmation that Pascal\'s career has exploded into the stratosphere.\n\nThe 48-year-old is currently fronting two blockbuster TV series – playing Joel in HBO\'s ""The Last of Us"" and the title character on Disney \'s ""The Mandalorian."" He will star in Pedro Almodóvar\'s new film ""Strange Way of Life"" alongside Ethan Hawke later this year.\n\nBut, after graduating NYU in 1997, Pascal struggled to definitively break into the industry. He appeared in an episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and three episodes of ""Undressed,"" waited tables at several New York restaurants, and auditioned for commercials and films.\n\n""I died so many deaths,"" Pascal recalled. ""My vision of it was that if I didn\'t have some major exposure by the time I was 29 years old, it was over, so I was constantly readjusting what it meant to commit my life to this profession, and giving up the idea of it looking like I thought it would when I was a kid. There were so many good reasons to let that delusion go.""\n\nPascal\'s unconventional career trajectory and surrogate father role in ""The Last of Us"" have earned him the internet\'s adoration, and the sexually-charged title of ""Daddy"" – the hashtag ""PedroPascalDaddy,"" has more than 8.2 billion views on TikTok alone.\n\n""He\'s a part of some spectacularly successful things,"" Paulson added. ""But sometimes in those situations, the show is the superstar.

"We&#39;ve raised AI just like we raised some children A couple of weeks ago I wrote that fears that ""AI will kill us"" are exagerated, being fears about something that ""literally ceases to exist the moment anyone pulls the plug off the computers it runs on. AI itself cannot ""kill"" anything more real than avatars in some simulation. AI is the most vulnerable, helpless thing ever.""\n\nBy pure chance, yesterday I found a post discussing exactly ""why we can\'t just unplug it: by the time we discover it is a superintelligence it will have spread itself across many computers and built deep and hard defenses for these. That could happen for example by manipulating humans into thinking they are building defenses for a completely different reason.""\n\nPersonally, an AI free to ""spread itself across many computers"" seems to me just a sub-case of, quoting myself again, ""[giving] a computer running any AI software full, direct, unchecked control on bacteriological labs, nuclear missiles silos or anything like that... it would be US who killed us, NOT AI, and we\'d deserve it.""\n\nThis said, today I want you to know that in that same post Albert Wenger says something great.\n\nSays Wenger that, as far as AI existential risks are concerned,\n\n""The key here will be to invert the approach to training that we have taken so far. It is absurd to expect that you can have a good outcome when you train a model first on the web corpus and then attempt to constrain it via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).""\n\n""This is akin to letting a child grow up without any moral guidance along the way and then expect them to be a well behaved adult based on occasionally telling them they are doing something wrong.""\n\nThe first sentence is so right and obvious that I am sad I did not write it myself, but it\'s the second sentence that really struck me. Because it immediately brought back to my memory a concern read years ago that... ""modern parenting is making monsters"" (emphasis mine):\n\n""To make children constantly choose is to abdicate one\'s responsibility for being a parent... It used to be that childhood operated under instruction... [Today, instead,] an important aspect of our culture of choice is that it absolves people (INCLUDING PARENTS) of a responsibility of care towards others. To put it another way, our culture of choice contains this message: I am not responsible for you because you are responsible for you.""\n\nThis is not a new problem, of course. In 2023, one of the first results of a search for news about ""parent abdication"" is a reminder that:\n\n""even after repeated disappointments the parental duty to try remains. Failure after good-faith efforts can be excused. A failure even to try can\'t be.""\n\nwhich is thirty years old, and isn\'t even the oldest one since ""When the Parent Abdicates‐Children Who Take on Adult Roles"" is from 1978. Other results from similar searches include:\n\n""Emotionally absent parents deprive their children of the possibility of building intimate and ""valuable relationships with others""\n\nChildren of such parents are ""often confused about what\'s right or wrong)""\n\nChildren of uninvolved parents ""don\'t know how to handle people and relationships""\n\nKids with neglectful parents may have ""trouble forming healthy relationships""\n\n[Uninvolved Parenting] makes it difficult to learn appropriate behaviors and limits in social situations\n\nLast but not least, allow me to include two paragraphs are from ""The Disappearing Child, written by Neil Postman in 1983:\n\n""[There is today a] conception of ""child\'s rights"" [that] rejects adult supervision and control of children and provides a ""philosophy"" to justify the dissolution of childhood. It argues that the social category ""children"" is in itself an oppressive idea and that everything must be done to free the young from its restrictions.""\n\n""This view is in fact [very old], for its origins may be found in the Dark and Middle Ages when there were no ""children"" in the modern sense of the word.""\n\nReplace ""children"" with ""chatGPT and similar programs"" and ""parents"" with ""managers of said programs"" and all the statements above make at least as much sense as before, and all point back to Wenger\'s advice, don\'t they? Not to mention that if Postman\'s statements do also apply to AI, the Metaverse isn\'t the only apparently modern thing that is reactionary, rather than innovative.\n\nNow, please do NOT take what follows as an accusation towards anybody\'s specific parent! After a while, everybody is personally responsible for his or her actions period, and to some extent we are all guilty of the current state of things, by inaction if nothing else. This is just an invitation to think (and act) about this thought that right now is stuck in my brain:\n\nIf we have certain problems with Artificial Intelligence it might just be because, as a society, we managed AI training just like we\'ve been (not) managing or supporting parenting, for at least two generations if you look at the dates of those statements. And when I look at the companies driving AI now I find hard to not see some of their managers as kids who, stealing Wenger\'s words, were let ""grow up without any moral guidance along the way and now are expected to be a well behaved adult based on occasionally telling them they are doing something wrong"". Please note that I said managers, not developers or researchers! What do YOU think?\n\nComparisons of AI training with human parenting aren\'t intellectual exercises. Before explaining why I say so, consider this AI-powered, ""neglectful parenting on steroids"" scenario:\n\nHalf a generation from now, baby Shan comes home to a crib attached to a sleek black box, containing an AI that monitors all her vital signs thanks to advanced biotelemetry sensors\n\nAs the weeks pass, the black box starts singing soothing lullabies to baby Shan, comforting her when she cries, and generally interacting with Shan, its AI learning and adapting to her needs, becoming a constant Companion, talking to her.\n\nAs Shan grows into a toddler, the AI in the black box is transferred to a Companion teddy bear, which runs around with her.\n\nAs Shan starts school, the Companion is seamlessly integrated into a wristwatch that she wears.\n\nBy the time Shan is an adult, she has had a lifetime with a Companion that has always acted in her best interest, been infinitely patient, stayed a confidant, and whom she has trusted her entire life.\n\nThis begs two questions:\n\nCompanion? That ""Companion"" is by far the closest thing to the Daemons of ""His Dark Materials"" that our reality may ever get! Trouble is, those Daemons were ""physical manifestation of a human soul"", while Shan\'s ""Companion"" could only be a digital simulation of a foster parent, no matter how ""real"" it would seem to its assigned human. Considering what such a Companion may be if initially developed ""without moral guidance etc..."" is left as exercise for the reader. Please comment!\n\nSmart voice assistants for dumber children are already here\n\nso are TikTok companions that ""feel raw and real"" for hardly the most reassuring reasons...\n\nor chatbots that ""worm their way into our hearts""...\n\nor fascinating companions way earlier than they should\n\nLast but not least... Just today, in order to overcome the information overload for new parents, a software developer asked if he should implement, the following solution:\n\ntransfer verified information handpicked by childcare and parenting experts to an AI, so that\n\nparents can ask that AI what they need via chat or voicemail\n\nwhen we\'re not quite sure what the AI thinks we should do, we should also be able to easily ask other parents for opinions on the subject with a click of a button. Something like, ""Look at this post from AI, do you think this is good advice?""\n\nIf you ask me, Point 3 seems the weakest part of the plan, both in the short and the long term: why on Earth should inexperienced parents ask advice to other inexperienced parents, instead of the childcare and parenting experts of Point 1? Shouldn\'t that be the first connection to facilitate?\n\nIn the long term... what happens when that solution kills itself, as it very likely will? Why should parents raised with AI support since day 1, be it chatbots or baby Shan\'s ""Companion"", ever feel the need to ask ""Look at this post from AI, do you think this is good advice?""\n\nIn general, let\'s follow Wenger\'s advice: ""invert the approach to AI training taken so far"", please. To parents, I strongly suggest (*) to be very, very, very careful with any ""experiment"" with AI and parenting, for at least two reasons:\n\ndatafication of childhood is an extraordinary complex and messy process, already advanced both at home and in schools\n\nAny experiment of this kind takes at least two generations to evaluate. You may have some certainty that something was ""good advice"" to raise your children only when their parenting gives you decent adult grandchildren\n\n(*) AI should be taken more seriously, and parenting a bit less dramatically. But how parents should cope with a digital society is one of the main themes of this newsletter, so subscribe to know more, and help me to share more! https://mfioretti.substack.com/p/weve-raised-ai-just-like-we-raised"
"Social Engineering Attacks Using Generative AI Increases by 135% According to a recent report by cyber security firm Darktrace, social engineering attacks leveraging generative AI technology have skyrocketed by 135%. AI is found to be used to hack passwords, leak sensitive information, and scam users across various platforms. Cybercriminals are now turning to advanced AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Midjourney to make their malicious campaigns more believable. This makes it difficult for users to distinguish between legitimate communications and well-crafted scams.\n\nAlso Read: The Dark Side of AI Innovation: ChatGPT Bug Exposes User Payment Data\n\nThe evolving nature of social engineering attacks has led to a surge in concern among employees. A staggering 82% of them expressed their fears about the realism of scams and the likelihood that more users could fall prey to these deceptions. Gone are the days when poor English was a clear red flag, as ChatGPT has significantly eliminated such apparent indicators.\n\nThe combination of advanced linguistic complexity and the ease of access to generative AI platforms creates a perfect storm for cybercriminals looking to exploit unsuspecting individuals. With social engineering attacks becoming increasingly harder to detect, users must remain vigilant to safeguard their personal information.\n\nAlso Read: Navigating Privacy Concerns: The ChatGPT User Chat Titles Leak Explained\n\nOne telltale sign of a potential scam or phishing attempt is an email requesting users to click on a link and enter login details. Users should be cautious about such emails and verify their authenticity before providing sensitive information.\n\nA recent study from Home Security Heroes revealed that 51% of common passwords could be cracked within a minute with the help of AI. The accuracy of AI-driven password cracking can increase to 81% in less than a month. The study used PassGAN, an AI password cracker, to test the duration it takes for AI to crack passwords from the RockYou dataset.\n\nTo combat the growing threat of AI-powered social engineering attacks, users must be increasingly vigilant and adopt better security practices. These practices include strong password creation and regular updates. As AI technology continues to evolve, it becomes more critical for individuals to stay informed and protect themselves from potential cyber security threats.\n\nAlso Read: Data Security in the AI Era   Expert Opinion\n\nTo protect against AI-driven social engineering attacks and maintain a high level of personal cyber security, individuals should adopt a multi-layered approach that includes the following best practices:\n\nUtilize strong, unique passwords for all accounts and avoid using common words, phrases, or patterns. Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Password managers can be valuable tools for generating and storing secure passwords.\n\nWhenever possible, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security. As it requires both a password and a verification code typically sent to a user\'s mobile device.\n\nDo not click on links or download attachments from unexpected or unfamiliar sources. Exercise caution when receiving emails or messages requesting personal information, even if they appear to be from legitimate organizations.\n\nRegularly update all software, including operating systems, antivirus programs, and applications. This helps to ensure that the latest security patches and features are installed.\n\nStay informed about the latest cyber security threats and trends. Share this knowledge with friends, family, and colleagues to help them understand the risks and best practices for staying safe online.\n\nIn conclusion, the rapid advancements in generative AI technology present opportunities and risks.

From bugs and glitches to moments of pure rage, I delve into the highs and lows of my gameplay experience, providing an unfiltered assessment of this highly anticipated title.\n\nCheck out my store – https://jakeydesigns.com\n\nGame Description: Atomic Heart is a first-person shooter video game with role-playing elements. The combat consists of shooting and slashing with improvised weapons. A wide variety of enemies are featured, which may be mechanical, biomechanical, biological, and some of which are airborne. A crafting system allows the player to piece weapons together from metal parts that can be detached from robots or taken from household appliances. Weapons can be upgraded via a mechanic called ""casettes"". Ammo in the game is scarce, and there is a stealth option. Quick-time events are featured in the game. The player wears a special glove, the Polymer Glove, which grants powers such as telekinesis, freezing, and electricity to defeat foes. Its powers can be combined with both melee and ranged weapons.\n\nAmmunition can be upgraded with various elemental effects using ""canisters"". These canisters can be looted and crafted, and equipped by the player on both melee and ranged weapons. If the canister depletes, it is discarded from the player\'s inventory.\n\n#AtomicHeart #VideoGames #Gaming #FPS #OpenWorld #Review #Critique #BadGame #Sucks #RageQuit #pcgamepass #gamepass\n\nTags: Atomic Heart,First Impressions,Bad Game,Sucks,Rage Quit,Video Games,Review,Critique,Gaming,FPS,Action,Adventure,Science Fiction,Futuristic,Robots,Artificial Intelligence,Story-Driven,Open World,PC Gaming,Steam,Negative Review,Disappointing,Unreal Engine,Glitches,Bugs,Performance Issues,Russian Game,Soviet Union,Alternate History,Conspiracy Theories,Dystopian,Cyberpunk,Post-Apocalyptic,Mystery,Suspenseful,Atmospheric,New Release,Indie Game,Unpopular Opinion https://www.fpshub.com/447260/atomic-heart-first-impressions-part-7-a-game-that-prioritizes-security-cameras-over-enjoyment/"
"Southern New Jersey wildfire has ballooned to 2,500 acres and prompted evacuations Dozens of buildings have been evacuated as a fast-moving wildfire raging in southern New Jersey swelled to 2,500 acres overnight and continues to threaten structures, officials said.\n\nThe blaze, dubbed Jimmy\'s Waterhole Fire, grew five times its size in about four hours after erupting in Manchester Township on Tuesday, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.\n\nJust before 10 p.m., it was at 500 acres and 10% contained. By about 2 a.m. Wednesday, the flames had ballooned to 2,500 acres while containment remained at 10%, tweets from the forest fire service show.\n\nThe fire is primarily burning on federal, state and private property in Manchester Township, but it has jumped to the nearby borough of Lakehurst.\n\nAbout 170 structures have been evacuated, and at least 75 more remain at risk from the fire, the forest fire service said.\n\nEvacuated residents are being sheltered at Manchester Township High School, and are being aided by local agencies.\n\n""Unfortunately, the weather won\'t be providing much help today. More warm, dry, and breezy conditions are expected. Next chance for rain is the weekend,"" the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey, said.\n\nThere\'s an elevated risk for wildfire spread across New Jersey and Delaware on Wednesday, with sustained winds up to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph expected. Low humidity and dry fuels are also contributing to the risk.\n\nIn addition to evacuations, there are mounting road closures in the area, including parts of Route 539 and Route 70, officials said.\n\nCNN Meteorologist Monica Garrett contributed to this report. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/weather/new-jersey-manchester-township-jimmys-waterhole-fire/index.html"

"From the Tax Law Offices of David W. Klasing - Tax Attorney vs. CPA: Why Not Hire a Dual Licensed Tax Attorney &amp; CPA? IRVINE, Calif., April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Tax issues can be complex. Knowing what type of expert is required to seek a resolution can be difficult. Generally, most issues can be addressed by either a Tax Attorney or a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).\n\nIt can be highly valuable to have your case analyzed by both a Tax Attorney and a CPA. However, hiring both types of tax professionals can be expensive. Fortunately, you can reach out to our law firm to consult with our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs. By evaluating your case from multiple perspectives, our legal team can more efficiently address the matter at hand.\n\nIf you have a tax issue that needs resolving, get help from our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs at the Tax Law Offices of David W. Klasing by dialing (800) 681-1295 or follow this link to schedule a reduced rate initial consultation via phone, in person at our Irvine Office or meet online via video using GoToMeeting.\n\nReasons to Hire Our Dual-Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs\n\nThere are many reasons to hire our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs. First, our team is likely qualified to address your tax needs without referring you to another firm. Accordingly, our clients do not run into expensive communication issues and disagreements & ego battles between their attorneys and their accountants.\n\nFurthermore, paying one firm is less expensive than paying two. By enlisting the services of our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs, you may deal with your tax issues without having to pay multiple parties. You can trust our team can handle all matters related to your tax needs.\n\nLastly, our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs have an in-depth understanding of tax law, business law, and accounting. Therefore, our legal team can analyze your case from multiple angles and quickly determine the tax strategy that needs to be employed.\n\nWhat Can Tax Attorneys and CPAs Do for You?\n\nOur Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs can perform multiple services for you. The following are some of the benefits each type of tax professional may be able to offer:\n\nCPAs have to complete an extensive amount of education, training & testing in order to become certified. These types of tax professionals often have extensive experience in areas like bookkeeping, taxation, business planning, and auditing. Accordingly, our CPA services can be very helpful when seeking to identify problem areas within your financial records and avoid potential issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nLike CPAs, Tax Attorneys must also complete copious amounts of education, training & testing to earn their licenses. CPAs typically focus on record-keeping. Meanwhile, Tax Attorneys can address issues related to high risk civil and criminal dispute resolution and long-term tax planning. For example, our Tax Attorneys are prepared to represent your interests during an eggshell audit, reverse eggshell audit, or criminal tax investigation. Our legal team can protect your interests, net worth, and your very liberty by defending against any civil or criminal tax exposure you may face.\n\nIf you have failed to file a tax return for one or more years or have taken a position on a tax return that could not be supported upon an IRS or state tax authority audit, eggshell audit, reverse eggshell audit, or criminal tax investigation, it is in your best interest to contact an experienced tax defense attorney to determine your best route back into federal or state tax compliance without facing criminal prosecution.\n\nNote: As long as a taxpayer that has willfully committed tax crimes (potentially including non-filed foreign information returns coupled with affirmative evasion of U.S. income tax on offshore income) self-reports the tax fraud (including a pattern of non-filed returns) through a domestic or offshore voluntary disclosure before the IRS has started an audit or criminal tax investigation / prosecution, the taxpayer can ordinarily be successfully brought back into tax compliance and receive a nearly guaranteed pass on criminal tax prosecution and simultaneously often receive a break on the civil penalties that would otherwise apply.\n\nIt is imperative that you hire an experienced and reputable criminal tax defense attorney to take you through the voluntary disclosure process. Only an Attorney has the Attorney Client Privilege and Work Product Privileges that will prevent the very professional that you hire from being potentially being forced to become a witness against you, especially where they prepared the returns that need to be amended, in a subsequent criminal tax audit, investigation or prosecution.\n\nMoreover, only an Attorney can enter you into a voluntary disclosure without engaging in the unauthorized practice of law (a crime in itself). Only an Attorney trained in Criminal Tax Defense fully understands the risks and rewards involved in voluntary disclosures and how to protect you if you do not qualify for a voluntary disclosure.\n\nAs uniquely qualified and extensively experienced Criminal Tax Defense Tax Attorneys, Kovel CPAs and EAs, our firm provides a one stop shop to efficiently achieve the optimal and predictable results that simultaneously protect your liberty and your net worth. See our Testimonials to see what our clients have to say about us!\n\nExamples of Issues Our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs Can Help With\n\nThere are many types of issues that our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs can help with. For example, our team can address any of the following issues in your case:\n\nBusiness Entity Selection\n\nVarious types of businesses will have differing tax obligations.

Our legal team can handle the selection and formation of the following types of businesses:\n\nBy choosing the correct business entity for you, you may effectively protect your personal assets and minimize your potential tax obligations. Call our law firm today for help identifying the type of business you wish to establish.\n\nBusiness Succession Planning\n\nAlmost every business owner has to determine how they want to exit eventually. This process is referred to as ""business succession planning."" There are two main ways to implement a succession plan. Generally, businesses may either be sold or gifted. When a business is gifted, the recipient is usually a family member or friend of the former owner.\n\nThere are many questions you may ask in order to determine which form of succession is right for your business. For example, any of the following circumstances may be analyzed before reaching a decision:\n\nMany estate planning tools may be utilized to transfer your business interest to a third-party purchaser, friend, or family member. After consulting with our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs, you can effectively form a business succession plan that is right for you.\n\nAssistance from our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs can be highly valuable when purchasing a business. Our legal team will analyze contracts, operational histories, valuation reports, and other financial records in order to ensure that a business is worth the value you are paying. Our attorneys can also determine whether there are any unpaid tax liabilities, pending lawsuits, or hidden off balance sheet risk that you should be aware of before purchasing a business. Accordingly, we strive to minimize the surprises after your transaction is complete.\n\nFBAR and FACTA Compliance\n\nAmericans who have offshore financial accounts or offshore income-generating assets must report these accounts and assets to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In order to comply with reporting requirements for foreign holdings, you must have a comprehensive understanding of the regulations outlined by the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA).\n\nIssues related to FBAR and FACTA compliance are often complex. Accordingly, guidance from our Dual Licensed International Tax Attorneys and CPAs can be invaluable to ensure that your rights and interests are protected.\n\nIf You Encountered a Tax Issue, Our Law Firm Can Help\n\nIf you have a tax issue that needs to be addressed, seek support from our Dual Licensed Tax Attorneys and CPAs at the Tax Law Offices of David W.

"After years of crisis, can China revive its lofty football goals? A year before the ardent football fan Xi Jinping became China\'s president, he had already made it clear that decades of underachievement in the sport by the world\'s most populous country had to end.\n\nIn 2011, Xi told a politician from South Korea, a much smaller neighbour with a much better footballing record, that he had three wishes: for China to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since its 2002 debut, then to host the tournament and, eventually, to win it.\n\nA detailed plan was announced in 2016 that set a target for China to become a top Asian football power by 2030 and a leading global force by 2050.\n\nFootball has not been a recent priority for Xi, who has had more pressing issues to deal with.\n\nLong after the rest of the world emerged from the global pandemic, the president\'s ""zero-COVID"" policy – aimed at stamping out the virus, rather than living with it – meant imposing some of the world\'s most restrictive lockdowns. The economy has also suffered a sharp downturn in recent years and football has been hit by a series of corruption allegations.\n\nIt has left Chinese football firmly in the doldrums.\n\n""No one mentions football superpower ambitions or long-term goals any more after tumultuous years in which COVID was not the only problem,"" Bi Yuan, a Beijing-based sports consultant, told Al Jazeera.\n\nWith China finally reopening its economy and borders as 2022 came to a close, and the new Chinese Super League (CSL) season kicking off on Saturday, some are wondering if the plans to make China a football superpower can be dusted off.\n\nChinese football was already facing financial issues before the coronavirus hit.\n\nMore than $1bn was spent in the previous decade on foreign stars such as Didier Drogba, Carlos Tevez and Nicolas Anelka and big-name coaches such as Marcello Lippi, Luiz Felipe Scolari and Fabio Capello as CSL became a major destination outside the big European leagues.\n\nIt culminated in the December-January transfer window of 2016-17 when CSL clubs spent about $400m on new signings, more than any other league in the world. Its profile had never been higher. But authorities in Beijing, concerned at the amounts being spent, introduced transfer taxes and salary caps.\n\nDebts caused by spending were soon compounded by wider economic woes.\n\nMore than half of the top-tier teams were owned by property developers who ploughed money into their clubs, hoping to gain political advantages from closer relations with regional or national authorities.\n\nTowards the end of the last decade, a slowdown in an overheated real estate market was starting to hit the bottom lines of many of these companies. Then the arrival of COVID was devastating.\n\nSince the end of 2019, games were played in mostly empty stadiums in centralised venues, hitting income from broadcasting and sponsorship.\n\nIn 2021, champions Jiangsu FC folded after its owners pulled their investment from the club. Other clubs such as Chongqing and Hebei struggled to pay players. Guangzhou FC, owned by debt-ridden Evergrande, whose investment brought eight Chinese titles and two Asian champions from 2011 to 2019, were relegated in December.\n\nIn March, eight clubs from the top three tiers – including Guangzhou City from the CSL – were disqualified from their leagues for various financial issues as the Chinese Football Association (CFA) looked to clean house.\n\nMeanwhile, the CFA was also rocked by strife. In February, CFA president Chen Xuyuan was arrested on corruption charges. Other officials are also reportedly under investigation for ""serious violations of laws"", including former national team coach Li Tie.\n\nAmid the crises afflicting the sport, Chinese clubs have floundered in recent continental competitions and a dismal Qatar 2022 World Cup qualification campaign saw the national team win just once in 10 games in the final round.\n\nMany have also pointed to the longstanding failure to develop high-quality young Chinese players.\n\n""Pre-pandemic, the authorities had already figured out that a focus on the long-term development of domestic talent is important, rather than buying expensive overseas stars,"" Simon Chadwick, professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told Al Jazeera.\n\nChen Xuyuan summed it up in 2020.\n\n""The expenditure of Chinese Super League clubs is about 10 times higher than South Korea\'s K-League and three times higher than Japan\'s J-League,"" he said. ""But our national team is lagging far behind.""\n\nTom Byer, an American coach now based in Japan, was hired by the CFA in 2013 to help Chinese football build stronger and deeper foundations.\n\n""The main strategy for Chinese football was implementing football throughout the schools,"" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe designed the technical curriculum for a programme aiming to create 50,000 football schools by 2025, spanning first grade right up to universities.\n\n""The biggest thing that stood out to me during my work for several years in China was the investment that went into education. The facilities at the school football programme schools are outstanding – much better than Japanese schools,"" he said.\n\nHe says much of the good work has since been undone.\n\n""It\'s been halted for the past few years,"" said Byer. ""Funding had been pulled along with the restrictions on people gathering.""\n\nThere is one silver lining. With less reliance on foreign players, there are now more opportunities for young domestic players as clubs have little choice to play them.\n\nGuangzhou FC, for example, fielded a team full of young local players last season.\n\nRegardless of who is wearing the shirt, there is a hunger among fans to get back into stadiums once the new season starts on Saturday.\n\n""Overall, Chinese fans are feeling relieved,"" said Bi ""After a time without hope, there is now something to look forward to.""\n\nThe return of fans also spells good news for struggling clubs.\n\n""It will help create conditions in which Chinese football can start to get back to where it was pre-pandemic,"" said Chadwick. ""People will be able to attend matches in large numbers and move around the country, which will have a tangible impact upon the likes of pre-match entertainment and football shirt sales.""\n\nBut the late announcement of the new season, coming just a week before it kicks off, has given clubs little time to organise tickets and they are scrambling to secure players.\n\n""The country and its officials now need to redouble their efforts if China is to become a leading FIFA nation by 2050,"" said Chadwick. https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/4/12/after-years-of-crisis-can-china-revive-its-lofty-football-goals"
"Strict EPA Emissions Proposal Would Mean Surge in EV Sales The U.S. EPA on April 12 proposed sweeping emissions cuts for new cars and trucks through 2032, a move the agency says could mean two out of every three new vehicles automakers sell will be electric within a decade.\n\nThe proposal, if finalized, represents the most aggressive U.S. vehicle emissions reduction plan to date, requiring 13% annual average pollution cuts. The EPA is also proposing new stricter emissions standards for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks through 2032.\n\nEPA projects the 2027-2032 model year rules would cut more than 9 billion tons of CO2 emissions through 2055 - equivalent to more than twice total U.S. CO2 emissions last year.\n\nThe agency estimates net benefits through 2055 from the proposal range from $850 billion to $1.6 trillion. By 2032 the proposal would cost about $1,200 per vehicle per manufacturer but save an owner more than $9,000 on average on fuel, maintenance, and repair costs over an eight-year period.\n\n""A lot has to go right for this massive - and unprecedented - change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,"" said John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation representing General Motors GM.N, Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, Toyota 7203.T and others.\n\n""Factors outside the vehicle, like charging infrastructure, supply chains, grid resiliency, the availability of low carbon fuels and critical minerals will determine whether EPA standards at these levels are achievable.""\n\nThe proposal is more ambitious than President Joe Biden\'s 2021 goal, backed by automakers, seeking 50% of new vehicles by 2030 to be electric vehicles (EVs) or plug-in hybrids. Stellantis said it was ""surprised that none of the alternatives align with the President\'s previously announced target of 50% EVs by 2030.""\n\nThe Biden administration is not proposing banning gasoline-powered vehicles but wants comments on whether it should extend emissions rules through 2035 and on other alternatives. Some environmental groups want EPA to set tougher rules, especially on heavy trucks.\n\n""These standards are very ambitious and they track with the sense of urgency that the president and this administration have as we tackle the climate crisis,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a Reuters interview, declining to endorse setting a date to end the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles. He emphasized the proposal is a ""performance-based standard"" and not an EV mandate.\n\nUnder the EPA proposal, automakers are forecast to produce 60% EVs by 2030 and 67% by 2032 to meet requirements - compared with just 5.8% of U.S. vehicles sold in 2022 that were EVs.\n\nCalifornia in August moved to require all new vehicles sold in the state by 2035 be electric or plug-in electric hybrids, but must still seek an EPA waiver to proceed. Regan would not say how the EPA would react to a California request. ""We\'ll be on the lookout for that if it were to ever come,"" he said.\n\nDan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said the EPA proposal should have been tougher.\n\n""Automakers talk out of both sides of their tailpipes, promising electric vehicles while delivering mostly the same old gas-guzzlers and lobbying for weak, loophole-riddled rules,"" Becker said.\n\nUnder the proposal, EPA estimates 50% of new vocational vehicles like buses and garbage trucks could be EVs by 2032, along with 35% of new short-haul freight tractors and 25% of new long-haul freight tractors. Medium-duty vehicle rules are projected to cut emissions by 44% over 2026. https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/strict-epa-emissions-proposal-would-mean-surge-ev-sales-204729"
"Insider Trading Policies: Key Compliance Dates for New Disclosures Thanks to Markel\'s Karl Strait for noticing that the SEC\'s ""Small Entity Compliance Guide"" for the new rules on insider trading arrangements and related disclosures confirms the compliance dates for the new exhibit requirement and other disclosures under Regulation S-K Items 408 and 402(x). I blogged earlier this year that Corp Fin Director Erik Gerding had shared thoughts on these dates – but it\'s great to see it laid out:\n\nSmaller reporting companies will be required to begin compliance with the:\n\n– Item 408(a) quarterly disclosure and tagging requirements in an Exchange Act report on Form 10-Q that covers the first full fiscal quarter (or on Form 10-K if the first full fiscal quarter is the issuer\'s fourth fiscal quarter) that begins on or after October 1, 2023; and\n\n– Item 408(b), Item 402(x), and Item 16J (for foreign private issuers) disclosure and tagging requirements in the annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F that covers the first full fiscal year that begins on or after October 1, 2023.\n\nCompanies that are not smaller reporting companies will be required to begin compliance with the:\n\n– Item 408(a) quarterly disclosure and tagging requirements in an Exchange Act report on Form 10-Q that covers the first full fiscal quarter (or on Form 10-K if the first full fiscal quarter is the issuer\'s fourth fiscal quarter) that begins on or after April 1, 2023; and\n\n– Item 408(b), Item 402(x), and Item 16J (for foreign private issuers) disclosure and tagging requirements in the annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F that covers the first full fiscal year that begins on or after April 1, 2023.\n\nRemember that the changes to Section 16 are also now in effect – requiring insiders to report gifts within two business days and indicate on the Form 4 cover page whether the transaction is occurring pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.\n\nThe Guide notes that it was prepared by the Staff as a ""small entity compliance guide"" under Section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, as amended.

"EQT Launches Forestry Management Program for Carbon Offset Initiative EQT Corp. is introducing its first nature-based carbon offset initiative in projects that will span more than 1,000 acres of forest at Oglebay, West Virginia, and other areas, the company said on April 10.\n\nEQT has partnered with Wheeling Park Commission, soil analytics company Teralytic and Climate Smart Environmental Consulting LLC to implement forest management projects that will generate carbon offsets. Wheeling Park owns Oglebay.\n\nTeralytic\'s soil probe technology will ensure the quantification of the offset is accurate and transparent, EQT said.\n\nThe partnership will implement conservation practice standards (CPS) outlined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and will align to nonprofit Verra\'s guidelines to ensure emissions reductions and removals are effective.\n\nEQT said the partnership will supplement its efforts to deliver low-cost, low-carbon, reliable energy. The initiative will reduce or remove emissions of CO2 from the atmosphere to offset other operational emissions and advance EQT\'s efforts to reach net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by or before 2025, EQT said.\n\nIn conjunction with the project, EQT said it also partnered with Wheeling Country Day School to pilot an educational learning program allowing students to learn about soil health by monitoring real-time changes in the health of the soil, 24 hours a day.\n\n""We are excited to take this first step in a partnership with EQT as the center of knowledge for forest improvement and soil health,"" said Wheeling Park Commission President and CEO Bob Peckenpaugh. ""We have served our community for 100 years, and for Oglebay to endure for another 100 years, we have a responsibility to the people of this community and the 2,000 acres we call home to clean up, maintain and improve our natural resources.""\n\nEQT said the soil technology provided by Teralytic will empirically measure the impact of the projects on soil health. Teralytic\'s probes are automated and take real-time measurements of soil carbon, soil moisture and other vital soil nutrients. EQT said the technology allows the company to generate higher quality carbon offsets at a lower cost than traditional methods.\n\nRob Wingo, EQT\'s executive vice president of corporate ventures, said the company has a long-standing commitment to reducing emissions from operations and already has some of the lowest GHG emissions intensities in the world.\n\n""Nature-based projects like this, which are supported by cutting edge technology that ensures accuracy and transparency, will help offset EQT\'s remaining emissions and advance our mission to deliver cheaper, more reliable, cleaner energy to the world,"" Wingo said. https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/eqt-launches-forestry-management-program-carbon-offset-initiative-204728"
"US Reduces Flaring and Flaring Intensity, The World Bank Says Last year, the U.S. reduced its flaring 9% and flaring intensity by 14% compared to the prior year, despite increasing oil production, according to a recent World Bank report.\n\nThe U.S. reduced flaring by 9% or 0.8 billion cubic meters (Bcm) in 2022 compared to 2021. U.S. producers also reduced its flaring intensity by 14% to 1.8 cubic meters of gas flared per barrel of oil produced (cm/bbl) in 2022 – the lowest value recorded in the past 10 years – compared to 2.1 cm/bbl in 2021, the World Bank said in its March 2023 edition of the Global Gas Flaring Tracker Report.\n\nFlaring intensity is a measure of the amount of gas flared per barrel of oil produced.\n\nThe reductions in 2022 came despite a 6% increase in U.S. oil production, the report said.\n\n""This suggests a continuation of the significant progress made by the U.S. to expand its integrated gas value chain and to commercialize more associated gas,"" the report said.\n\n""During 2022, there was also an increase in LNG export globally from the U.S. with a marked increase in the portion of those exports going to Europe from early 2022 onwards,"" the report said. ""The U.S. demonstrates the results that can be achieved when private companies (upstream, midstream and downstream) seek to capitalize on gas market opportunities and are supported by strong regulation on flaring.""\n\nAfter a decade of little progress globally, gas flaring volumes fell 3% worldwide to 139 Bcm in 2022, according to satellite-based estimates. That compares with flaring of 144 Bcm in 2021, according to the World Bank\'s report, which was produced jointly with the assistance of the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership.\n\nThree countries, Nigeria, Mexico and the U.S., accounted for most of the decline in global gas flaring in 2022.\n\n""However, despite this welcome reduction, greater and sustained efforts are needed to end this wasteful and polluting practice,"" the report said. ""The growing sense of urgency in tackling global gas flaring is further fueled by an increased concern regarding the amount of methane emitted during flaring.""\n\nThe top nine flaring countries continued to be responsible for the vast majority of flaring – 74% worldwide – while producing 45% of global oil production.\n\nThe top gas flaring nations, in order, are Russia, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Venezuela, the U.S., Mexico, Libya and Nigeria.\n\nThe World Bank said the reduction in global flaring volumes came about despite a 5% rise in oil production to 80 MMbbl/d in 2022 compared to 77 MMbbl/d in 2021.\n\n""This decoupling of gas flaring and oil production is notable and led to a reduction in the global average flaring intensity, the amount of gas flared per barrel of oil produced, to 4.7 m3/bbl in 2022 compared to 5.1 m3/bbl in 2021,"" the report said. https://www.hartenergy.com/exclusives/us-reduces-flaring-and-flaring-intensity-world-bank-says-204724"
"Instagram users are being targeted by bots in fake Shein gift card competitions Cybercriminals are using fake Shein gift cards to lure victims into handing over their bank details online.\n\nA new scam has taken Instagram by storm this month, with people across the world targeted in the money-grabbing trick.\n\nVirus detector, Avast, claims the con generally kicks off with a simple comment, congratulating users for winning a fashion retailer gift card.\n\nTo claim this, victims are encouraged to click the link in a scammer's page where they may be put under time pressure to answer a short survey.\n\nIn one example, users had just two minutes to answer questions like 'do you agree with the prices of products in SHEIN?' and 'How do you plan to use the SHEIN gift card?'.\n\nCriminals are now using fake Shein gift cards to lure victims into handing over bank details\n\nVirus detector, Avast, claims the con often kicks off with a simple congratulatory comment\n\nRegardless of your answers, it is understood that victims will always make it to the next stage, where they are presented with a screen filled with wrapped presents.\n\nThe site will then give users three chances to click on a prize-winning box.\n\nAvast claims the first one will always be empty, making the whole plot even more realistic.\n\nIt is understood that the Shein reward will always be given after the second box-click, with the scam site claiming that prizes range from £25 to £2,000.\n\nBut the scammers often claim they will need an address and postage payment to send out this gift card within a few days.\n\nThis is the point at which users are encouraged to hand over their personal details including a name, phone number, email and bank details.\n\nAs a result, Avast claims that victims unknowingly sign up to a subscription fee rather than a single postage payment.\n\nIn many countries, the charged amount is not disclosed, but for France it is €2 followed by €33 each fortnight - equivalent to £1.80 and £29.\n\nAmid the scam, social media has been flooded with comments, as some users claim they are being bombarded with gift card offers everyday.\n\nOne person tweeted: 'I've won about 14,000 Shein gift cards on Instagram this morning and the spam accounts tag you in every single one of them.'\n\nAnother joked: 'Why won't my landlord let me pay my rent in SHEIN gift cards I've won on Instagram,' while one person also said: 'The amount of SHEIN gift cards I've won on Instagram is unbelievable.'\n\nUsers may be put under time pressure to answer a short survey before the 'gift card' is finally handed over. Then, the site will then give users three chances to click on a prize-winning box. Avast claims the first one will always be empty, making the whole plot more realistic\n\nThe gift card scam is not the first to have targeted Shein-buyers, with other schemes also hooking victims with gift giveaways.\n\nLast year, Shein said: 'We are aware of a scam claiming to provide a credit card number for free SHEIN items. This is fake and in NO WAY endorsed by our company. Please be cautious when engaging online!'\n\nA few months later, they tweeted again: 'We have been made aware of recent email scams falsely claiming to come from our company, and can verify this is not an official SHEIN communication. Please feel free to confirm with us through our customer service channels at any time regarding official emails from SHEIN offer...'\n\nMailOnline has approached Shein for comment.\n\nTo protect yourself against scams, Instagram recommends that users should watch out for some key signs.\n\nIt is understood that the Shein reward will always be given after the second box-click, with the scam site claiming that prizes range from £25 to £2,000. Once payment details are entered, victims unknowingly sign up to a subscription rather than a single postage payment\n\nRed flags often include someone asking for money, offering to send money, gift cards or anything else.\n\nUnverified accounts that appear to represent large brands or public figures are also deemed untrustworthy, in addition to anyone asking for a fee to apply for a job.\n\nAny fraudulent requests may be written with poor spelling and grammar too, potentially from an account that is new to the platform.\n\nInstagram said: 'If you see something that you think is a scam, you should avoid responding and report the scam to Instagram.\n\n'Bear in mind that your report is anonymous, except if you're reporting an intellectual property infringement. The account you reported won't see who reported them.'\n\nAvast also added: 'When getting information from an Instagram account (or other social networks), look for signs that the account is original and authentic.\n\n'There are plenty of copycats and fraudulent accounts out there, but when looking closely, you'll almost always be able to spot signs pointing to the fact that they're ingenuine.'\n\nMailOnline has approached Instagram for comment.\n\nInstagram has launched a crackdown on fake accounts, introducing a new feature showing users information about who is really behind a username.\n\nThe Photo-sharing app' more than 1 billion users will now be able to evaluate the authenticity of accounts, weeks after parent Facebook rolled out similar measures in a bid to weed out fake accounts on its social media platform.\n\nThe 'About This Account' feature will allow users to see the advertisements an account is running, the country where the account is located, username changes in the past year as well as other details.\n\nTo learn more about an account, go to their Profile, tap the … menu and then select 'About This Account.'\n\nThere, you will see the date the account joined Instagram, the country where the account is located, accounts with shared followers, any username changes in the last year and any ads the account is currently running.\n\nInstagram also plans to significantly boost the number of verified accounts for public figures, celebrities, and global brands.\n\nAlong with the account username, applicants will need to provide full real names and a copy of legal or business identification.\n\nInstagram also said it will allow the use of third-party apps such as DUO Mobile and Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication to help users securely log in to their accounts. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11963919/Instagram-users-targeted-bots-fake-Shein-gift-card-competitions.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders meets team mascot and gets quite the surprise When football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders agreed to become head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes, he probably never thought he\'d be asked to stand in the way of an actual charging buffalo.\n\nBut that\'s what happened when Sanders went to meet the team\'s mascot – Ralphie – for the first time.\n\nIn a video released on social media by the Division 1 college team, Sanders can be seen being guided into Ralphie\'s trailer and meeting the buffalo.\n\nIt\'s safe to say that Sanders did not feel entirely comfortable with the company.\n\n""You see I\'m easing back,"" he said as he hesitated at the door.\n\n\'Prime Time\' was then encouraged to feed his new friend, donning a glove and being given a tutorial on how to keep his fingers safe.\n\n""Lord, that tongue is like a brick,"" Sanders exclaimed as the buffalo ate from his hand.\n\nThe meeting we\'ve all been waiting for  #CoachPrime   #GoBuffs pic.twitter.com/CCGi2rykTa\n\nSanders was drafted as a first-rounder in 1989 by the Atlanta Falcons out of Florida State and played in the NFL for 14 seasons with several franchises. He won two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nHe also played for five different Major League Baseball teams in 11 years and is the first athlete to have competed in a Super Bowl and a World Series.\n\nBut despite playing on the world stage on more than one occasion, his nerves were truly tested when Ralphie\'s handlers sprung a surprise.\n\nRalphie was taken out of the trailer before being encouraged to run back inside, where a rather nervous looking Sanders was waiting.\n\n""Oh no, I\'m not staying in here while this thing is coming at me at full speed,"" he shouted, before realizing it was too late to get out in time.\n\nIncredibly, Ralphie stopped her charge just in front of Sanders, as planned, before the head coach admitted that the whole experience had been somewhat ""intimidating.""\n\nHowever, mascot meetings don\'t always go to plan.\n\nIn 2019, ahead of the Texas Longhorns\' game against the Georgia Bulldogs in the Sugar Bowl, the team mascots – Bevo and Uga – were to have a heartwarming encounter.\n\nBut, this time, Bevo XV – the giant longhorn steer – was not keen on a friendly exchange with the much smaller bulldog and charged at his counterpart on the football field.\n\nFortunately, someone whisked the dog away just in time.\n\nThey do say to never work with animals, after all. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/sport/deion-sanders-colorado-buffaloes-mascot-spt-intl/index.html"

Primo Water operates largely under a recurring revenue model in the large format water category (defined as 3 gallons or greater). This business strategy is commonly referred to as ""razor-razorblade"" because the initial sale of a product creates a base of users who frequently purchase complementary consumable products. The razor in Primo Water\'s revenue model is its industry leading line-up of innovative water dispensers, which are sold through approximately 10,000 retail locations and online at various price points. The dispensers help increase household and business penetration which drives recurring purchases of Primo Water\'s razorblade offering or water solutions. Primo Water\'s razorblade offering is comprised of Water Direct, Water Exchange, and Water Refill. Through its Water Direct business, Primo Water delivers sustainable hydration solutions across its 21-country footprint direct to customers, whether at home or to businesses. Through its Water Exchange business, customers visit retail locations and purchase a pre-filled bottle of water. Once consumed, empty bottles are exchanged at our recycling center displays, which provide a ticket that offers a discount toward the purchase of a new bottle. Water Exchange is available in approximately 17,500 retail locations. Through its Water Refill business, customers refill empty bottles at approximately 23,500 self-service refill drinking water machines. Primo Water also offers water filtration units across its 21-country footprint.\n\nPrimo Water\'s water solutions expand consumer access to purified, spring, and mineral water to promote a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle while simultaneously reducing plastic waste and pollution. Primo Water is committed to its water stewardship standards and is proud to partner with the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) in North America as well as with Watercoolers Europe (WE), which ensure strict adherence to safety, quality, sanitation and regulatory standards for the benefit of consumer protection.\n\nPrimo Water is headquartered in Tampa, Florida (USA).

"Angel Reese is 'probably the greatest athlete ever to come out of LSU sports. Male and female. Ever,' says Shaquille O'Neal Shaquille O\'Neal knows a thing or two about success. The four-time NBA champion and one of the league\'s greats has walked the walk while also talking the talk.\n\nAnd so when he praises another athlete, it comes with some gravitas and expertise behind it.\n\nOn Tuesday, O\'Neal called Louisiana State University (LSU) forward Angel Reese the ""greatest athlete"" to come out of the school.\n\n""She\'s probably the greatest athlete ever to come out of LSU sports. You heard it here first,"" O\'Neal said on \'The Big Pod.\' ""Male and female. Ever.""\n\n""Because, guess what? She delivered. She delivered that package. See, a lot of us got the package, and we still got the package in our truck. She delivered that package. So, you know, there\'s a lot of names you could throw around – men and women – but she\'s probably the greatest athlete.\n\n""Some people are going to exclude it to women athletes. I\'m not doing that. She\'s the greatest athlete to ever come out of LSU.""\n\nReese had an excellent 2022 season as she played a pivotal role in LSU winning its first ever NCAA women\'s college basketball championship title.\n\nShe was named an unanimous first-team All-American for her performances this season, as well as being named the women\'s March Madness\' Most Outstanding Player.\n\nReese averaged 23 points, 15.4 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game over the course of LSU\'s season.\n\nHowever, it\'s arguable the 20-year-old\'s talents have been overlooked amid last week\'s controversy over whether Reese would visit the White House – traditionally, the national champions receive an invitation.\n\nReceiving praise from O\'Neal is high recognition, who himself had a stellar career at LSU before being drafted with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft.\n\nHe was twice named a first-team All-American and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men\'s basketball player of the year in 1991.\n\nO\'Neal later had his No. 33 retired at LSU, was inducted into the school\'s Hall of Fame as well as college basketball\'s Hall of Fame.\n\nLSU has a prestigious record of churning out talented athletes; from O\'Neal and fellow basketball Hall of Famer Pete Maravich to track and field star\'s Lolo Jones and Armand Duplantis.\n\nO\'Neal compared her to the success that current Cincinnati Bengals quarterback and LSU star Joe Burrow had at the school, winning the college football national championship title in 2019 as well as the Heisman trophy.\n\n""She is the greatest athlete to ever come out of LSU because she got it done. Joe Burrow got it done a couple of years ago, but she is way more athletic than he is,"" O\'Neal said. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/sport/shaquille-oneal-angel-reese-lsu-spt-intl/index.html"
"Hedge fund places record-breaking bet against NatWest By John-Paul Ford Rojas\n\nPublished: 19:51 EDT, 11 April 2023   Updated: 06:33 EDT, 12 April 2023\n\nA hedge fund has placed a record-breaking bet that NatWest shares will plummet as the global banking system comes under further strain.\n\nData from City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority showed London-based Marshall Wace had taken a 0.61 per cent short position in NatWest shares.\n\nIt was the largest short in NatWest stock reported to the FCA, under regulations in place since 2012, according to analysis by The Times, which first reported the position.\n\nBanking shares have come under pressure since a crisis enveloped US lenders including Silicon Valley Bank and European giant Credit Suisse.\n\nNatWest shares have fallen by 8 per cent since the crisis began around a month ago.\n\nData from City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority showed Marshall Wace had taken a 0.61 per cent short position in NatWest shares\n\nHowever, markets have been relatively calm since Credit Suisse's emergency rescue by its Swiss rival UBS.\n\nAnd analysts think major UK banks - which have been forced to be much more cautious since the 2008 crisis - are largely insulated from the problems.\n\nNatWest remains more than 40 per cent owned by the taxpayer after it was rescued during the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nEarlier this month, the Treasury pushed back its plan to sell down its holding in the bank by two years, to 2025, in response to the recent share price fall.\n\nSome links in this article may be affiliate links.

"Contractor installs bulletproof shelters at Alabama elementary school: 'I want it in every classroom' An elementary school in Alabama is using bulletproof safe rooms to protect students if there\'s an active shooter.\n\nCULLMAN, Ala. – An elementary school in Alabama has installed bulletproof safe rooms in two classrooms to protect students in the event of an active shooter.\n\nThe rooms were installed at West Elementary School in Cullman, Alabama, in late February as part of a pilot program. Since then, another school shooter killed three children and three adults at a private school in Nashville.\n\n""I want it in every classroom in the United States,"" Kevin Thomas told Fox News. ""It\'s needed more and more every day.""\n\nThe shelters are 8-by-8 foot rooms built with ballistic material that can stop any bullet that\'s been used in a school shooting to date. Dry erase material is on the outside so the rooms blend in with the classroom.\n\nWHO ARE THE NASHVILLE SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS?\n\nThe bulletproof shelter stands in the corner of a teacher\'s classroom. From the outside, it looks like a dry-erase board. (Fox News)\n\nThomas says he started working on the idea after a conversation with his wife after 21 people, including 19 children were killed at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last May. Thomas works in construction and his wife asked him to build something that could save lives.\n\n""Seeing people in Texas and the parents going don\'t let this be for nothing, remember us, with that I can say we heard them loud and clear,"" Thomas said. ""After 25 years of standing by hoping somebody else would do something, we decided it\'s time for us to do something.""\n\nThe shelter can hold up to 60 elementary school aged children, 45 middle schoolers, or 30 high school students. The shelter is collapsible and can lie against the wall, or it can be set up in a corner as a reading or free time room.\n\nWhen it\'s collapsed, it can be pulled out in less than 10 seconds during an emergency.\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCES SCHOOL SECURITY, TRAININGS AFTER WAVE OF COPYCAT SHOOTING THREATS\n\nA teacher demonstrates how she can deploy the shelter if there\'s an emergency. (WBRC Fox 6 News)\n\n""Maybe we don\'t stop them, but we can minimize the effectiveness,"" Thomas said. ""We\'re not hiding under desks anymore, turning out the lights, closing the door or hiding in a corner.""\n\n""Research tells us buying time saves lives during the unimaginable event of a school shooting,"" Cullman City Schools Superintendent Kyle Kallhoff told FOX in a statement. ""These safe rooms would provide time for our School Resource Officers and other trained first responders to react in a worse case scenario.""\n\nKallhoff said he hopes the pilot program in his school district will lead to federal and state funding for every school in America to have these safe rooms. Each shelter costs about $60,000 to install.\n\nIn this classroom, the teacher has the safe room set up as a reading or free time room. (Fox News)\n\n""We need to make sure that all schools have the equal opportunity to get these in their schools, not just the ones that can fund it themselves,"" Thomas said.\n\nGOP SENATOR SAYS BIDEN\'S DEPT. OF EDUCATION IMPOSING \'DANGEROUS DELAYS\' ON SCHOOL SECURITY FUNDS\n\nThomas also emphasizes that he doesn\'t want the money to come out of state or federal education budgets, but believes federal funding can be reallocated. He\'s going to Capitol Hill later this month to work with legislators on lobbying for the funding.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n""We want to install a million in a year,"" Thomas said.

"Denison Announces Completion of Conceptual Mining Study Evaluating ISR for Midwest and Plans to Advance Efforts in 2023 TORONTO, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - Denison Mines Corp. (""Denison"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: DML) (NYSE American: DNN) is pleased to announce the successful completion of an internal conceptual mining study (the ""Concept Study"") examining the potential application of the In-Situ Recovery (""ISR"") mining method at the Company\'s 25.17% owned Midwest project (""Midwest""). The Concept Study was prepared by Denison during 2022 and was formally issued to the Midwest Joint Venture (""MWJV"") in early 2023. Based on the positive results of the Concept Study, the MWJV has now provided Denison with approval to complete additional ISR-related evaluation work for Midwest in 2023. View PDF version.\n\nMidwest is located approximately 25 kilometres, by existing roads, from the 22.5% Denison owned McClean Lake uranium mill, and is a joint venture owned by Denison (25.17%) and Orano Canada Inc. (""Orano Canada"") (74.83%). Orano Canada is part of the Orano Group, which is recognized as a leading international operator in the field of nuclear materials, with activities including uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, and other fuel services.\n\nDavid Cates, Denison\'s President & CEO, commented, ""Since the completion of the Wheeler River Pre-Feasibility Study in 2018, Denison has invested in the development of a highly skilled and motivated Saskatoon-based technical team that has demonstrated industry leadership in the evaluation of the application of the ISR mining method to high-grade uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin.\n\nWe are encouraged by the results of the Midwest Concept Study, and we are pleased to continue the further evaluation of the potential application of the ISR mining method to Midwest, with the support of our partner Orano.""\n\nEvaluation activities planned for Midwest during 2023 include the collection of deposit-specific information and the completion of select preliminary engineering studies to support the further evaluation and de-risking of the key criteria required to further assess the potential application of the ISR mining method, which may result in the preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment to support the development, if warranted, of future field tests.\n\nMidwest is situated in the eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region in northern Saskatchewan. The property is approximately one kilometre from the Points North Landing airstrip and about 25 kilometres west, by existing roads, from the McClean Lake mill, which is jointly owned by Denison (22.5%) and Orano Canada (77.5%). Access to Midwest is by both road and air. Goods are transported to the site by truck over an all-weather road connecting with the provincial highway system. Air transportation is provided through the Points North airstrip (See Figure 1).\n\nInitial exploration work at Midwest began in 1966, and Denison first became an owner of the project in 1987. In 2007, Orano Canada completed an internal study evaluating the feasibility of mining the Midwest Main deposit via open pit mining methods with processing of the resulting ore at the McClean Lake mill. The MWJV subsequently advanced the project through the environmental assessment process as an open pit mine and the final version of the Midwest Project Environmental Impact Statement was approved in September 2012.\n\nThe Midwest Main uranium deposit (""Midwest Main"") is estimated to contain, on a 100% ownership basis, an Indicated mineral resource of 39,900,000 lbs U3O8, based on 453,000 tonnes at an average grade of 4.00% U3O8, and an Inferred mineral resource of 11,500,000 lbs U3O8 based on 793,000 tonnes at an average grade of 0.66% U3O8. Midwest Main is lens to cigar shaped, 600 metres long, 10 to over 100 metres wide, with thicknesses ranging from 5 metres to 10 metres. The deposit consists of a near-massive high-grade mineralized core that straddles the unconformity approximately 210 metres below surface. The high-grade core is surrounded by lower-grade fracture-controlled mineralization primarily in sandstone.\n\nMidwest is also host to the Midwest A uranium deposit (""Midwest A""), which is estimated to contain, on a 100% ownership basis, an Indicated mineral resource of 10,800,000 lbs U3O8, based on 566,000 tonnes at an average grade of 0.87% U3O8, and an Inferred mineral resources totaling 6,700,000 lbs U3O8 based on 53,000 tonnes at an average grade of 5.8% U3O8. Midwest A is approximately 450 metres long, 10 to 60 metres wide, ranges up to 70 metres in thickness and occurs between 150 and 235 metres below surface. Mineralization straddles the unconformity contact with minor amounts hosted within basement structures immediately below the unconformity. Thicker zones of mineralization above the unconformity are concentrated in conglomerate units at the base of the Athabasca sandstone. Similar to Midwest Main, a high-grade core of mineralization is surrounded by a lower-grade fracture-controlled envelope.\n\nThe mineral resource estimate for Midwest (and the technical information herein) is described in the independent technical report, prepared in accordance with NI 43-101, titled ""Technical Report with an Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Midwest Property, Northern Saskatchewan, Canada"", dated March 26, 2018.\n\nThe Concept Study evaluated the potential use of the ISR mining method at Midwest. In an ISR uranium mining operation, a mining solution (lixiviant) is injected into the ore zone through a series of drill holes known as injection wells. The lixiviant leaches the uranium as it travels through the ore zone and is then recovered as a uranium bearing solution (""UBS""), which is pumped back to surface via a series of recovery wells. Once on surface, the UBS is sent to a surface processing plant for the chemical separation of the uranium. Following the uranium removal, the lixiviant is reconditioned and returned to the wellfield for further production. The ISR mining method accounts for a significant portion of uranium mine production globally and is generally considered the lowest-cost uranium mining method in the world – owing to the fact that the method eliminates (i) the surface disturbances and costs associated with physically removing ore and waste from the ground, and (ii) the need for conventional tailings treatment and storage, which are normally associated with underground or open pit mining operations.\n\nThe internal studies undertaken on Midwest are preliminary in nature and there is significant uncertainty with respect to the potential for, and the economic and technical risks associated with, the use of ISR mining for the Midwest deposits. Further technical evaluations may not be advisable or completed if the preliminary results of internal studies are not maintained after further testing and/or analysis.\n\nDenison is a uranium exploration and development company with interests focused in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, Canada The Company has an effective 95% interest in its flagship Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. Denison\'s interests in Saskatchewan also include a 22.5% ownership interest in the McClean Lake joint venture, which includes several uranium deposits and the McClean Lake uranium mill that is contracted to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine under a toll milling agreement, plus a 25.17% interest in the Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits, and a 67.41% interest in the Tthe Heldeth Túé (""THT,"" formerly J Zone) and Huskie deposits on the Waterbury Lake property. The Midwest Main, Midwest A, THT and Huskie deposits are each located within 20 kilometres of the McClean Lake mill.\n\nThrough its 50% ownership of JCU, Denison holds additional interests in various uranium project joint ventures in Canada, including the Millennium project (JCU 30.099%), the Kiggavik project (JCU 33.8118%) and Christie Lake (JCU 34.4508%). Denison\'s exploration portfolio includes further interests in properties covering  300,000 hectares in the Athabasca Basin region.\n\nDenison is also engaged in post-closure mine care and maintenance services through its Closed Mines group, which manages Denison\'s reclaimed mine sites in the Elliot Lake region and provides related services to certain third-party projects.\n\nFollow Denison on Twitter @DenisonMinesCo\n\nThe disclosure of scientific or technical information contained in this release has been reviewed and approved, as applicable, by Mr. Chad Sorba, P.Geo., Denison\'s Director, Technical Services or Mr. Andrew Yackulic, P. Geo., Denison\'s Director, Exploration, who are Qualified Persons in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101.\n\nCertain information contained in this news release constitutes \'forward-looking information\', within the meaning of the applicable United States and Canadian legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Denison.

"Oval Office 'feebleness' and CCP sympathizers allow Xi to drive a wedge between US and Europe: Gordon Chang Gordon Chang said Biden\'s weak approach to China allows Xi to divide the U.S. from its European allies following French President Macron\'s visit to Beijing.\n\n""Feebleness in the Oval Office"" and pro-China sympathizers pushing friendly policies have led to European leaders cozying up to America\'s biggest adversary, China expert Gordon Chang told Fox News.\n\n""One of the main Chinese foreign policy goals these days is to divide Europe from the United States,"" said Chang. ""And it looks like some days they are actually succeeding.""\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to distance himself from U.S. interests after spending three days meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing last week. He said in an interview with the French newspaper Les Echo that Europe should not follow the ""American rhythm"" on Taiwan and ""should not be caught up in a disordering of the world and crises that aren\'t ours.""\n\nWATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE\n\nChang said Macron\'s ""unjustified"" comments undermine the U.S., ""but fortunately, European leaders and others severely criticized Macron for these comments, which certainly weakened Europe\'s security.\n\n""If Macron doesn\'t want to support the U.S. and Taiwan, then the obvious question is, \'Should the U.S. be supporting Europe and Ukraine?\'""\n\nThe U.S. has committed more than $200 billion in aid to Ukraine since Russia\'s invasion in 2022, far exceeding that of other NATO countries.\n\nThe U.S. is also the largest contributor to NATO\'s military spending, while other European allies fail to meet the treaty\'s 2% defense spending obligation.\n\n""Until they\'re willing to pay for their defense, they are dependent on the U.S.,"" Chang said.

"Depressed man, 30, claims he's cured himself by taking daily dips in freezing water A depressed man believes he has cured himself -- by taking daily dips in freezing water.\n\nMitchell Bock, from Caerphilly in Wales, is now starting to slowly wean himself off antidepressants.\n\nAnd he has already stopped taking his anti-anxiety medication.\n\nThe 30-year-old said of the benefits of icy water dips: 'I see it as swapping out a whole day of discomfort for a few minutes. You come out feeling amazing. It really is an instant thing.'\n\nMr Bock has battled severe depression, anxiety and feelings of dread for the past 10 years.\n\nMitchell Bock (pictured cold water swimming), 30, was suffering from severe depression, anxiety and feelings of dread for years, which lead him to attempting suicide last year\n\nMr Bock (pictured taking ice baths) has stopped taking his medication as he believes daily dips in freezing water are working just as well\n\nThe finance worker's ordeals led to him attempting suicide last year.\n\nHe was hospitalised by a crisis team and discharged after 13 hours with one single follow-up call, which he described as a 'tick-box exercise'.\n\nFeeling let down by his follow-up care, Mr Bock felt 'hopeless' and began looking at alternative treatments with his mother Melanie Aldridge, 50.\n\nMr Bock said: 'It was kind of a where do I go from here sort of thing. When I went to hospital, I thought at least I would get help.'\n\nWeeks after his suicide attempt, Mr Bock's mother sent him an ice bath tub -- which are designed to retain cold.\n\nMr Bock started using it straight away and claims he began to feel the effects within a few days.\n\n'When I first did it, I remember waking up without the usual feeling of dread,' he said.\n\n'It was like going to bed with the flu and waking up completely cured.'\n\nHe now tries to have an ice bath or a cold shower every day, and sometimes goes wild swimming in freezing water instead.\n\nThe coldest bath he has done was at zero degrees, surrounded by snow.\n\nMr Bock feels 'that confident' in the ice-water therapy's effects that he has stopped taking his anti-anxiety medication and attending regular therapy sessions.\n\nHe said: 'I've been on meds and going to therapy for years. Whenever I've rung the doctors, it's been a short conversation and they've told me to up my meds.\n\n'I have started weaning myself off one of my medications and stopped taking one altogether. I'm that confident in how I'm feeling.'\n\nMr Bock (pictured taking ice baths), from Caerphilly, began looking into ice-water therapy after being discharged from hospital, as he was disappointed by the care he received and was left feeling 'hopeless'\n\nMr Bock tries to have an ice bath, a cold shower every day, and sometimes goes wild swimming in freezing water instead (pictured)\n\nThe coldest bath the finance worker has done was at zero degrees, surrounded by snow\n\nMr Bock added: 'I don't find it uncomfortable anymore. At first your body panics. You feel tingling and your heart races, but once you control your breathing its fine.'\n\nIce baths are proven to have physical health benefits, hence why sports stars such as Usain Bolt and Andy Murray are known for using them.\n\nBut research also suggests ice-water therapy is good for you mental health too.\n\nBournemouth University researchers said in February that a brain scan was proof of this.\n\nThe MRI image -- taken from a volunteer asked to take a five-minute dip in a 20C (68F) bath -- showed changes in tiny parts of the brain that connect to each other.\n\nThe results, published in the journal Biology, showed increased connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex -- indicated by red patches on the scans.\n\nThese parts of the brain are involved in maintaining attention, helping decision-making and controlling emotions.\n\nAs well as this, experts believe the shock of cold that comes from outdoor swimming can boost levels of dopamine and the release of endorphins -- feel-good hormones -- in the brain.\n\n1. Never swim alone. Always take someone with you so that you can look out for each other.\n\n2. If you're swimming in the sea, choose beaches with lifeguards and pay attention to the flag warning system.\n\n3. Check the water quality -- does it look clean? Is it free of blue-green algae and other obvious warning signs? Waterways near urban areas are particularly likely to contain harmful bacteria.\n\n4. Wear the right kit -- swim shoes to protect feet from rocks, a wetsuit if it's cold, and make yourself visible with a brightly coloured swim hat.\n\n5. Plan your exit point before getting into the water and don't try to stay in too long, especially when it's cold. Know your limits.\n\n6. Use a tow float for buoyancy.\n\n7. Pack warm clothes for afterwards and stay moving to warm up.\n\n8. Keep an eye out for strong currents and sudden changes in depth.\n\n9. Never jump in without acclimatising to the water temperature and check the landing area.\n\n10. Swim where others swim -- but avoid areas crowded with boats or used for watersports. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11963833/Depressed-man-30-claims-hes-cured-taking-daily-dips-freezing-water.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"I paid £150 for a tablet in Tenerife and it ended up costing me £2,128 Sunseeker Bridget Manning was browsing a rail of bright summer clothes in a souvenir shop in Tenerife three weeks ago when the shop assistant asked her whether she was interested in their cheap deals on electronics.\n\nThe 84-year-old widow was told that for just £150 she could get her hands on a 'top-of-the-range' tablet computer.\n\nEven better, she needed to put down only a £26 deposit to take the tablet away with her to try it out.\n\nA new electronics scam that has taken off in Tenerife sees shopkeepers 'accidentally' overcharge a credit or debit card without the knowledge of the buyer\n\nContact laurence.dollimore@mailonline.co.uk\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth to change the tablet's language from Spanish to English, she returned to the shop on Los Cristianos promenade on the day she was due to fly back to England, and paid in full for the gadget.\n\nBut upon arriving home in Warwickshire, Bridget discovered her two bank accounts had been emptied of £2,128 -- money she'd saved up by taking on cleaning and ironing jobs in retirement.\n\n'It seemed like a good deal and they were very charming -- they even offered me and my friends soft drinks and had us sit down,' she recalls of the scammers.\n\n'I need this money to pay my bills. I am so distraught -- I've been crying for many days and cannot sleep at night.'\n\nBridget, a retired legal assistant from Stratford-upon-Avon, had fallen for a heartless scam that has taken off in Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands.\n\nMoney Mail has heard from a number of victims, who say the ruse typically starts with a shop offering a product at a very low price and then pressuring the customer into upgrading to another item at a considerably higher price.\n\nThe shopkeepers then 'accidentally' overcharge a credit or debit card without the knowledge of the buyer.\n\nWhen Bridget bought her tablet, she was told her card -- which she uses for holidays -- did not work.\n\nAfter three attempts, she tried a second debit card -- for her main bank account with Santander -- and entered her PIN. This was 'accepted' and she was given a guarantee for the tablet.\n\nBut she now recalls how the conman dangled his hand in front of the payment terminal screen to obscure the sums entered.\n\nBridget Manning was told that for just £150 she could get her hands on a 'top-of-the-range' tablet computer\n\nBridget says she couldn't see the total she was being charged and did not receive a receipt either.\n\nAs part of the bluff, the shop assistant asked to take photographs of her passport, with the excuse that it would help her to declare the tablet when she went through customs.\n\nAs Bridget found, one red flag for this scam is the salesman suggesting you return to the shop on the last day of your holiday to make the full payment.\n\nThe idea is that you'll be many hundreds of miles away before you realise you've been hoodwinked.\n\nWhen Bridget notified Santander that she had fallen victim to a scam, she was denied any compensation on the grounds that she had willingly entered her PIN to make the payment.\n\nMoney Mail has asked the bank to investigate again.\n\nAfter we got involved, Santander agreed to reimburse Bridget the full £2,128 she had lost.\n\nA spokesman for the bank says: 'We would encourage all customers always to check carefully that they are paying the correct amount before making any payment, and if they are in any doubt not to make it.'\n\nIt couldn't explain how both accounts were fully drained.\n\nIt is vital to see the sum you are paying on the card terminal before entering your PIN, they added.\n\nLynn Mackenzie also fell victim when she was on holiday in Tenerife in November last year. She was told she had to sign up for broadband in order to set up the tablet in English, but that the subscription could be cancelled as soon as she got home.\n\nUpon realising it was a scam, she urgently asked her bank to block the payment, but it was too late -- £1,750 had already been transferred.\n\nAnother reader, Susie Adlington, was horrified to find that her father had been conned.\n\nHe was on a surprise holiday to Tenerife that she and her uncle had taken him on to celebrate his 87th birthday.\n\n'We were on a mobility scooter when a guy came out of a shop on the seafront promenade and started speaking to us about buying a tablet and a phone SIM card,' Susie says.\n\nHer father lost £1,500 to the scammers, while her uncle handed over £280 in cash. 'A surprise birthday in the sun turned into a nightmare. These terrible people are preying on elderly folk.'\n\nj.beard@dailymail.co.uk https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/beatthescammers/article-11960571/I-paid-150-tablet-Tenerife-ended-costing-2128.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

"Families still caught up in a backlog of complaints at Scottish Widows By Jessica Beard For The Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 16:51 EDT, 11 April 2023   Updated: 06:29 EDT, 12 April 2023\n\nHundreds of families are still caught in a backlog of complaints following a customer service meltdown at Scottish Widows, despite the firm's promises to clear the logjam by the end of March.\n\nMany bereaved families have waited months to get hold of money they are entitled to from the insurance and pension firm after a loved one has died. In the worst cases, it has taken almost a year for the cash to be paid out.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Money Mail in January, Scottish Widows' chief operating officer Donald MacKechnie told us that up to 6,000 families were still waiting for their complaints to be resolved.\n\nBacklog: Many bereaved families have waited months to get hold of money from Scottish Widows despite the firm's promises to clear the logjam by the end of March\n\nHe promised that all of those cases would be cleared by March 31, which came as a relief to frustrated customers.\n\nWithin the first month, the backlog had fallen to 4,700. But as of March 31, more than 600 are still awaiting an answer.\n\nA spokesman for Scottish Widows says: 'The remainder are generally more complex cases and will be resolved in the weeks ahead.\n\n'We're very sorry that some of our customers have not received the level of service they should have over recent months.'\n\nThe company has now increased the number of staff answering calls and dealing with customer requests. Complaints should be resolved within four weeks of being lodged, the spokesman adds.\n\nj.beard@dailymail.co.uk\n\nSome links in this article may be affiliate links.

"Biden administration declares fentanyl laced with xylazine 'an emerging threat' in the US The White House has declared that the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl combined with xylazine – an animal tranquilizer that\'s increasingly being used in illicit drugs – is an ""emerging threat"" facing the United States due to its role in the ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nAdministration officials call the threat FAAX, for fentanyl-adulterated or -associated xylazine.\n\nThe move, announced Wednesday, marks the first time in history that any administration has declared a substance to be an emerging threat to the country, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The SUPPORT Act of 2018 established that the office has authority to declare such ""emerging threats,"" and no administration has used it until now.\n\n""This drug, which is an animal sedative, is being mixed with fentanyl and is being found in almost all 50 states now,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""It\'s become an important part for us to make sure that we\'re declaring it an emerging threat.""\n\nNow that the administration has declared fentanyl combined with xylazine an emerging threat, it has 90 days to coordinate a national response. ""We are working quickly to develop and implement a whole of government nationwide plan, with real deliverable action, that will save lives and will be published within 90 days of this designation,"" Gupta said.\n\nXylazine, also known as tranq or tranq dope, has been linked to an increasing number of overdose deaths in the United States due to its rising illicit use. Between 2020 and 2021, overdose deaths involving xylazine increased more than 1,000% in the South, 750% in the West and about 500% in the Midwest, according to an intelligence report released last year by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nAnd in some cases, people might not even know that xylazine was in the drug they used.\n\nJust last month, authorities at the DEA issued a public safety alert about the ""widespread threat"" of fentanyl mixed with xylazine, reporting that in 2022 approximately 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine.\n\nFentanyl, which has been driving the opioid crisis, is a fast-acting opioid, and people who use it illicitly say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high the drug provides.\n\nXylazine is not an opioid. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as a tranquilizer in veterinary medicine, typically in horses, but it is not approved for use in humans. And xylazine can do major damage to the human body, including leaving drug users with severe skin ulcers, soft-tissue wounds and necrosis – sometimes described as rotting skin – that can lead to amputation.\n\n""Xylazine is one of the contaminants in fentanyl, but there could be others,"" Gupta said. ""So, I think with the declaration of an emerging threat, we\'re sending a clear message to producers and traffickers of illicit xylazine and illicit fentanyl that we\'re going to respond quicker, we\'re going to match the challenge of evolution of these drugs supply, and that we\'re going to protect lives first and foremost.""\n\n\'There is a shift that is occurring\'\n\nNow that xylazine has been declared an emerging threat, some of President Biden\'s $46 billion drug budget request to Congress can be used to respond.\n\nThis year, the Biden administration announced that the President has called on Congress to invest $46.1 billion for agencies overseen by the Office of National Drug Control Policy to tackle the nation\'s illicit drug crisis.\n\nIf the budget request is not approved, there could be the option to reallocate money within the Office of National Drug Control Policy, but ""we don\'t want to be in a position where moneys that are being utilized for some other important aspect of saving lives has to be moved away for this purpose,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""That is the reason we are asking Congress to act.""\n\nSuch funds could be used to test drugs on the street for xylazine, collect data on FAAX, invest in care for people exposed to FAAX and develop potential treatments for a xylazine-related overdose.\n\nThe medication naloxone, also known as Narcan, is an antidote for an opioid overdose, but people who have overdosed on a combination of opioids and xylazine may not immediately wake up after taking naloxone, as it may not reverse the effects of xylazine in the same way it does opioids.\n\n""We need to recognize, first of all, that there is a shift that is occurring from organic compounds and substances like heroin and cocaine to more synthetics,"" Gupta said of the state of the nation\'s illicit drug crisis.\n\n""Both the types of drugs have changed – from predominantly organic to predominantly synthetics – but the way drugs are bought and sold have also changed,"" he said. ""Now, all you need is a phone in the palm of your hand and a social media app to order and buy some of the most dangerous substances on planet Earth.""\n\nRise of synthetic drugs\n\nXylazine is just one of the many adulterants – or substances that are typically added to others – found in the nation\'s illicit drug supply.\n\n""All of a sudden, you can synthesize hundreds of compounds and kind of mix them together and see what does the best in the market,"" Joseph Friedman, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN in March. ""People are synthesizing new benzodiazepines, new stimulants, new cannabinoids constantly and adding them into the drug supply. So people have no idea what they\'re buying and what they\'re consuming.""\n\nSome of these adulterants may be as simple as sugar or artificial sweeteners added for taste or additives or fillers that bulk up the drug. Sometimes, they may be contaminants left over from the manufacturing process.\n\nBut all of these things can carry real-life health harms, says Naburan Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and senior scientist at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nLike an opioid, xylazine can depress the respiratory system, so the risk of overdose multiplies when it\'s combined with heroin or fentanyl.\n\nAlso, ""in the veterinary literature, we know that it causes a really bad severe form of anemia. And so when people are injecting heroin that\'s contaminated with xylazine, they can end up with a near-fatal form of blood iron deficiency,"" Dasgupta said in March. ""We had one person here who ended up going to the hospital needing multiple blood transfusions. And it was all because of the xylazine.""\n\nMove to make xylazine a controlled substance\n\nUS lawmakers are moving to classify xylazine as a controlled substance.\n\nIn March, bipartisan legislation – the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act – was introduced in the House and Senate. It describes illicit xylazine as an ""urgent threat to public health and safety"" and calls for it to be a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act, a category on the five-level system for substances with moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. Xylazine would be one level below opioids like fentanyl.\n\n""Our bipartisan bill would take important steps to combat the abuse of xylazine by giving law enforcement more authority to crack down on the illicit distribution of this drug, including by putting stiffer penalties on criminals who are spreading this drug to our communities,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said in a statement in March.\n\nThe bill would also require manufacturers to send reports on production and distribution to the DEA so the agency can ensure that the product is not being diverted to the black market.\n\nGet CNN Health\'s weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n""This bill recognizes the dangers posed by the increasing abuse of animal tranquilizers by drug traffickers, and provides new tools to combat this deadly trend,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in the statement.\n\n""It also ensures that folks like veterinarians, ranchers and cattlemen can continue to access these drugs for bona fide animal treatment.""\n\nCNN\'s Janelle Chavez and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/health/fentanyl-xylazine-emerging-threat-us/index.html"

"'Turn over every rock': US vows to find source of intel leaks The United States will investigate the leak of classified documents and ""turn over every rock"" until the source is found, its military chief says.\n\nDocuments labelled ""Secret"" and ""Top Secret"" first appeared on social media sites in March and purportedly reveal details of the military capabilities of some American allies and adversaries.\n\n""We will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it,"" US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday.\n\nAustin, the first senior US official to comment on the leak, said the Pentagon was not sure if other documents were circulated.\n\n""These are things that we will find out as we continue to investigate,"" Austin said.\n\nUS Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns called the leaks ""deeply unfortunate"" but did not give details on what he said were ""quite intense"" investigations by the Pentagon and the Justice Department.\n\n""We need to learn lessons from that, as well, about how we can tighten procedures,"" Burns said.\n\nInvestigators are working to determine what person or group might have had the ability and motivation to release the intelligence reports.\n\nThe leaks could be the most damaging release of US government information since the 2010 publication of thousands of documents on WikiLeaks.\n\nSome of the most sensitive information is purportedly related to Ukraine\'s military capabilities and shortcomings, and one document mentions the small number of Western special forces soldiers in the country.\n\nThe Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the disclosure.\n\nSome national security experts and US officials say they suspect the leaker could be American, given the breadth of topics covered by the documents.

"Trump asks to delay sexual assault trial following historic indictment Lawyers for former President Donald Trump asked a judge to delay the start of a sexual assault and defamation trial for one month to allow a ""cooling off"" period following the historic indictment charging Trump with falsifying business records.\n\nJoe Tacopina, an attorney for Trump, asked the judge overseeing the battery and defamation lawsuit brought by former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll to delay the trial until the end of May. The trial is scheduled to start on April 25.\n\nTacopina said the pool of potential jurors will have the criminal charges ""top of mind"" when they are called due to intense media coverage and that could taint the jury pool. Trump was charged with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about a past affair days before the 2016 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\n""To be sure, President Trump is a persistent subject of media coverage. But the present situation is unique because, as stated above, the recent coverage pertains to alleged sexual misconduct, the same issue at the heart of this litigation,"" Tacopina said in his letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan.\n\nTrump has denied the affair with Daniels. He has also denied sexually assaulting Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. She first sued Trump for defamation in 2019 after he denied the rape, said ""she\'s not my type"" and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-lawyers-trial/index.html"
"'Bond Kings' Bill Gross and Jeffrey Gundlach hint a credit crunch is looming as surging rates and banking jitters hit lending Bill Gross and Jeffrey Gundlach appear to be bracing for a credit crunch as surging interest rates and banking fears threaten to strangle lending.\n\nIn response to inflation hitting 40-year highs, the Federal Reserve has raised rates from nearly zero to upwards of 4.75% since last March. Gross, Pimco\'s cofounder and the former boss of its flagship Total Return fund, warned in a Tuesday tweet that hiking at that speed and scale inevitably hits banks\' finances and increases lending risks.\n\n""Fed\'s Williams dismisses link between rate hikes and bank stress !!!!"" Gross wrote, after New York Fed President John Williams said he didn\'t believe rising rates were responsible for the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March.\n\n""Rather unbelievable,"" Gross continued. ""450 basis points and more rate hikes in 12 months time are bound to affect balance sheets that use proper accounting -- duration and credit as well.""\n\nGross -- who shares the ""Bond King"" moniker with Gundlach -- likely meant that higher rates have eroded the value of banks\' bonds and other assets, and exposed lenders to greater risk of loan defaults.\n\nMeanwhile, Gundlach noted in a Tuesday tweet that small businesses are finding it as costly and difficult to access credit today as they did at the height of the financial crisis.\n\n""The NFIB Small Business Credit Conditions Index is plummeting (not surprisingly given recent bank failures) and it is now in the same place it was in late 2007/early 2008,"" the DoubleLine Capital CEO said.\n\nThe two billionaire investors seem worried that banks -- spooked by the tidal wave of withdrawals that hit SVB and the blow to their bond portfolios over the past year -- may tighten their lending standards and charge more interest in anticipation of further turmoil.\n\nThat could translate into a wider credit crunch that squeezes consumers, starves businesses of cash, and tanks the US economy.\n\nGross and Gundlach recently raised the alarm on an imminent downturn. Gross urged investors to be careful as he expects a recession shortly, while Gundlach flagged ""red alert recession signals"" in the bond market. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gross-gundlach-bond-kings-credit-crunch-interest-rates-banking-crisis-2023-4"

In the past year, values have rocketed £37,291.\n\nHenry Sherwood, managing director of The Buying Agents, which advises home buyers, says: 'The area has performed incredibly well in the last decade for residential buyers and investors alike.\n\n'A decade ago, it was popular with first and second-rung homebuyers as you could snap up a lovely Victorian terrace for under half a million.'\n\nAneisha Beveridge, Hamptons' head of research, says: 'Waltham Forest, which borders Stratford, has benefited hugely from the 2012 Olympic-led redevelopment.'\n\nHastings, in East Sussex, takes the silver medal, with house values in the seaside town rising £157,940 -- or 115 per cent -- from just £137,090 a decade ago, to £295,030.\n\nJosh Avis, of Phillip Mann estate agents in Seaford, East Sussex, near Hastings, says: 'We get a lot of movers from London, particularly south and east London, who want a change of pace of life and to be by the sea.'\n\nA year ago, the average property in Hastings cost £21,061 less than it does today.\n\nTop of the house price tree for growth in the past decade is Waltham Forest, on the London/Essex border where prices have risen 119%\n\nThanet, in Kent, which includes Broadstairs, Margate and Ramsgate, takes bronze, with values rising by £170,200, from £147,950 to £318,150, since 2013. In the past year, they are up £26,670.\n\nMr Sherwood says working from home is a factor here, and adds: 'Thanet was always popular with the creative and arty set and it has really boomed with the advent of technology.'\n\nThe London borough of Barking and Dagenham takes fourth place, while Bristol is fifth. Values in this major city are up by £186,100, from £177,130 a decade ago to £363,230 today, with an influx of creatives and young buyers.\n\nOne of the clearest trends from the Hamptons data is just how much property prices have boomed in pockets of Essex and Kent clustered around the River Thames, to the east of London.\n\nThis trend is likely to be driven by the proximity to London, with good train connections -- but also because people are looking for value.\n\nMr Sherwood says: 'For many buyers, it was worth going an extra stop or two down the line for an extra bedroom or 10-15 per cent more interior space.'\n\nNearly half of the 20 areas with the biggest percentage growth in property prices are in these areas: Rochford, Thurrock, Basildon, Southend-on-Sea and Castle Point in Essex; Thanet, Medway and Swale in Kent, and the London borough of Barking and Dagenham.\n\nOverall, to have bought the average property in one of these nine areas would have cost a buyer £174,640 in 2013, our analysis shows. Now, that figure stands at £356,002 -- more than double. It means properties have added £18,136 of value, on average, each year of the past decade.\n\n  How much could you afford for a new home? Check what you could borrow with out best mortgage rates calculator\n\nFour of the top 20 areas for property price growth are in or around Manchester -- Tameside, Trafford, Salford and the city centre.\n\nTo buy in one of these areas a decade ago would have typically cost £130,495. Today, that figure stands at £261,610 -- a doubling in a decade. Values are up £13,111 every year since 2013.\n\nMr Sherwood says: 'Much of this growth has come from investors as the entry price in Manchester was half of that of the South.'\n\nFour of the top 20 areas for property price growth are in and around Manchester - Tameside, Trafford, Salford and the city centre\n\nIn 2013, there were 28 areas of Britain where you could buy a typical home for under £100,000. There are now none.\n\nA decade ago, £100,000 would have bought you a home in seven areas of both Scotland and Northern Ireland and six in the North West.\n\nIn Wales, four areas had average prices under this level, as did two areas in the East Midlands and one area each in Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands.\n\nThe average home in Nottingham cost £99,010 in 2013 -- now, it's £193,860. That rapid growth puts it just outside the top 20 locations for biggest percentage price rise.\n\nBurnley in Lancashire holds the title of the cheapest place to buy. It costs £117,320 on average, compared to £71,040 ten years ago.\n\nAt the bottom of the pile for house price growth over the past decade is Aberdeen. It's the only area on the entire list to have seen a decrease in values, a drop of 15 per cent in the past decade. Aberdeenshire as a whole saw growth of 19 per cent.\n\nHamptons points out the Scottish city is 'a unique market, predominantly impacted by the ups and downs in the oil industry'.\n\nCompleting the bottom five for percentage growth are some of the most exclusive parts of London: Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Westminster.\n\nPrices in these boroughs are up 21 per cent, 23 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.\n\nBut, although they were so high in these areas already, they have still seen values rise £218,640, £140,400 and £185,800 respectively.\n\nAccording to the ONS data, Kensington remains the only area in the country where a typical home costs seven figures -- rising from £1,061,390 10 years ago, to £1,280,030 today.\n\nMr Sherwood says: 'Many owners simply do not need to sell in hard times so they just ride out price fluctuations.'\n\nAneisha Beveridge believes we are unlikely to see as much house price growth in the next ten years as we've seen in the past decade.\n\nShe says: 'Affordability is stretched, and mortgage rates will likely remain higher during the next decade, limiting what buyers are able and willing to spend on their homes.\n\n'We think the current property cycle will come to a close in the next few years and from 2025, we expect history to repeat itself.'\n\nZoom in to see where your region ranks in the house price changes charts. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-11960995/The-50-house-price-hot-spots-doubling-10-years.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"Top economist David Rosenberg says inflation will come down hard no matter what the Fed does - so more hikes would be a mistake Inflation is going to shoot lower in the US no matter what the Federal Reserve decides to do next on monetary policy, according to top economist David Rosenberg.\n\nThat means the US central bank would be wrong to make any more interest rate hikes, the Rosenberg Research founder said in a CNBC interview Tuesday.\n\n""I think it\'s a mistake because inflation is going to come down quite hard in the next 12 months, irrespective of what the Fed does in early May. But they\'re obviously not going to take any chances,"" he said.\n\nThe Fed has raised benchmark interest rates to upwards of 4.75% from almost zero 12 months ago, the steepest jump in US borrowing costs since the 1980s. It has moved aggressively to try to quash surging inflation, which hit a 40-year high of 9.1% last summer and remained stubbornly high at 6% year-over-year in February.\n\nHigher rates encourage saving over spending, which can tame the pace increases. But they can also dampen demand, pull down asset prices, and elevate the risk of a recession.\n\nAccording to Rosenberg, the Fed already made a misstep when it raised interest rates at the same time the yield curve was deeply inverted last fall. That\'s when Treasury yields saw their biggest inversion since 1981, traditionally seen as an indicator of a looming recession.\n\nThe economist further noted that once deflation in rental prices starts to show up in official inflation readings, the rate is likely to fall more than the market expects. Shelter makes up 30% of the consumer price index.\n\nInvestors are watching for the March reading of CPI, due Wednesday, for a steer on whether the inflation rate could prompt the Fed to bring in another rate hike at its May meeting. Wall Street expectations are for a print of 5.2%, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nJerome Powell, the chair of the US central bank, has said interest rates will likely need to stay elevated until the labor market cools. To that effect, two-thirds of traders anticipate the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points at its next meeting, per CME Group\'s Fedwatch tool.\n\nRosenberg has repeatedly dismissed inflation as a threat, given price pressures have cooled from their mid-2022 highs. Meanwhile, he\'s shown pessimism about the US economy, warning that a recession has already hit corporate profits. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/inflation-will-come-down-hard-fed-rate-hikes-david-rosenberg-2023-4"
"More on ""Disclosing 'Non-Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements': What Does That Even Mean?"" When it comes to the new disclosure requirements about insider trading, one provision that we keep reading again & again is Item 408(c). I blogged last month about confusion around the type of ""non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement"" that is outlined in Item 408(c), which triggers the quarterly Item 408(a) disclosure.\n\nThe discussion beginning on page 78 of the adopting release says that basically, a non-Rule 10b5-1 plan is a plan that satisfies the old rules for a 10b5-1 plan, but not the new rules. For example, it may not have a cooling-off period. But still, this is an area where folks are continuing to hope for Staff clarification. Here are a few of the head-scratchers that people are grappling with:\n\n– Purchases of issuer stock pursuant to payroll deduction elections (made when there\'s not MNPI) under an employee stock purchase plan.\n\n– Purchases of issuer stock pursuant to elections (made when there\'s not MNPI) under a 401(k) plan.\n\n– Default net share issuance provisions (in award agreements or equity plans) for vested restricted stock units (not sell-to-cover).\n\nDo these and similar arrangements trigger Item 408(a) disclosure? With the new quarterly disclosure requirement quickly approaching, these are questions we\'ll have to figure out very soon!\n\nPosted by Liz Dunshee\n\nPermalink: https://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/2023/04/more-on-disclosing-non-rule-10b5-1-trading-arrangements-what-does-that-even-mean.html https://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/blog/2023/04/more-on-disclosing-non-rule-10b5-1-trading-arrangements-what-does-that-even-mean.html"
"QatarEnergy transferring 5% of its stake in NFE to China's Sinopec Qatar\'s state-owned oil and gas company QatarEnergy has signed a definitive partnership agreement with China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) for the North Field East (NFE) expansion project.\n\nWith this deal, Sinopec becomes the first Aisan shareholder in one of the NFE joint venture companies that own the NFE project.\n\nPursuant to the agreement, QatarEnergy will transfer to Sinopec a 5% interest in the equivalent of one NFE train with a capacity of 8 million tons per annum (mtpa). This agreement will not affect the participating interests of any of the other shareholders, the company noted.\n\nSpeaking at the signing ceremony, Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the Minister of State for Energy Affairs, the President and CEO of QatarEnergy, said: ""The People\'s Republic of China is a major driver of the global energy markets as well as being one of the most important gas markets in the world and is a key market for Qatari energy products. Today\'s event underscores QatarEnergy\'s commitment to deepening its relationships with key LNG consumers, while prioritizing long-term strategic partnerships and alignment with world class partners from China, represented by Sinopec here today.""\n\nMa Yongsheng, the Chairman of Sinopec, added that this agreement is another milestone after the signing of the long-term LNG sale and purchase agreement from the NFE project in November 2022, marking the integrated cooperation achieved by both companies on the NFE project.\n\nQatarEnergy underlined that this agreement is also the first of its kind after last year\'s series of partnership announcements in the $28.75 billion NFE project, which will raise Qatar\'s LNG export capacity from the current 77 mtpa to 110 mtpa. https://www.offshore-energy.biz/qatarenergy-transferring-5-of-its-stake-in-nfe-to-chinas-sinopec/"
"OBF: Terrorism at Boston Marathon failed to break city&#39;s spirit Ten years after he bombed the Boston Marathon with his brother, the lone surviving murderer and one-time pride of Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School continues to decay in federal prison.\n\nHis death penalty sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2022. But the editorial board of John Henry\'s broadsheet can take comfort in the fact that a ban on federal executions remains in place.\n\nWe mention Rolling Stone\'s favorite cover boy (never by name) here because the 127th running of the Boston Marathon on Monday is another reminder of just how badly he and his brother failed.\n\nA decade later and the terrorists still lost.\n\nWe are big on names here when it comes to the innocent lives lost on Marathon Monday 2013: Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell and Lingzi Lu. Nor can we forget Sean Collier, murdered by the two bombers two nights later. And unlike the producers of ""Patriots Day,"" we will always include Boston Police Officer Dennis Simmonds in any tribute. He died in April 2014 from head injuries incurred during the manhunt shootout in Watertown.\n\nTheir loss should forever be part of both state lore and whatever passes for history these days in schools across the Commonwealth.\n\nTo seek balance, we offer this amazing fact: Every one of the 281 injured by the blast who made it to a hospital survived.\n\nSome lost limbs. Or their permanent peace of mind. Yet, two weeks later, nearly 90% of those hospitalized after the bombing had been discharged.\n\nFormer MBTA Officer Dic Donohue, a friend of Collier, was shot in the Watertown crossfire and nearly bled to death. His heart stopped for 45 minutes. But his stubbornness won out and he\'s still with us, too.\n\nThe lives of those who survived may have been shattered by the blast. But they, too, eventually found their ""new normal.""\n\nThere were marriages, divorces, remarriages, births, and all the other trappings that come with routine life.\n\nThe details of that day both real and imagined, were shared across the pages of newspapers and websites around the world. The bombing and subsequent manhunt and lockdown was all you saw on TV for days. It was one of the first major historic news events that spread via social media.\n\nThe 2013 Boston Marathon bombing spawned two major Hollywood films, multiple documentaries and docudramas, and seemingly more books than Whitey Bulger and the 1967 Red Sox combined.\n\nIt continues to amaze why anyone felt it was necessary to embellish or add fictional twists to what happened. Whether you were at the finish line, writing a movie script, or at home napping on your couch.\n\nWe\'ve become close to the survivors, too. So many of them were like so many of us. The Marathon was bombed at 2:49 p.m., long after the professional runners were finished. The people crossing the finish line at the 4:09:43 mark pushed themselves for months or years to get in shape for the race and chase a certain time. Often using it as a fundraising tool.\n\nThese were regular Janes and Joes being cheered on by so many other Janes and Joes as they pushed themselves up Boylston Street. The only wagers were made on whether your cousin from Reading would finish in under five hours.\n\nAnyone who finishes the Boston Marathon has earned their Participation Trophy.\n\nWhile the bombers represented humanity at its worst, the bombing\'s aftermath brought out humanity at its best.\n\nImmediately, police, first responders, National Guard personnel, and civilians rushed to aid the wounded, without thought or concern that there could be multiple bombs – or worse – waiting to counterattack. Some medical personnel kept running to local hospitals. Doctors, nurses, therapists, physician assistants, and anyone else in scrubs didn\'t have time for Tik-Tok videos (there was no Tik-Tok, but you get what we mean). The focus fell on saving lives, limbs and healing souls.\n\nThey batted 1.000 when it came to saving lives.\n\nSports also batted 1.000 in 2013. The Red Sox, Bruins, Celtics and Patriots served as civic glue. While this recollection may not appeal to cynics, it cannot be denied that TD Garden and Fenway Park presented the first two major opportunities for the public to, well, go public after the worst had passed.\n\nThe marathon bombing happened on Monday, April 15.\n\nFive days later, all 17,565 gathered at TD Garden for the Bruins-Penguins game paid tribute. The video still delivers chills 10 years later. The crowd finished the national anthem for Rene Rancourt after he got through 13 words.\n\nThe Red Sox took the field a few moments later, flanked by multiple first responders and other dignitaries. David Ortiz dropped ""The F-Bomb Heard Round The World"" and the two were forever fused by history.\n\nIn addition to offering a literal public square to prove that life had resumed, the city\'s athletes and teams offered their time and treasure to support families of the fallen and those who made it out alive, if not in one piece.\n\nThe ""Boston Strong"" narrative fueled it all.\n\nThe Bruins nearly won the Stanley Cup. And after the Red Sox won the World Series, their Rolling Rally came to a stop at the finish line. There Jarod Saltalamacchia and Jonny Gomes offered the World Series trophy that famed ""617"" jersey as tribute.\n\nThe masses couldn\'t get enough ""Boston Strong"" swag. Police were the good guys. Doctors stuck to medicine. People wanted the Red Sox and Bruins to win. Even those on the radio.\n\nA long time ago in a place far, far, away.\n\nBut one that can never be remembered enough.\n\n(Bill Speros (@BillSperos & @RealOBF) wrote multiple stories about the bombing and its aftermath for boston.com and the Herald.

"'None of us deserved it': Americans who survived kidnapping in Mexico share details of their captivity  More than a month after four Americans were attacked and kidnapped by a drug cartel in Mexico, the two survivors say they\'re still recovering from the trauma of the terrifying ordeal and the killings of their friends.\n\n""They didn\'t deserve that. None of us deserved it. But we\'re alive – we have a lot of recovering to do,"" LaTavia Washington McGee told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview Tuesday.\n\nWashington McGee, Eric Williams, Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were kidnapped on March 3 as they were driving to a medical appointment in Matamoros, Mexico. Woodard and Brown were both killed.\n\nThe attack came in broad daylight, with armed men ambushing the four friends not long after they crossed the US-Mexico border. Investigators believe the Americans were likely mistaken for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official familiar with the investigation previously told CNN.\n\nThe group was driving when they heard a car horn behind them. Brown looked back to see a gun and warned the others not to stop the car, Washington McGee recalled.\n\nThen, the shooting started.\n\n""Zindell and Shaeed, they jumped up to run and they were gunned down,"" Williams said.\n\nAs someone started to beat on the car window with a gun, Williams jumped out of the driver\'s side. ""That\'s when I was shot on both legs,"" Williams said.\n\nWashington McGee was forced into the bed of a pickup truck at gunpoint and the others were carried onto it – a moment captured on video and shared by authorities after the kidnapping.\n\nAn innocent Mexican bystander was killed during the encounter after being hit by a stray bullet almost a block and a half from where the Americans were taken, officials said.\n\n\'He said he loved us and he was gone\'\n\nWilliams and Washington McGee told CNN Brown and Woodward were both still alive when their limp bodies were dragged onto the truck bed.\n\nThe four were then driven to another spot, where they were interrogated.\n\n""That\'s where Shaeed said, \'I love y\'all, and I\'m gone.\' And he died right there,"" Williams said.\n\nAs Woodard lay dying in the back of the pickup truck, ""I told him I was sorry,"" Washington McGee recalled.\n\n""He said he loved us and he was gone. It was the last thing he said,"" Williams said, through tears.\n\n\'Diablo masks\' and guns\n\nWashington McGee and Williams said they were taken to several different locations over the days they spent in captivity, getting blindfolded as they were moved between locations.\n\nAt one point, the group was taken to a house. Outside, they saw armed people in red, plastic ""Diablo"" masks who were ""pointing the guns to our head, telling us not to look up,"" Williams said.\n\nThey were also taken to a clinic, where Williams described his leg being placed on a piece of wood and stitched up.\n\n""No pain medicine or nothing. They just stitched it up,"" Williams said, adding that no one checked to see if a bullet was still inside.\n\nWashington McGee said she was put in a room with Brown, who was badly wounded and dying.\n\n""He was fighting for his life and they didn\'t do nothing,"" she said. ""I talked to him the whole time … I just told him sorry because I asked him to come with me.""\n\n""He was like, \'It\'s okay. I\'m your brother. I\'m supposed to be there for you. I love you,\'"" Washington McGee recalled.\n\nThe kidnappers told them they would take Brown to a hospital, Washington McGee said, but ""they came back maybe an hour later and he was dead.""\n\nAt one point, someone showed Washington McGee the video of their kidnapping. She saw herself being forced into the back of the truck.\n\n""I just started crying. I\'m like, I\'m never going home"" she said.\n\nThen, there was hope.\n\nWashington McGee and Williams were woken up in a dark room to see a man standing over them with a light.\n\n""He was like, \'There\'s nothing that we can do to bring your two brothers back. But we\'re sorry. Somebody made the wrong call. They was high and drunk,\'"" Washington McGee recalled the man saying.\n\n\'They were always a step ahead\'\n\nAt one point, Washington McGee and Williams were blindfolded and taken to a truck. Williams said his friends\' bodies were then placed on top of him to keep him hidden.\n\nThe Americans were driven around all night as they heard the sound of guns being cocked, Washington McGee said.\n\n""They had police scanners and all types of stuff in their trucks. They knew what was going on. They were always a step ahead. So I was like, they\'re never gonna find us like this,"" McGee recalled.\n\nBut eventually, they were dropped off at a wooden shack, where Washington McGee and Williams were rescued on March 7. The survivors and the bodies of their friends were brought back to the US.\n\nWashington McGee said she tried to escape twice during the ordeal, ""for my brothers to have the proper burial and for us to go back home to our family and kids.""\n\nAn apology letter was later issued by the Gulf Cartel, which is believed to be responsible for the kidnappings, and the group handed over five of its members to local authorities, according to images circulating online and a version of the letter obtained by CNN from an official familiar with the ongoing investigation. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the photos and has asked Mexican and US authorities for comment.\n\nThough investigators believe the letter to be authentic, Mexican and US law enforcement officials participating in the investigation strongly doubt the sincerity of the group\'s apology, the official who shared the letter with CNN said.\n\nAt least six people have been arrested in Mexico so far, according to Mexican officials.\n\nCNN\'s Josh Campbell, Karol Suarez, Rosa Flores, Caroll Alvarado and Paul P.

"Tucker Carlson raged against Trump in private. But in interview with the former president he took a very different tone Tucker Carlson plays a straight-shooter on television.\n\nFrom his prime time perch on Fox News, Carlson portrays himself to his loyal audience of millions as a truth-teller, someone who tells it like it is and calls out BS from whoever peddles it.\n\nBut it is all an act, as evidenced by his weak excuse for an interview with former President Donald Trump that aired on Tuesday night, Trump\'s first since being indicted on dozens of felony counts of business fraud.\n\nCarlson sat silent as Trump rambled and ranted his way through the sit-down, making a number of eyebrow-raising comments on a host of topics that were never challenged by the right-wing talk host. Carlson made no effort to press the disgraced president on any of the issues that an actual news anchor would.\n\nInstead, Carlson sang Trump\'s praises.\n\n""For a man caricatured as an extremist, we think you\'ll find what he has to say moderate, sensible, and wise,"" Carlson told his audience. At another point in his program, Carlson mocked the ""Neo-con media establishment"" for suggesting Trump is a ""dangerous lunatic.""\n\nIt was all quite a sight to see coming from a man who has been exposed to hold Trump in great disdain, as evidenced by private messages he sent which have come to light as part of Dominion Voting Systems\' $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News.\n\nCarlson actually ""hate[s]"" Trump. And he hates him ""passionately."" He believes Trump is a ""destroyer."" A ""demonic force."" A president who was a ""disaster."" A politician whose behavior after losing the 2020 election was ""disgusting.""\n\nCarlson just doesn\'t have the courage to say any of it on television -- or apparently to the man whom he privately made such comments about.\n\nCarlson\'s refusal to disclose to his viewers his true opinions of Trump reflect the grip the former president still exerts over the Republican Party. Even Carlson, the most popular MAGA Media figure whom most of the GOP fears, thinks it is necessary to kiss the ring of Trump.\n\nIt\'s a broader phenomenon reflected across Fox News, as also revealed by private messages uncovered in Dominion\'s lawsuit. Even GOP kingmaker Rupert Murdoch appeared to fear Trump\'s wrath. And it speaks to what could happen in 2024 and beyond.\n\nRight-wing media stars like Carlson might want to move past Trump. Carlson, himself, confided in a producer after the 2020 election, ""We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can\'t wait.""\n\nBut the reality is it will be quite difficult to ignore him now that he is once again in the race for the White House and facing criminal charges. On Tuesday night, as Carlson bowed before Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he demonstrated exactly that. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/media/carlson-trump-interview/index.html"

"What we know about the fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker as grand jury considers the case The city of Akron, Ohio, is bracing for the findings of a special grand jury, which has been tasked with deciding if any of the eight police officers directly involved in the fatal shooting of Jayland Walker last summer will face criminal charges.\n\nThe shooting – in which Walker, who was Black, was shot dozens of times – came after police said the 25-year-old fled an attempted traffic stop early one morning last June. Walker\'s death prompted an investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, along with protests over racial injustice and police use of force – a few of which erupted into violence, resulting in damage to local businesses, according to Akron police.\n\nWalker was unarmed at the time he was killed, according to police, though a gun was found in his vehicle after the shooting, and officers said Walker fired a gun from his vehicle during the car chase.\n\nThe Ohio BCI investigation has been completed and was referred to the special prosecutor, a spokesperson for the Ohio Attorney General\'s Office confirmed to CNN last month. The office declined to comment on any matters related to grand jury proceedings.\n\nThe city and attorneys for Walker\'s family, however, acknowledged the grand jury review was underway in statements to CNN, with the latter criticizing the process as one that favored the police.\n\n""Today an Akron grand jury began its process of determining whether the officers who gunned down Jayland Walker last summer will be held criminally accountable for their actions,"" attorney Bobby DiCello said in a statement Monday.\n\n""As part of that process, as Ohio law allows, the officers will be invited to testify before the grand jury on their behalf. Keep in mind that if any other Akron citizen was accused of a crime, they would not necessarily be afforded that same privilege,"" he said. ""Simply put, it\'s a process that favors the officers.""\n\nCity officials hosted public meetings to address concerns about the grand jury proceedings and how any decision might impact the community. At one, Police Chief Stephen Mylett said he was ""anticipating that there is going to be a response from Akron and beyond.""\n\nThe city also has established a demonstration zone downtown, along with temporary barriers and fencing around court and municipal buildings – moves a city spokesperson described as purely precautionary.\n\nHere\'s what we know about the shooting of Jayland Walker:\n\nWhat police say happened\n\nWalker was killed in a burst of gunfire early June 27, 2022, following a vehicle pursuit and foot chase that started when officers tried to stop him for traffic and equipment violations.\n\nWalker fled the stop and officers gave chase, according to a narrated video timeline police played at a news conference July 3, when police released parts of body camera videos from 13 officers at the scene.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after the start of the pursuit, the narrated video said, ""a sound consistent with a gunshot can be heard"" in body camera footage, and the officers told dispatch a gunshot had been fired from Walker\'s vehicle. Police also showed still images taken from traffic cameras that showed ""a flash of light"" – purportedly a muzzle flash – along the driver\'s side of the car.\n\n""That changes the whole nature"" of the incident, Mylett said at the time, turning a ""routine traffic stop"" into a ""public safety issue.""\n\nAfter several minutes, Walker\'s vehicle slowed and he exited and ran, police said. Several police officers got out of their patrol cars and chased him, and officers deployed Tasers in an effort to stop him, police said, but were unsuccessful.\n\nMoments later, police said, Walker ""stopped and quickly turned towards the pursuing officers."" Mylett told reporters officers believed Walker was reaching towards his waist and they ""felt that Mr. Walker had turned and was motioning and moving into a firing position,"" Mylett said, and officers opened fire, killing him.\n\nWalker was handcuffed behind his back after the shooting – a move Mylett said was in accordance with department policy. Mylett indicated at a community event in late March that adjustments would be made to the policy.\n\nWalker had 46 wounds, medical examiner found\n\nWalker suffered 46 gunshot entrance or graze wounds, according to an autopsy by Summit County Medical Examiner Dr. Lisa Kohler, who found the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nPer Kohler, the wounds included:\n\n• 15 on Walker\'s torso, where he had internal injuries to his heart, lungs, liver, spleen, left kidney, intestines and multiple ribs.\n\n• 17 on his pelvis and upper legs, where the right major artery going to the leg and the bladder were injured and the pelvis and both femurs were broken.\n\n• One on his face, where the jaw broke.\n\n• Eight on his arms and right hand.\n\n• Five on his knees, right lower leg and right foot.\n\nThough police accused Walker of firing a gunshot out his vehicle\'s window, a gunshot residue test was not performed as part of the autopsy, Kohler said, explaining gunshot residue testing can detect specific particles related to the discharge of a firearm ""but the results of that testing is not conclusive as to whether the person did or did not fire a weapon.""\n\nThe FBI discontinued this testing in 2006, and Kohler said her office discontinued the collection of that sampling a decade later and no longer purchases collection kits.\n\n8 officers placed on leave, then reinstated\n\nEight police officers ""directly involved"" in the shooting were initially placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, according to department protocol, Mylett said.\n\nThey were reinstated by October 10, a decision Mylett attributed to ""staffing issues"" in comments to CNN affiliate WEWS, acknowledging ""there may be some community concern.""\n\nWhile back at work, the officers were not in uniform or responding to service calls, the Akron Police Department said.\n\nAccording to information released by the city, seven of the eight officers are White and one is Black.\n\n""The decision to deploy lethal force as well as the number of shots fired is consistent with use of force protocols and officers\' training,"" the Fraternal Order of Police Akron Lodge 7 said in a statement last year.\n\nWhat videos show\n\nThe week following the shooting, police released 13 videos from officers\' body cameras – eight from the officers directly involved in the shooting and five others from others who were at the scene.\n\nThe videos were released according to a city ordinance requiring video footage documenting an active police officer\'s use of force to be released within seven days of the incident.\n\nToward the end of the pursuit, some of the footage shows the silver car Walker was driving stopping before he begins to exit the driver\'s side.\n\nAt least one officer shouts, ""Let me see your hands,"" and tells him not to move. The video shows Walker getting back into the car, which slowly moves forward. He is then seen getting out of the passenger side door and running from officers.\n\nAt least one officer again yells for Walker to show his hands, one video shows. The foot chase continued for several seconds, before a series of gunshots ring out over seven seconds.\n\nThe videos end right after the gunshots were fired and do not depict police officers\' efforts to provide medical care, though police say they attempted first aid after the shooting.\n\nWalker was declared dead at the scene.\n\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act request, CNN obtained in early September 24 more heavily redacted video clips showing more than four hours of the shooting and its immediate aftermath.\n\nEach video contains several sections where the footage is blurred or blacked out, or where audio is muted. The city told CNN at the time this was done to redact officers\' identifying information.\n\nIn several videos, gunfire is heard for seven to eight seconds, followed by officers\' attempts to determine whether Walker is armed while he lies face-up and non-responsive on the ground.\n\n""Can anyone see the gun?"" one officer is heard repeatedly asking, as a group of officers stand with guns still aimed at Walker. ""Where is the weapon at?"" one is heard asking in several videos.\n\nSeveral officers are heard rendering first aid, shouting for light and asking for tourniquets and packing gauze.\n\nNone of the videos showed the inside of Walker\'s car, though some show officers approaching the vehicle after the shooting. ""It\'s got a firearm in it,"" one officer is heard saying.\n\nPolice are seen in other footage trying to sequester police who fired at Walker while discussing collecting their body-worn cameras. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/us/jayland-walker-shooting-grand-jury/index.html"

"Thomas revelation of gifts fits a broader pattern of financial nondisclosure from the Supreme Court The recent revelations of lavish gifts and travel that a Republican megadonor showered on Justice Clarence Thomas reflect a larger Supreme Court culture of nondisclosure, little explanation, and no comment.\n\nThe justices have provided less and less information regarding travel and gifts on their annual financial disclosure forms over the years. Earlier in the 2000s, for example, Thomas listed some private-plane travel similar in nature to some of the trips he later withheld which were detailed in a ProPublica report last week.\n\nIn a brief statement responding to the story of his relationship with billionaire real estate magnate Harlan Crow, Thomas said his colleagues and others in the judiciary had advised that he need not report ""this sort of hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court."" He did not reveal with whom he had conferred or whether Chief Justice John Roberts, who declined to comment, was consulted.\n\nThe incident reflects the broader lack of accountability at the high court regarding off-bench behavior. Justices regularly brush aside reporters\' queries for specifics on travel and gifts, book advances and other extracurricular activities.\n\nThey have repeatedly spurned calls by members of Congress that they adopt a formal ethics code. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin made another such plea to Roberts this week as he also urged the chief justice to open an investigation into Thomas\' conduct.\n\nAt the same time, the high court has long benefited from a certain degree of good will, free of the scrutiny watchdog groups and news media have given the legislative and executive branches of government.\n\nThey may have squandered that good will.\n\nPolls show the public approval of the court – now controlled by a conservative supermajority – plunging. The pattern was accelerated after last summer\'s reversal of longstanding precedent in multiple cases, most notably the decision dissolving nearly a half century of abortion rights precedent.\n\nLack of formal ethics code\n\nThe justices\' outside activities have increasingly been in the spotlight as they\'ve dithered on whether to adopt a formal code of conduct that applies to lower federal court judges.\n\nThey have been discussing such a code, at least back to May 2019 when Justice Elena Kagan told a congressional committee that Roberts was in the process of developing a formal policy for the justices. ""It\'s something that is being thought very seriously about,"" Kagan said at the time.\n\nThe court\'s Public Information Office has declined to provide any update on the status of possible discussions related to court ethics.\n\nThe justices are covered by federal law regarding annual financial disclosures and a requirement that they disqualify themselves from a case when their ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned,"" but they are exempt from a broader judicial code of conduct that applies to lower court judges.\n\nThere is also no process for receiving and resolving complaints against justices, as exists for judges on US district and regional appellate benches. If ethics complaints are lodged against a lower court jurist who is being elevated to the Supreme Court, those complaints will be dismissed when he or she becomes a justice, as happened in 2018 with Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe annual financial disclosure forms contain investments, other income (such as from lectures and books) and information about gifts and reimbursements for travel and lodging. The specifics of those categories, including whether spouses also went along, have thinned over the decades.\n\nGabe Roth of the watchdog group Fix the Court said that while fewer specifics have appeared on the public forms over the past two decades, there has long been an internal inconsistency among filings from the nine justices.\n\nSome justices appeared to reveal more, some less, and no mechanism exists to ensure compliance.\n\nChief justice on the spot\n\nRoberts, who became chief justice in 2005, has continually described the high court as beyond the realm of politics and worthy of public trust.\n\n""I think the most import thing for the public to understand is that we are not a political branch of government,"" he said in a 2009 C-SPAN interview. ""They don\'t elect us. If they don\'t like what we\'re doing, it\'s more or less just too bad.""\n\nHe noted that the only way to remove a justice is through impeachment by the US House of Representatives and Senate conviction.\n\nTwo years later, in an annual report, Roberts offered his most extensive comments to date about potential conflicts of interest among the nine justices and when they decide to recuse themselves, that is, sit out a case because of a potential conflict of interest.\n\n""I have complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted,"" Roberts wrote. ""They are jurists of exceptional integrity and experience whose character and fitness have been examined through a rigorous appointment and confirmation process. … We are all deeply committed to the common interest in preserving the Court\'s vital role as an impartial tribunal governed by the rule of law.""\n\nWhile the chief justice sits atop the federal judiciary, he has no real authority over his eight colleagues. And he has said the court ""does not sit in judgment of"" its own members.\n\nJust as Roberts declined to respond to the ProPublica report about Thomas\' travel on Crow\'s private jet and superyacht, he refused questions last year regarding news reports of evangelical leaders who tried to influence justices with dinners and entertainment.\n\nCongressional Democrats urge investigation\n\nAfter the April 6 ProPublica report about the luxurious travel Crow provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, several members of Congress and critics again called on Chief Justice Roberts to act.\n\nTwenty-four Democratic members of Congress, led by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. Hank Johnson, who chair committees overseeing the federal courts, urged Roberts to undertake a, ""swift, thorough, independent and transparent investigation"" into whether Thomas violated any laws or ethics rules.\n\nSeparately, Durbin said in his Monday letter, joined by fellow Democrats from the Senate Judiciary Committee, that members want to ensure ""that the nation\'s highest court does not have the federal judiciary\'s lowest ethical standards.""\n\nSuch rhetoric, unaccompanied in this episode by any Republican outcry, has simply faded in the past.\n\nAs Roberts has observed, there is little leverage against life-time appointees. And he and his colleagues continue to act as if they are above it all.\n\nIf any of the justices finds this state of affairs concerning, they have not made it public.\n\nOne could imagine that at some point a justice might consider the mantra of Roberts himself, memorably uttered as he dissented from the bench in 2015 on a separate matter: ""Just who do we think we are? https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/clarence-thomas-gifts-nondisclosure-pattern-supreme-court/index.html"
"Sen. Hagerty, after South America trip, warns China moving to step into 'vacuum' left by US Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., discusses the U.S. response to a Russian jet downing an American drone and weighs in on President Biden\'s defense budget on \'America Reports.\'\n\nSen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., is warning that the Chinese communist regime is looking to take advantage of a ""vacuum"" left behind by the U.S. in South America -- after a trip to the region where he heard from top government officials first-hand.\n\nHagerty, a former businessman and diplomat, visited Uruguay and Chile last week as part of a congressional delegation to the area, while also heading to Colombia by himself. Included in the visits were meetings with the presidents of each country, as well as top government officials including foreign ministers.\n\nHagerty told Fox News Digital that he saw how those countries have basic economic problems and are in the process of trying to develop their economies, and how the Chinese are trying to exploit that.\n\n""Basic economic problems were exacerbated by the pandemic shutdowns that took place. So they\'re trying to emerge from the pandemic with underperforming economies and with much higher crime rates. And in that situation, the United States has left a vacuum,"" he said. ""We have not shown up as we should have with our neighbors here in our own hemisphere.""\n\n""China\'s good at seeing the vacuum and seeing the opportunity, and they\'re stepping up and taking advantage of it,"" he said.\n\nCHINA DENIES FUELING FENTANYL CRISIS: \'THE ROOT CAUSE LIES IN THE US ITSELF\'\n\nSen. Bill Hagerty meets with President Gustavo Petro of Colombia. (Office of Sen. Bill Hagerty)\n\nHagerty warned how China has stepped in elsewhere across the globe such as in Saudi Arabia, where they had brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But, while he blamed the Biden administration for the Chinese-Saudi moves, he said the vacuum in South America has been developing for some time.\n\n""I think this has been going on for administrations both Republican and Democrat. This is not an immediate problem, but it\'s been exacerbated tremendously by the pandemic,"" he said.\n\nHe noted that Colombia has not had a U.S. ambassador now for two year and said the U.S. ""needs to take these challenges seriously and step up and not allow these voids to continue.""\n\nHe described a move by China that sees Chinese-backed bidders for infrastructure come in and negotiate hard to lower standards and specifications, and then undercut any American bidder in the region.\n\nCHINA, RUSSIA REVERT TO PRE-1989 WORLD AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHALLENGE THE US-LED WEST\n\n""They\'re coming in and trying to invest in major infrastructure projects, whether it be telecommunications infrastructure, think Huawei. Or ports, strategic infrastructure of that nature, the software to manage ports, to track shipments. All of these are areas where the Chinese are very strategically focused,"" he said.\n\n""They\'re looking for areas where they exert strategic control over the economy and the people of those nations. And in doing so, they can begin to come in and pull Latin America away from the United States,"" he warned. ""They are establishing a presence in our backyard.""\n\nHowever, Hagerty is not pessimistic, and believes that the region would prefer to have the U.S. as its main ally, and that the U.S. can provide that help if it steps up to invest in the region.\n\n""We have the advantage, we have a logistical advantage, we have a long history. We need to be finding ways to work together,"" he said.\n\nHe said the countries in the region ""need economic cooperation, they need technical logical cooperation, they need infrastructure, and they need investment by U.S. firms where the opportunity warrants.""\n\nThe Tennessee senator focused particularly on supply chains, getting them out of China and if they are not moving back to the U.S. then at least getting them back to the Western Hemisphere.\n\n""I use the term ""friend-shoring"" to bring those supply chains that aren\'t going to make it back to the United States, to neighboring countries that have less logistical risk because they\'re near and also help us build stronger economic and strategic ties with our neighbors that over time will make, you know, our bloc in the Western Hemisphere stronger than any other in the world,"" he said.\n\nHagerty also said that Washington needs to reconsider restrictions placed on development agencies like the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and how that is deployed under the 2018 BUILD Act in order to deal with competition from Beijing.\n\n""We need to be able to look at strategic projects that will benefit not only the host nation whose our ally, but also that will benefit the United States of America and help our economic growth and help our economic linkages with those countries -- whether it be to increase U.S. exports or to provide other economic or strategic opportunities for America,"" he said. ""Those considerations should be first and foremost as we think about how we deploy, you know, our development finance tools and tools that will support building infrastructure in other nations.""\n\nUltimately, Hagerty believes that there is potential bipartisan support for such a move and that a push to beat China\'s state-controlled capitalism with an American market-based capitalism in the region would be successful.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n""While I see significant challenges in our hemisphere today, I see much greater opportunity. And that opportunity comes from the fact that we have, you know, a natural that we have natural alliances in our hemisphere. We have very real opportunities and most of them are based on economic need,"" he said.\n\n""And a market based economy like the United States is far better suited to help our allies in the Western Hemisphere address those market-based opportunities than any solution that would be provided by China in the short run,"" he said.

"The left is hell-bent on killing these great cities, and yours National FOP Vice President Joe Gamaldi blasts Mayor-elect Brandon Johnson\'s criminal justice policies on \'Unfiltered.\'\n\nMark down Tuesday, April 4, as the night Chicago died.\n\nThat\'s when we learned that Second City voters narrowly elected Brandon Johnson as their next mayor. This is a city that was flattened during the reign of Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who lost in the first round of voting for Chicago mayor because she didn\'t finish in one of the top two spots.\n\nLightfoot, elected in 2019 after a career as a federal prosecutor who then held several appointed positions in Chicago, shut down the city for more than a year during COVID-19. She also bankrupted small businesses, allowed rioters to burn down whole neighborhoods, presided over the worst crime wave in 50 years and let the schools go to hell.\n\nNow, the voters have selected Johnson. Elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2018, Johnson narrowly won the mayoralty of America\'s third-most-populous city on April 4 over Paul Vallas, a former Chicago schools CEO and a Democrat who presented himself as a political moderate compared to the far-left Johnson.\n\nCHICAGO MAYOR-ELECT BRANDON JOHNSON REBUKES \'LARGE CORPORATIONS\' FOR POVERTY, VIOLENCE IN THE CITY\n\nThe incoming mayor may turn out to be a worse mayor than Lightfoot. Johnson\'s occupation is an organizer for the teachers unions. The unions spent several million dollars on the race. They got their man.\n\nWelcome to the real-world impact of progressivism. Instead of worker paradises, the left has transitioned our once-shining cities into slums, murder zones, homeless encampments and boarded-up stores\n\nWhat this means is that Chicago\'s municipal government will now be a fully owned subsidiary of the Chicago Teachers Union. (Can you imagine what the union contracts are going to look like?) This is a city where, in roughly two dozen schools, zero children can read or write at proficiency level.\n\nJohnson said that crime and shoplifting from local schools are societal problems. And he may continue Lightfoot\'s policy of not prosecuting people who rob stores -- often owned by minorities.\n\nIt\'s not just Chicago that has become a war zone. Portland, Seattle and San Francisco were not so long ago the crown jewels of the West Coast. They were said to be progressive cities that worked. No more. Now, they are unlivable. San Francisco is overrun with homeless people on seemingly every downtown street corner, feces on the sidewalks and trash everywhere.\n\nLORI LIGHTFOOT TORPEDOED AFTER LOSING RE-ELECTION BID: \'GOOD RIDDANCE!\'\n\nIn Portland, major businesses are pulling out in the aftermath of the takeover of the radical anarchists during COVID-19. Crime is so rampant that Walmart recently said ""adios,"" shutting down its last store.\n\nRains PDX, a clothing store in Portland, shut down last November after a string of break-ins made it impossible to stay open. This printed sign pasted on the door says it all:\n\n""Small businesses (and large) cannot sustain doing business, in our city\'s current state. We have no protection, or recourse, against the criminal behavior that goes unpunished. Do not be fooled into thinking that insurance companies cover losses. We have sustained 15 break-ins ... We have not received any financial reimbursement since the 3rd.""\n\nFor the first time, Seattle is losing population. To be ""progressive,"" Seattle is imposing a massive capital gains tax increase -- socking it to the rich. So they are fleeing the city and Washington state.\n\nHOMELESS ENCAMPMENT HAS PORTLAND RESIDENTS BEGGING FOR HELP, SCARED TO GO OUTSIDE: \'ABSOLUTELY HELPLESS\'\n\nOne of the nation\'s top demographers, Wendell Cox, has been analyzing the just-released Census Bureau data on county population. He found that ""during the late 2010s and before the pandemic, population growth and domestic migration transitioned toward smaller metropolitan areas from larger ones. That outmigration is accelerating.""\n\nThe nation\'s 10 largest counties have lost more than 1 million residents since 2019. The biggest losers have been the counties that are home to New York and San Francisco and Chicago\'s Cook County. Even Los Angeles County, the nation\'s most populous county, with just under 10 million people, is now contracting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWelcome to the real-world impact of progressivism. Instead of worker paradises, the left has transitioned our once-shining cities into slums, murder zones, homeless encampments and boarded-up stores. They have become cults of economic and political quackery -- and tragically, few Democrats have the courage to speak out. They are worried about being called racists when the reality is that the victims -- of terrible public schools, high murder rates and an anti-business creed -- are the minorities they say they care so much about.\n\nThe three poisons of America\'s leftist cities are 1) high taxes, 2) schools that don\'t educate and 3) crime running rampant. As mayors such as Rudy Giuliani of New York City proved in the 1990s after the Big Apple had been driven to its knees, all it takes is committed leadership to fix these problems.

"How Will IBM Stock Trend Post Q1 Earnings? A logo of IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) sits on their offices at Yeouido, the ... [ ] financial district on October 13, 2020 in Seoul, South Korea. (Photo by Chris Jung/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nComputing behemoth IBM IBM is slated to report its Q1 2023 results on April 19th. We estimate that IBM's revenue will come in at about $14.40 billion for the quarter, marginally ahead of the consensus estimate of about $14.35 billion and roughly flat versus last year. We estimate that earnings will stand at close to $1.26 per share, compared to a consensus of $1.27 per share. So, what are some of the trends that are likely to drive IBM's earnings?\n\nWe expect IBM's core software and services operations to be one of the key drivers of growth over Q1. The software segment, which accounted for a little over 40% of the company's revenue last year, grew by about 8% in constant currency terms in Q4, driven by the Red Hat RHT and automation businesses. Red Hat, which was acquired in 2019 has been a key driver for IBM, given its large portfolio of open-source technology, its hybrid cloud platform, and its large developer community. Over the last quarter, IBM expanded Red Hat's reach by signing new partnership agreements with Oracle ORCL and SAP. We will also be closely watching the performance of the Data & AI subsegment of the software business. With the success of the viral ChatGPT chatbot, investors are becoming more enthusiastic about the role AI could play in the economy and we will be looking for updates on IBM's developments on that front.\n\nWe think IBM stock is likely to move sideways following its Q1 results. At the current market price of about $131 per share, IBM stock trades at just just under 14x consensus 2023 earnings. This makes the stock a reasonably good value pick in a market where investors are increasingly prioritizing earnings and cash flows. The company's trailing dividend yield stands at about 5%. Moreover, IBM could also hold up reasonably well in the event of an economic downturn in the United States. CEO Arvind Krishna previously indicated that he expects technology-related spending to continue to expand despite fears over rising interest rates, inflation, and tightness in the labor markets.

"How 2022 Became a Record Year for US Income Taxes Americans paid out an estimated 14.7% of personal income in 2022 in what the US Bureau of Economic Analysis calls personal current taxes (mainly federal, state and local income taxes), an all-time high. But don't worry, the percentage will be lower in 2023.\n\nThis record-setting income tax burden, and the sharp increase since 2020 that brought it to this level, was not due to new tax legislation taking effect during this period. It also wasn't really expected -- the Congressional Budget Office greatly underestimated how much income tax revenue would flow into federal coffers last year. It seems to have been the result of a pandemic asset-price boom interacting with inflation, a progressive tax code and, in a few states, the aftereffects of tax legislation enacted by Congress in 2017. The first two effects are fading, and the BEA's monthly estimates of personal current taxes show that rates have already retraced more than half their pandemic increase since last summer. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-12/how-2022-became-a-record-year-for-us-income-taxes"

Tim Scott of South Carolina on Wednesday took a major step towards running for the White House as he launched a presidential exploratory committee.\n\nShowcasing his message of faith, hope, and unity, Scott emphasized in a video that was shared first with Fox News that ""this is the fight we must win. And that will take faith. Faith in God, faith in each other, and faith in America.""\n\nThe senator recorded his video by Fort Sumter National Monument, the island fort that long protected Charleston, South Carolina, where the first battle in the Civil War was fought. Scott, who grew up in the Charleston area, is launching his presidential exploratory committee on the 162nd anniversary of Civil War\'s start.\n\n""On this day, April 12, 1861, in this harbor, the first shots of the Civil War were fired and our country faced the defining moment: Would we truly be one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

"Wetzel's Pretzels is launching a new store concept aimed at Gen Z and millennials &ndash; take a look inside California pretzel chain Wetzel\'s Pretzels is launching a new store concept specifically targeting Gen Z and millennials.\n\nTwisted, as the new stores will be called, will sell innovative takes on the typical pretzel. There\'ll be both sweet and savory options available, ranging from pretzel chimney cakes – ice cream served inside a cone made from sugar-coated pretzel dough – to a pretzel version of loaded fries, with toppings including bacon and s\'mores ingredients.\n\nOther menu items include $7.99 cheese-stuffed pretzel twists and hot dogs served in pretzel buns with spicy toppings.\n\nWetzel\'s Pretzels currently has around 370 stores, with 40% located in California. Most of its stores are in malls, though some are in store-within-a-store formats, like in a Walmart or Macy\'s, or at locations like Disney World, Universal CityWalk, and LAX airport.\n\nBut people aren\'t shopping at malls as much anymore. Changes in shopping habits, including online retail, have led to the closure of hundreds of malls across the US.\n\nWith Twisted, Wetzel\'s Pretzels will be steering clear of shopping malls. Wetzel\'s Pretzels CMO Kim Freer told Insider that the company would instead target college towns and power centers, which are outdoor shopping centers with multiple big-box tenants.\n\n""Twisted was created for a Zillennial guest,"" Freer said. She said that the stores – each around 1,200 square feet in size – would feature bright colors and eye-catching decor. They\'ll also have open kitchens where customers can watch their pretzels being baked and decorated.\n\nThe first Twisted store will be open 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., but Freer said that she expects it to be at its busiest in the late afternoon and evening.\n\nThough pretzels are generally seen as a snack item, Freer said that some of the items on Twisted\'s menu were bigger portions that could take the place of a meal. ""Pretzels can be so much more,"" she said.\n\nFreer noted, however, that during the pandemic people had been snacking more and ""grazing throughout the day,"" pushing up Wetzel\'s Pretzels 2022 sales to around 35% higher than in 2019.\n\nFreer said that Wetzel\'s Pretzels planned to open around 40 new stores between now and the end of 2023, with at least three being Twisted stores. The first will open in Orange County in May, with two more following later this year in California and Arizona. https://www.businessinsider.com/wetzels-pretzels-twisted-store-concept-sweet-savory-gen-z-millennials-2023-4"
"A millennial tried out the TikTok-famous cash stuffing budget method &mdash; and said it helped her pay off a $19,000 car loan ahead of schedule Berenice Rodriguez, a 29-year-old dental assistant in North Carolina, said she used to have a bad relationship with money and spent way too much on eating out and things she didn\'t need.\n\n""The most confusing part of this journey was figuring out where my money went,"" Rodriguez told Insider. ""I paid my bills, but everything else felt like it went down the drain.""\n\nBut in June 2020, Rodriguez said, she heard about a budgeting method called cash stuffing through a TikTok video. She said it turned her financial situation around.\n\nRodriguez and her partner paid off their $19,000 car purchase earlier than expected and have saved over $11,000 toward a home, documents viewed by Insider showed.\n\nCash stuffing involves using envelopes to divide up cash for rent, groceries, gas, and other things. TikTok videos with the hashtag #cashstuffing have collectively been viewed over 970 million times.\n\nWhen Rodriguez gets paid, she said, she takes the money out of the bank and stuffs it in envelopes designated for different budget categories or financial goals.\n\n""Cash stuffing has been tremendously helpful to me,"" she said. ""I see where my money is going, and when I stuff my money, it forces me to only spend the certain amount that is in that envelope.""\n\nLast year Rodriguez joined the ranks of TikTok cash stuffers -- she documents her budgeting journey for over 11,000 followers. She said she does this to hold herself accountable and motivate others to give cash stuffing a try.\n\nMany Americans have seen inflation take a toll on their finances, and a surge in interest in cash stuffing suggests many people are open to trying something different to get their budgets in line.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it found that US credit-card debt rose by $61 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, the largest increase in the history of its data, which dates back to 1999. While older borrowers missed credit-card payments and became delinquent about as often as they did before the pandemic, Americans in their 20s and 30s had higher delinquency rates than they did pre-pandemic, the New York Fed said.\n\nWhile Rodriguez attributed much of her financial improvement to cash stuffing, she said the journey hadn\'t been easy.\n\nShe said that early on she\'d often go way over budget on certain categories and have to use funds from other envelopes. But as she monitored her expenses over time, she said, she figured out numbers that worked for her budget.\n\nShe said that every two weeks, when she and her partner get paid, she allocates $300 for their future home, $230 for groceries, $120 for her two dogs (and $50 for the dogs\' emergency fund), $100 for takeout, $100 for fun, $100 for vacations, $30 for beauty and health, and $30 for miscellaneous expenses. (Other categories get inconsistent amounts.)\n\nShe said that while her budget is more consistent than it used to be, she still has to make some tweaks every so often. Her grocery budget used to be $200, for instance, but she said that higher food prices caused her to increase it to $230 in March.\n\nRodriguez said she keeps the money for her rent and utilities in her bank account. When she has extra cash in certain envelopes at the end of the month, she lets it roll over to the next month.\n\nShe said that while she tries to buy things with cash as often as she can, when she buys something online with a credit card she deposits cash from that designated envelope into her bank account and then pays off the card balance.\n\nRodriguez described cash stuffing as easy to learn and adapt, but she said that getting started had its challenges.\n\n""Seeing your debt can be really overwhelming,"" she said. ""You just have to remember why you are doing this, why you are starting this journey and what is your overall goal. When I have hard times with money, I remember that my end goal is a house for my little family.""\n\nWhile persistent inflation is a good reason for Americans to get their budgets in order, Rodriguez said it\'s also the reason she doesn\'t put every dollar to her name in a physical envelope.\n\nCash stuffed in an envelope generates a return of 0% -- so when prices rise, this cash gets less valuable. Rodriguez said that for her medium- to long-term savings goals she puts money in certificates of deposit or retirement accounts; she said that when she does this, she puts fake placeholder bills in envelopes to represent the cash.\n\nBut for short-term expenses like groceries, Rodriguez said, the benefits of cash stuffing outweigh what she sees as the cost: a relatively small return in a savings account.\n\n""At the end of the day, cash stuffing is a tool to get you to your goals,"" she said. ""There will be trial and error as you learn what works for you, but once you get there and see the results, that is going to be the motivation to keep going.""\n\nHave you tried cash stuffing and are willing to share your story?

Strategists pointed to an aging population, geopolitical fragmentation, and the transition to a lower-carbon world as factors that will keep inflation high.\n\nIn their view, getting inflation down to target will ultimately require a ""major recession.""\n\nWhat\'s your inflation outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023?

"The wild traffic hack that could pave the way for self-driving cars Someday, maybe, you\'ll be driving like usual, and you\'ll stop at a red light, as usual. You\'ll take the opportunity to sneak a peek at the car next to you, and the guy behind that wheel -- if there\'s a wheel at all -- will be watching Netflix. His car will be driving itself, as will many of the others around you. It\'ll be a bumper-to-bumper jumble of robots and humans.\n\nIf all the cars were robots, maybe you wouldn\'t even need the traffic light. The self-driving vehicles would just ping their vectors at each other, and collective computation would choreograph their passage through the intersection in a nimble, mechanical ballet. But throw a few meatbags in there jockeying for pole position, and -- well, every flicker from green to red becomes a car crash waiting to happen. You might be able to get out of the way of a testosterone-fueled human driver in an SUV, but the self-driving cars will never see him coming.\n\nUnless, that is, you\'re in the digital paradise conjured by Ali Hajbabaie, a civil engineer at North Carolina State University. Hajbabaie envisions a state of complete harmony between humans and machines, a chimeric intersection where we all just get along. It relies on a single technological trick -- an ingenious hack of the traffic ecosystem. When the light changes, it\'s not red, or yellow, or green. It\'s white -- and white means: ""Robots, go! Humans, follow!""\n\nThe big idea here is that self-driving cars aren\'t the problem. It\'s not their fault that they crash into police cars, manifest weird flocking behavior, and go on strike. What autonomous vehicles need, the thinking goes, are smarter roads. Our streets are designed for human drivers. Hajbabaie wants to rewire the traffic infrastructure to control the flow of both people and robots. ""The end goal,"" he says, ""is to bring connected self-driving-car technology into traffic-control systems, to make intersections safer and more environmentally friendly.""\n\nLots of traffic lights and their timing are already computer-controlled. But in Hajbabaie\'s futuristic vision, cars -- especially the self-driving ones -- would wirelessly communicate with those computers, with one another, and maybe even with people\'s cellphones. That\'s known as ""Vehicle-to-Everything,"" or V2X, and it\'s the key to Hajbabaie\'s plan. His ""white-phase intersections"" would trigger robot cars to take the lead. They would enter the intersections first, updating one another on their trajectories and altering course as needed to avoid collisions. Human drivers would trail behind in what traffic-flow theorists call ""platoons,"" comforted that the white traffic light was telling everyone -- and everything -- when and where to move. And if things start to go off the rails, whether it\'s the humans or the robots messing up, the whole thing just defaults back to red light/green light.\n\nIn simulations, the benefits of white lights kick in when as few as 10% of the cars on the road are robots. (Hajbabaie and his team don\'t just create digital models -- they also have 15 toy-size cars, each about a foot long and equipped with cameras and lidar, that they can put through white-phase paces.) ""In our tests, we observe 3% or so reduction in travel time,"" Hajbabaie says. As more self-driving cars enter the market, speed through Hajbabaie\'s intersections goes up and fuel consumption goes down. Greenlight the white light, and we\'re merging onto the road to the future.\n\nMaybe -- but it\'s not quite that simple. The elaborate regulatory system that has risen up around cars is a product of societal priorities and policies. Green lights and speed bumps -- all the furniture of our built environment -- are as much politics and culture as design and tech. That\'s why it can feel impossible to build a protected bike lane on a popular shopping street or permit a parklet outside a restaurant, much less build a new trolley line or a high-speed rail system. A radically redesigned traffic light? Good luck getting that approved by your city transportation department before automobiles are replaced by flying cars.\n\nThe color of Hajbabaie\'s robot light, to be clear, is arbitrary. He doesn\'t actually care whether it\'s white. That\'s just for convenience in his team\'s papers. ""We want to let human-driven vehicles know that self-driving cars are controlling the intersection,"" he says. ""If it\'s hard for someone to distinguish between colors, we don\'t want to put a color there that\'s problematic.""\n\nIn fact, red means stop and green means go only because people foisted those meanings on them. As the historian Clay McShane wrote, early traffic-light engineers chose red and green because railroad signals used them. Railroads got the idea from ships; coastal lighthouses used red (the most transparent stained-glass color in 1806) so mariners could tell lighthouses apart from the sea, and green was the color the British admiralty decreed for the starboard side of ships in the 1850s. The thing is, about 8% of men of European descent and 5% of men of Asian descent have trouble distinguishing red and green. (The incidence is lower in women.) But in 1923, when a traffic engineer proposed switching the 500 or so traffic lights in the US to blue and yellow, his colleagues nixed the idea. They thought drivers wouldn\'t be able to make the switch, and worried that acknowledging the problem would make them look dumb.\n\nA few hyperlocal radicals tried to defy traffic standardization. In Manhattan, Broadway had the familiar red/green setup, but Fifth Avenue used orange lights to mean go, green lights for the cross streets to go, and red to mean caution. No problem, except that Fifth and Broadway intersect at Madison Square. There, McShane wrote, ""chaos would eventually ensue."" Fifth Avenue, like the rest of the world, soon yielded to the red/green hegemony.\n\nWhat ultimately shaped all the new traffic rules, as with every question of public policy, was power and privilege. ""The way our roads are built -- the things that changed the 1890s city to the kind of city we have today -- a lot of that came out of conflict between the rights and responsibilities of different kinds of road users,"" says Cameron Roberts, a sustainability and transportation researcher at the University of Wisconsin. The people who could afford cars were a rich and powerful constituency. They eventually got what they wanted: speed and ""freedom."" People build roads, new tech fills them up, and then the road builders have to figure out how to respond. That\'s how we wound up redesigning cities that favored cars and suburban sprawl. In the battle between the Model T and pedestrians, the pedestrians never stood a chance.\n\nThe same will be true of proposals like white traffic lights for self-driving cars. ""If we\'re talking about this new kind of infrastructure, a fourth phase of light, you might say it solves a problem,"" Roberts says. ""But the real question is: solves a problem for whom? And what interests and power do they have to motivate that in practice?"" If self-driving cars ever move beyond shared services like taxis and deliveries, the first vehicles are going to be owned by wealthy people. Should they get a privileged lane, or a special traffic light devoted to their convenience?\n\n""There\'s going to be a certain social set using these things, and they will be much like the earliest motorists -- powerful and well-connected,"" Roberts says. ""I would not have a lot of confidence that something like this would be implemented in a way that is considerate of the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and public-transit users.""\n\nFor the moment, cities are in no danger of being overrun by self-driving cars. The technology seems to have stalled. Investor reports still quote bullish numbers for the eventual size of the autonomous-vehicle market, but the Google-derived robot-car company Waymo, once valued at about $200 billion, now idles at about $30 billion -- in line with its competitor Cruise. ""I would love a self-driving car, even for double the price of my car,"" says Greg Shill, a law professor at the University of Iowa who specializes in transportation. ""But the tech is just not there. These things don\'t exist, and you can\'t even persuade investors that they\'re going to exist soon.""\n\nYet even as a hypothetical, there\'s something delightfully science-fictional about the idea of slapping a fourth light on traffic signals to make way for robots. (I think this actually happens on the reliably predictive TV show ""Futurama,"" but I can\'t find the episode.) It\'s the kind of thing you\'d see on a planet covered by a single giant city, swarming with flying cars. Maybe a truly multimodal intersection could have as many colors as an LED screen can manage, one for every kind of thing that might pass through it -- with an algorithm making way for drones, delivery trucks, robot cars, people using wheelchairs, unaccompanied 6-year-olds, ducklings, whatever.\n\nAs a thought experiment, the idea of a white-light intersection also forces us to reconsider the automotive infrastructure we take for granted. Our traffic regime is an old one, originally designed for horses and carriages, not for F-150s or self-driving vehicles. In recent years, cities have begun to change their car-centric ways, carving up streets and changing the rules of the road to favor bikes and pedestrians and public transportation over gas-guzzling, climate-warming, street-clogging vehicles. Do we really want to reverse all that progress and re-reshape our surroundings for robots?\n\nHajbabaie knows his sci-fi-sounding proposal is up for debate. It assumes the communication among cars will be nearly perfect and instantaneous, which will ring false for anyone who has tried to get their printer connected to their WiFi. V2X, the network of vehicle interconnectivity it would depend on, has never really worked. And Hajbabaie\'s team has yet to publish its findings on what happens when they introduce pedestrians into their simulations. (Yikes.)\n\n""We are engineers,"" he says. ""All we can do is do a lot of education and outreach, show what kinds of changes people can expect to see. Show the benefits, show the drawbacks, be honest, and let them decide."" It\'s not just a matter of how well the new technology performs. White traffic lights signal more than whether to stop or go -- they also signal our values, and illuminate the kind of world we want to build.\n\nAdam Rogers is a senior correspondent at Insider. https://www.businessinsider.com/fourth-color-traffic-lights-streets-self-driving-robot-cars-trucks-2023-4"
"A Liberal Victory in Wisconsin On Tuesday of last week, Ann Walsh Bradley, the senior justice on Wisconsin\'s Supreme Court, waited nervously with two colleagues in a room in a Milwaukee hotel. There was a vacancy on the court, which has seven seats, and the state had just held an election, between Janet Protasiewicz, a local circuit judge, and Daniel Kelly, a conservative former justice, to fill it. Bradley and her two colleagues are liberals; conservatives have controlled the court since 2008. A few dozen of Protasiewicz\'s family members and friends were milling around, drinking and chatting, but the three justices were focussed on their phones as the results trailed in from across the state. Less than an hour after the polls closed, word came in that Protasiewicz had won. Bradley embraced the other justices and burst into tears. ""At least for me--and I think for the people of the state--this is a long time coming,"" she said. ""I\'ve been on the court for twenty-eight years, and I\'ve never served with what is labelled a liberal majority, one that sees the role of government and democracy the way that I do.""\n\nSoon after, at a hotel in Green Lake, a small resort town in central Wisconsin, Kelly delivered a concession speech that quickly drew notoriety for its vitriol. ""I do not have a worthy opponent to which I can concede,"" Kelly said. He called Protasiewicz a ""serial liar"" and said that her campaign was ""beneath contempt"" and ""despicable."" He concluded with a petulant goodbye. ""I wish Wisconsin the best of luck,"" he said. ""Because I think it\'s going to need it.""\n\nProtasiewicz, a progressive, won by eleven points, a margin that qualifies as a drubbing in the closely divided state, where a two- or three-point victory has been referred to as a ""Wisconsin landslide."" The result could reshape the state\'s political geography. Protasiewicz\'s supporters were fuelled by anger over a nineteenth-century abortion law, resurrected after the U.S. Supreme Court\'s Dobbs decision, that bans the procedure except to save the life of the mother, and over the state\'s partisan gerrymandering, which has insured Republican control of the legislature since 2011. It offers the first chance to reverse the structural changes implemented since then, including the decimation of labor rights, the restriction of voting rights, and the dismantling of environmental regulations.\n\nProtasiewicz outperformed expectations in solidly Democratic areas, such as Dane County, the second-most populous in the state, where she won eighty-two per cent of the vote. She made significant inroads in suburban counties that have been Republican strongholds for generations, and reclaimed most of the Driftless Area, a swath of twenty-two counties in western Wisconsin, with a tradition of economic populism, that had been trending rightward. There were other races on the ballot last week, and Democratic mayors in Racine and Green Bay, who have been under siege by Stop the Steal activists since 2020, won crucial reëlections. ""Wisconsin now has a path to becoming a democracy,"" Ben Wikler, the chairman of the state\'s Democratic Party, told me. ""This was a landslide that represented a voter uprising against an authoritarian movement which for twelve years sought to impose minority rule.""\n\nNot long ago, the conservative conquest of Wisconsin looked irreversible. In 2011, Governor Scott Walker signed Act 10, which virtually eliminated collective-bargaining rights for public employees, the most significant attack on labor in the United States in thirty years. (A so-called right-to-work law followed.) During Walker\'s tenure, Republicans also gutted campaign-finance laws, and passed one of the most restrictive voter-I.D. laws in the country. Meanwhile, the gerrymandering made Republican legislators virtually impervious to electoral defeat. (According to the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, the Wisconsin State Senate is by far the most gerrymandered legislative body in the United States, with a partisan bias that favors Republicans by nearly twenty percentage points.)\n\nDecades of deindustrialization and the monopolization of agriculture had hollowed out key sectors of the state\'s economy, making it rife for a politics of resentment, which Walker actively stoked. He once told a wealthy Republican donor that he would use a ""divide-and-conquer"" strategy to break the labor movement. In the 2016 Presidential election, Donald Trump narrowly won Wisconsin, which sealed his victory in the Electoral College. The Wisconsin Supreme Court was ruled by a 5–2 conservative majority. The following year, in a state Supreme Court race, liberals did not even field a candidate.\n\nAfter Trump\'s victory, ""divide and conquer"" seemed like a painfully ironic epitaph for a state with a pioneering progressive legacy: it had created the country\'s first workers\'-compensation law, implemented the first state income tax, and was the first to recognize collective-bargaining rights for public employees. Much of the New Deal, in fact, including Social Security, was crafted by Wisconsinites influenced by their state\'s homegrown social-democratic tradition, which emphasized income equality, restraints on corporate power, and support for public institutions, clean elections, and transparent government.\n\nFor years, national Democrats largely ignored what was happening in Wisconsin. During the protests against Act 10, in 2011, which lasted for weeks and drew one and a half million people, President Barack Obama failed to show up, despite a campaign pledge that he would ""put on a comfortable pair of shoes"" and ""walk on that picket line with you"" if collective bargaining was ever under attack. The next year, when Walker faced a recall election sparked by the protest movement, Obama declined to campaign with his opponent. (A flood of dark money helped Walker survive the recall.) In 2016, Hillary Clinton didn\'t once campaign in Wisconsin during the general election. After her defeat, she did pay a visit--to promote her book ""What Happened.""\n\nAt the same time, a remarkable number of citizen-activists maintained hope that the state\'s democratic ideals could be restored. I spoke to several of them for a piece I wrote for The New Yorker about the run-up to last week\'s Supreme Court election. Mary Lynne Donohue, a former plaintiff in a landmark lawsuit challenging the state\'s gerrymandering, told me that she co-chaired a grassroots organizing effort that included knocking on thirty-five hundred doors in her home town of Sheboygan. When the election results came in, Donohue, who is seventy-three years old, seemed as excited that Democrats had held seats on the city council and school board as she was about Protasiewicz\'s victory. ""Our local party has been transformed,"" she told me. ""People are finally waking up.""\n\nCourts move slowly, and Protasiewicz won\'t even be seated until August 1st. In the near term, the abortion ban will remain in place. But providers are hopeful. Kristin Lyerly, an ob-gyn who lives in Green Bay, has been commuting to Minnesota to practice. Now she is making plans to open a clinic in Wisconsin. Legal activists have also begun to mobilize. Jeff Mandell, a co-founder of Law Forward, a progressive, nonprofit law firm, is helping to build a new gerrymandering case, which, if successful, may create momentum for similar challenges in other states. (Two days after the election in Wisconsin, the legislature in Tennessee expelled two Black members for protesting gun violence, using super-majorities made possible by partisan gerrymandering.) Progressive lawyers are also discussing challenges to Act 10, the right-to-work law, the voter-I.D. law, and legislation that stripped significant powers from the offices of the governor and the attorney general, which passed during a lame-duck session, in 2018, after Walker lost to a Democrat.\n\nThe election, however, was not a total defeat for the right, which won ballot referendums that gave judges more power over bail and supported work requirements for welfare recipients. More important, Dan Knodl, a Republican, narrowly won a special election to fill a vacancy in the State Senate, giving the G.O.P. a veto-proof super-majority. Just before last week\'s election, Knodl floated the idea that the State Senate could impeach Protasiewicz, for having sentenced too leniently, he said, as a circuit-court judge. After she won, the Senate majority leader dismissed the idea, but the fact that it was raised, coupled with Kelly\'s defiant concession speech, suggests that the state\'s Republican Party is willing to continue rejecting democratic norms.\n\nIt\'s not yet clear that crucial democratic pillars--widespread economic security, a strong labor movement, durable and well-funded public institutions--can be rebuilt. (Since 2010, Wisconsin\'s union membership has declined by half. Today, barely seven per cent of its workforce is unionized.) A Democratic coalition that relies on Republican-leaning suburbanites may prove fragile, especially if Trump disappears and abortion rights are restored. And more than forty-five million dollars, most of it dark money, was spent on Protasiewicz\'s and Kelly\'s campaigns, making this the most expensive judicial race in U.S. history--hardly a sign of a healthy democracy.\n\nIn 1854, Wisconsin\'s Supreme Court ruled that the Fugitive Slave Act, which forced escaped slaves to be returned to their owners, was unconstitutional. It was the only state to do so. Five years later, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that ruling in a decision that helped ignite the Civil War. A generation after that, Wisconsin\'s Supreme Court upheld one of the country\'s first restrictions on laissez-faire capitalism: a law regulating the railroad companies, which were gouging farmers and, along with the timber industry, effectively controlling the state legislature. Edward G. Ryan, the chief justice, wrote that failure to uphold the law, which helped pave the way for government regulation of big industries, would ""establish great corporations as independent powers within the state.""\n\nJustice Ann Walsh Bradley is aware of this lineage; when she joined the court, in 1995, it was, in her mind, still intact. Back then, she told me, ""we were without a doubt consistently considered one of the very top state Supreme Courts in the nation."" She cited the efforts of Shirley Abrahamson, the first woman to serve on the court, who helped pioneer the use of restorative and therapeutic justice, and who launched a program called Justice on Wheels, which took court proceedings on the road, to communities across the state, to make the system more transparent. ""In some ways, I see this election as a continuation of Shirley\'s legacy,"" Bradley told me. ""The burden of responsibility is heavy on my shoulders."" That weight is likely to grow heavier. In 2025, Bradley will have to defend her own seat on the court--and its new liberal majority. For the moment, however, she\'s still savoring the victory. ""Even talking right now with you,"" she said, ""there are chills that go up and down my spine. https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-liberal-victory-in-wisconsin"
"Elliott from ""E.T."" 's College Essay Common Application Supplement\n\nWhen I was ten years old, suburban and average, something happened that changed the course of my life. We were the first house on our street to experience the phenomenon, though to me it felt like we were the first on the planet. That year, my family received a surprise visitor--divorce.\n\nI wish that I had something uniquely harrowing to share--something to demonstrate my will and my ability to face adversity. Unfortunately, I\'ve lived a largely uneventful adolescence. I even took comfort in my family\'s averageness. When my parents first separated, I didn\'t tell anyone at school. Dad moving out was my little secret, something I kept tucked away, metaphorically hidden among my stuffed animals. I didn\'t want my peers to see me differently, but I had never felt so isolated. With the exception of my alien friend, whom I nicknamed E.T., I felt alone in the world.\n\nYou asked about a challenge or a struggle that I had to overcome. Well, I struggled to answer. What could I possibly say that would interest you, the admissions staff of the University of California, Berkeley? Then it dawned on me--the most significant experience of my otherwise unremarkable youth was when my parents\' separation forced me to overcome my fear of being different, and to accept differences in others.\n\nUntil the divorce, I spent my days in Los Angeles\'s San Fernando Valley--shopping at my favorite indoor mall, the Galleria, eating burgers at Mel\'s, and building an unbreakable bond with the celestial stranger who lived in my closet. But suddenly there was a fissure in this idyllic, typical existence. My siblings didn\'t understand. Gertie, my sister, was too young and innocent to recognize the brewing rift, or to fear ostracism by those who had not yet experienced a wrinkle in space-time as significant as the dissipation of our parents\' marriage. And my big brother, Michael, well, he was too tall and well adjusted, too interested in both football and Dungeons & Dragons to notice the gravitational loss associated with familial trauma.\n\nAt ten, one starts to question who they are, why they\'re here, and if humans are alone in the universe. Like E.T., I felt unmoored, lost, wishing I could ""phone home,"" as he\'d often put it. But what is home? I thought that I belonged with my mother and father, but they were splitting into separate entities. Not entities like aliens, per se, but more like humans whose respective lives were expanding infinitely apart. I asked E.T. if this was what space felt like, and his index finger glowed, which meant yes. I was devastated.\n\nI tried to find pleasure in simple things--moonlit bike rides, Reese\'s Pieces, E.T. in a woman\'s hat. Still, my parents\' tumultuous breakup ate away at me. Some kids might say that having two homes is great, but when you\'re on your dad\'s pullout sofa, struggling to fall asleep next to the clammy skin of an interplanetary goblin, and you realize that you forgot your favorite red hoodie at your mom\'s? Not so fun. Sometimes, when it felt like my father was a galaxy away, E.T. would levitate several balls to demonstrate just how far that was. It was hard to process.\n\nIf I focussed on the things happening right in front of me--like my short, spooky pal being dragged away by men who swore that they wouldn\'t hurt him--it only upset me more. And when the government encased our house in a biohazard bubble, I knew it was because of our toxic familial strife. Would things be better if my parents were still a unit? Would the uniformed men with guns and walkie-talkies have been so set on testing the psychic connection between me and E.T. if they\'d thought I belonged to a nuclear family? As the F.B.I. ran a sting operation to capture my opaque brother, I couldn\'t help but wonder: Was the divorce my fault?\n\nObviously, now--as a seventeen-year-old in the nineties, who understands the world--I know that\'s not true. We all have defining moments in our lives. For me, it was my parents\' divorce. For my mom, it was when the neighbors ostracized her because they thought that her home was tainted with alien blood. Disruption was completely foreign to me, but its arrival made me rethink my infatuation with ""normalcy."" Life is not simple, but in its complication we connect.\n\nNow I feel ready for the challenges of university, and of Northern California. I know that college can feel like a culture shock, but spending my high-school years on two different sides of town felt like being shuttled back and forth across outer space. However, just like the U.F.O. that left my friend E.T. behind, one fateful night, life is full of ups and downs. This is why U.C. Berkeley is the perfect school for me. https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/elliott-from-et-s-college-essay"
"Mysterious Dark Matter Mapped In Finest Detail Yet According to the BBC, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in Chile has traced the distribution of dark matter ""on a quarter of the sky and across almost 14 billion years of time."" From the report: In the image [here], the colored areas are the portions of the sky studied by the telescope. Orange regions show where there is more mass, or matter, along the line of sight; purple where there is less. Typical features are hundreds of millions of light-years across. The grey/white areas show where contaminating light from dust in our Milky Way galaxy has obscured a deeper view. The distribution of matter agrees very well with scientific predictions. ACT observations indicate that the ""lumpiness"" of the Universe and the rate at which it has been expanding after 14 billion years of evolution are just what you\'d expect from the standard model of cosmology, which has Einstein\'s theory of gravity (general relativity) at its foundation. Recent measurements that used an alternative background light, one emitted from stars in galaxies rather than the CMB, had suggested the Universe lacked sufficient lumpiness. Another tension concerns the rate at which the Universe is expanding - a number called the Hubble constant. When [the European Space Agency\'s Planck observatory] looked at temperature fluctuations across the CMB, it determined the rate to be about 67 kilometres per second per megaparsec (A megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years). Or put another way - the expansion increases by 67km per second for every 3.26 million light-years we look further out into space. A tension arises because measurements of the expansion in the nearby Universe, made using the recession from us of variable stars, clocks in at about 73km/s per megaparsec. It\'s a difference that can\'t easily be explained. ACT, employing its lensing technique to nail down the expansion rate, outputs a number similar to Planck\'s. ""It\'s very close - about 68km/s per megaparsec,"" said Dr Mathew Madhavacheril from the the University of Pennsylvania. ACT team-member Prof Blake Sherwin from Cambridge University, UK, added: ""We and Planck and several other probes are coming in on the lower side. Obviously, you could have a scenario where both the measurements are right and there\'s some new physics that explains the discrepancy. But we\'re using independent techniques, and I think we\'re now starting to close the loophole where we could all be riding this new physics and one of the measurements has to be wrong."" Papers describing the new results have been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal and posted on the ACT website. https://science.slashdot.org/story/23/04/12/0219257/mysterious-dark-matter-mapped-in-finest-detail-yet"

"Discovery of a hidden Bible chapter written 1,500 years ago is 'fascinating' A 'hidden chapter' of Bible text written more than 1,500 years ago could provide key insights into how the religious text has changed over time, experts say.\n\nThe new text comprises parts of Matthew 11-12 in the New Testament written in the ancient Syriac language, giving more details than today's standard Gospel text.\n\nScientists uncovered the scripture after applying UV light to a manuscript about ancient Christian stories and hymns housed at the Vatican Library.\n\nThe text had been scraped from the parchment, a common practice so new text could be written over it, but the text left traces detectable by UV light.\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline, Dr Garrick Allen, a senior lecturer in New Testament studies at the University of Glasgow, said the discovery provides an insight into the early translations of the Bible.\n\nThe manuscript is chapters 11 through 12 in Matthew. Experts applied UV light to a document, revealing the Bible text was masked behind two layers of writing\n\n'This discovery is highly interesting, but it isn't ground-breaking in isolation, mostly because the newly identified text is only fragmentary parts of Matthew 11-12,' Dr Allen told MailOnline.\n\nOriginal Greek of Matthew chapter 12, verse 1: 'At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath and his disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat.'\n\nSyriac translation: 'At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath and his disciples became hungry began to pick the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat them.'\n\n'The Syriac translation of the Bible is important on its own as one of the earliest translations from Greek.\n\n'It gives us insight into the earliest stages of the text of the Bible and the communities that produced these translations.'\n\nJustin Brierley, a Christian author, broadcaster and radio host, called the discovery 'fascinating'.\n\n'The discovery of this new fragment of a Syriac copy of the Gospels is yet another example of how rich the manuscript tradition of the New Testament has been over many centuries,' he told MailOnline.\n\n'It's also fascinating to note the variation in some of the wording of Matthew's gospel compared to our received version of the text.\n\n'I often encounter critics who question whether the Bible has been changed over time, but the science of textual criticism, aided by discoveries like these, help historians to put together an extremely accurate picture of what the original gospels said.'\n\nProfessor Hugh Houghton at the University of Birmingham's Department of Theology and Religion, called it a 'genuine and important discovery'.\n\n'Until a few years ago we only knew of two manuscript witnesses to the Old Syriac translation of the gospels and now we have four,' he told MailOnline.\n\n'The value of the early translations is that they were made from Greek manuscripts which no longer survive, and may provide some of the first evidence for particular readings.'\n\nProfessor Houghton continued: 'The find is important for Christians as the evidence from this document will be incorporated in editions of the Greek New Testament and used by editors to reconstruct the earliest form of the text.\n\n'Given how few manuscripts survive from the first centuries, all pieces are welcome in reconstructing the jigsaw puzzle of the history of the text.'\n\nThe new text was discovered by Grigory Kessel from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who has not yet revealed a complete translation written in ancient Syriac but shared some details.\n\nIn the Greek version of Matthew chapter 12, verse one reads: 'At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath and his disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat.\n\nThe more detailed Syriac translation reads, '[...] began to pick the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat them.'\n\nAustrian Academy of Sciences scientists found the manuscript in the Vatican Library (pictured). The document was written on parchment that was reused three times. This was a common practice because paper made from animal skin was scarce\n\nThe initial text was written around the third century but was erased by a scribe – a person employed before printing was invented to make copies of documents – in Palestine.\n\nThis was a common practice because the paper made from animal skin was scarce and needed to be reused.\n\nWriting over scrapped off text creates palimpsests – manuscripts with multiple layers of writing.\n\nIts writing style suggests its creator was an early 10th-century scribe in Egypt or the Levant\n\nUV light has become popular among scientists who hope to uncover secret documents, as the hidden text absorbs the light and glows blue.\n\nIt can capture hidden text because parchment soaks in ink. And no matter how often it is reused, the original writings are still imprinted on the paper.\n\n'The Gospel text is hidden in the sense that the early 6th c. parchment copy of the Gospels Book was reused twice and today on the same page one can find three layers of writing (Syriac - Greek - Georgian),' Grigory Kessel from the Austrian Academy of Sciences who made the discovery told MailOnline.\n\nThe Old Syriac translation of the scriptures was called 'Peshitta' and became the official translation used by the Syriac Church in the fifth century.\n\nKessel and his colleagues said the parchment was first reused for the Apophthegmata patrum in Greek, translated to 'Sayings of the Desert Fathers' – a title that refers to early Christian hermits who practiced asceticism in the Egyptian desert.\n\nThey did so around the 3rd century and eventually formed the basis of Christian monasticism.\n\nThe Apophthegmata patrum is a collection of more than 1,000 of their stories and sayings and dates to the late fifth and early sixth centuries.\n\nThe hidden Bible chapter was uncovered by a so-called palimpsest Grigory Kessel from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (pictured)\n\nThe next time the page was erased and reused was to copy the Iadgari of Mikael Modrekili, a Georgian manuscript of the 10th century that included a collection of hymns.\n\nThe Syriac translation was written at least a century before the oldest Greek manuscripts that have survived, including the Codex Sinaiticus – the fourth-century Christian manuscript of the Greek Bible.\n\nClaudia Rapp, Director of the Institute for Medieval Research at the OeAW, said: 'Grigory Kessel has made a great discovery thanks to his profound knowledge of old Syriac texts and script characteristics.'\n\n'This discovery proves how productive and important the interplay between modern digital technologies and basic research can be when dealing with medieval manuscripts.'\n\nThe findings are published in the journal New Testament Studies.\n\nA Utah school district is considering banning students from reading the Bible after a complaint was made about the holy book containing 'inappropriate and pornographic' content.\n\nSchools across the state are using a conservative Utah law passed in 2022 to challenge dozens of books that parents, students, teachers and board members might find offensive.\n\nA complaint was made on December 11 about the religious text, which is just one of 81 books Davis School District is considering removing.\n\nWhile it is not clear exactly which passages the complainant flagged up, there are several mentions of violence throughout the Holy Bible. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11963791/Discovery-hidden-Bible-chapter-written-1-500-years-ago-fascinating.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"Biden unveils toughest-ever car emissions rules in bid to force electric vehicle purchases Jason Hayes, Michigan\'s Mackinac Center\'s director of energy and environmental policy, says EV batteries cannot be repaired, leading to higher insurance premiums.\n\nThe Biden administration unveiled the most aggressive tailpipe emissions ever crafted as part of its sweeping climate agenda and efforts to push Americans to buy electric vehicles (EV).\n\nThe vehicle pollution standards, proposed Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and announced by the White House, will impact car model years 2027 through 2032. The White House said the regulations would ""protect public health"" by achieving carbon emission reductions of nearly 10 billion tons by 2055 and would save consumers an average of $12,000 over the lifetime of vehicles.\n\n""Cars and truck manufacturers have made clear that the future of transportation is electric,"" the White House stated in a fact sheet. ""The market is moving.""\n\n""As a car enthusiast and self-proclaimed car guy, President Biden is seizing the moment,"" it continued.

Critics have argued tougher tailpipe emissions standards for traditional gas-powered cars mainly serve to increase prices to ensure they are cost competitive with expensive electric alternatives.\n\nOverall, if the regulations are finalized, a staggering 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases could be electric by 2032, the White House projected. In addition, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck, 35% of short-haul freight tractor and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could be electric by then.\n\nJOE MANCHIN BLASTS BIDEN ADMIN FOR CEDING CONTROL TO CCP ON GREEN ENERGY: \'PATHETIC\'\n\nBiden previously set a goal of ensuring 50% of car purchases are electric by 2030.

""There is still a market that allows drivers to buy the vehicles of their choice, but government coercion is rapidly limiting those choices.""\n\n""If Biden policies are successful, we will soon have a choice between buying an EV and not being able to afford a vehicle at all,"" Ebell added.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator said Wednesday the aggressive standards are ""readily achievable thanks to President Biden\'s Investing in America agenda.""

And EVs remain far more expensive and less efficient than alternatives.\n\nOverall, the average cost of an EV was $64,338 while the average cost of a compact gas-powered car was $26,101 as of last year, according to Kelley Blue Book. In addition, the Department of Energy reported that the average range of model year 2021 gasoline vehicles was 403 miles compared to the median 234-mile range of model year 2021 EVs.\n\nAnd Republican lawmakers also blasted the rule after it was first reported by various news outlets last week.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n""Yet another draconian rule from the Biden Admin,"" Rep.

"Trinidad: Trinity Exploration reports fire on the Bravo Platform in the Trintes Field, offshore east coast Trinidad. Trinity Exploration & Production, the independent E&P company focused on Trinidad and Tobago, has confirmed that at approximately 21:15 local time on Monday 10 April a generator-related fire occurred on Trinity's Bravo Platform in the Trintes Field, offshore east coast Trinidad.\n\nProduction from the Bravo platform was halted, the fire was then successfully and quickly extinguished and the platform subsequently evacuated. As a precautionary measure, production from the other Trintes platforms, Delta and Alpha, was also shut down.\n\nFour operators were onboard Trintes Bravo at the time of the incident with two sustaining minor burns and all four impacted due to smoke inhalation. All four operators received medical treatment for minor injuries and continue to be monitored.\n\nNo hydrocarbons were released into the environment as a result of this incident.\n\nOn Tuesday, 11 April, a multi-disciplinary team was mobilised to the Bravo platform to comprehensively assess the exact cause and extent of damage arising from the incident and the remediation required to return the facility to service. The damage is limited to a generator with the platform structure and other platform electricals and equipment in good order. The Company estimates replacement of the generator and associated repairs on the Bravo platform will be completed within three to four days and will initiate production restart in a phased manner once approval is received from the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries.\n\nAlpha and Delta crews also conducted precautionary checks ahead of restarting oil production which commenced late evening on Tuesday 11 April 2023, with all previously producing wells coming back online overnight.

"Property sales return to pre-pandemic levels amid greater interest in flats says Rightmove The number of home sales agreed is back to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September, just before the mini-Budget.\n\nNew research by Rightmove found agreed sales numbers are now only 1 per cent behind the levels seen in March 2019.\n\nRightmove defined 'sales agreed' as a home listed for sale on its website that has found a buyer and been marked 'sold subject to contract' by the estate agent.\n\nHowever, the final sold price between a seller and buyer can sometimes be different from the final listing price on Rightmove, which is recorded on Land Registry several months later.\n\nThe number of property sales agreed is 1 per cent behind the levels seen in March 2019, according to Rightmove\n\nRightmove attributed the rise in agreed sales to a rise in the number of agreed sales on flats, where levels are now 10 per cent above 2019 after being 11 per cent down at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe trend is the most pronounced in London, where agreed sales of flats are now 23 per cent higher than in March 2019.\n\nThe total number of sales agreed has recovered from being 21 per cent behind 2019's levels in January.\n\nOverall, sales agreed have recovered the most in London and are now 11 per cent higher than March 2019, while sales agreed in the East Midlands are taking longest to catch up and are still 11 per cent below 2019.\n\nAcross Britain, agreed sales are 18 per cent below the red-hot property market of this time last year.\n\nAverage mortgage rates have been edging down this year. The average mortgage rate for a five-year fix, with a 15 per cent deposit mortgage, was 4.63 per cent in March, down from 5.89 per cent in October, according to Rightmove data sourced from Podium Solutions.\n\nRightmove has revealed the level of sales agreed across different regions in Britain\n\nThe average price reduction has increased and is now back to its pre-pandemic level of 6 per cent, the equivalent of £22,000, based on the current national average asking price. This is up from 5 per cent during the pandemic.\n\nA third of properties now see a price reduction, which is up from last year's 19 per cent during the frenetic market, but in line with the pre-pandemic level of 34 per cent.\n\nHowever, the final sold price between a seller and buyer can sometimes be different from the final listing price on Rightmove, and is only recorded on the Land Registry several months later.\n\nTim Bannister, of Rightmove, said: 'The market is remaining surprisingly robust given the economic headwinds that have affected movers in the last six months.\n\n'While the market is by no means at the exceptional level it has been in the last couple of years, it is a positive sign for agents that sales at a national level are being agreed at the same rate as the last more normal market of 2019, though there are regional differences across Britain.\n\n'The level and size of reductions has also returned to its pre-pandemic norm, though pricing right the first time can often lead to a quicker sale, so it's important for sellers to speak to an agent about their local market so that they price realistically and give themselves the best chance of finding a buyer.'\n\nThe average price reduction has increased, says Rightmove, bringing joy to many homebuyers\n\nRightmove has revealed a 2 per cent increase in the average asking price of a flat from 2022 to 2023, and a 10 per cent jump from 2019 to march 2023.\n\nIts findings are based on the average asking prices of listings on Rightmove, rather than the final sold prices which appear in Land Registry some months later.\n\n• Average asking price of a flat in March 2023 - £291,985\n\n• Average asking price of a flat in March 2022 - £285,596\n\n• Average asking price of a flat in March 2019 - £265,757\n\nRobert Sturges, of estate agents Chestertons, said: 'We have a high proportion of flats for sale and we have noticed a significant upswing in buyer demand for apartments of all sizes.\n\n'This demand for flats is driven by professionals who wish to shorten their commute, parents who invest for their children but also overseas buyers who are taking advantage of favourable currency exchange rates.\n\n'In the face of rising living costs, some buyers may also decide that a flat is financially more viable than a house at this moment in time.\n\n'Another driving force behind the demand for flats are renters who review their finances amid rising rents and decide that, despite higher mortgage rates, buying presents a better option long-term. We are therefore seeing a number of first-time buyers entering the market. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-11960333/Property-sales-return-pre-pandemic-levels-amid-greater-flats-says-Rightmove.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"What Good Are Wearable Computers if the Data Is Wrong? Smartwatches from tech companies like Apple and Garmin make it easy to see a number that could reflect how old you are more accurately than your age: the VO2max, the maximum amount of oxygen that your body can use during intense exercise.\n\nThe higher your VO2max, exercise experts say, the better your cardiovascular fitness and, potentially, the longer your life. In the past, only serious athletes sought a traditional VO2max test, which involved wearing cumbersome sensors while exercising inside a lab, but now anyone can get an estimate by wearing a smartwatch and moving around.\n\nIs it good to have access to this kind of information? And how accurate could a wearable be? In the last five months, when I fell down a VO2max rabbit hole, I learned some uncomfortable truths about my health and the limits of smartwatches.\n\nFirst, let me tell you about my fitness journey. In November, while I was out celebrating my birthday, my Apple Watch delivered the most unwanted gift: a notification of a high heart rate. That led me to look at my VO2max, which the Apple Watch said was 32, well below average for a man in his late 30s. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/technology/personaltech/vo2max-smartwatches-fitness-accuracy.html"
"Nuclear forensics course Videos are presenting determination of uranium isotope ratios by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) in swipe samples. Swipe samples are often taken in the case when we want to investigate non-disclosed presence of nuclear material. Information on U isotope ratios can reveal presence of enriched or depleted uranium, as well as presence of U-236. Determination of U isotope ratios by MC-ICP-MS is time consuming and involve destruction of the sample. This is the reason why such analysis is normally applied in later stages of nuclear forensics investigation, following faster and non-destructive techniques. In addition, it require different skills, starting from selection of suitable sample preparation method, radionuclide separation techniques, usage of sophisticated measurement equipment and data analysis. The aim of the videos is to present these skills through step by step analytical procedure. http://videolectures.net/nuclear-forensics_course/"
"Elon Musk admitted he should probably stop tweeting at 3:00 a.m.: 'Have I shot myself in the foot with tweets multiple times? Yes' Elon Musk has opened up about his erratic tweeting style saying he\'s shot himself in the foot with posts on the site in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday.\n\nThe billionaire owner of Twitter sat down for a last minute candid interview with BBC correspondent James Clayton at Twitter\'s headquarters, in which he opened up about his takeover of Twitter, laying off employees, working habits and more.\n\nSpeaking about his posting habits on the platform he now owns, Musk said: ""Have I shot myself in the foot multiple times?

"After Texas Ruling, Democratic States Move to Stockpile Abortion Pills Some in favor of abortion rights worry that moves to stock up on misoprostol in lieu of mifepristone is a hedge that could have unintended consequences. Mary Ziegler, a law professor and historian of abortion at the University of California, Davis, said such decisions might unintentionally signal that the mifepristone should not be used in medication abortions.\n\n""I think they\'re looking at this and thinking, \'I don\'t know who is going to be in the White House in 2024, we can\'t rely on the F.D.A.\',"" she said of states considering the option. ""It\'s premature to do that and it might frighten people unnecessarily. We\'re in a climate where a lot of people don\'t know what the law is.""\n\nThe legal confusion has also made some states hesitate in making concrete plans, though some Democratic leaders said they expected more states to focus on securing access to pills.\n\n""I am confident, too, in speaking with other governors around the country, that you will see more and more states step up,"" said Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts at a news conference on Monday, with Senator Elizabeth Warren and others by her side. ""The battle to ban abortions has been fought in the states. The battle to win reproductive freedom and women\'s right to an abortion will be won in the states, and that\'s what you see happening here.""\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Healey said that the state had been discussing, for several weeks, how to structure a purchase order and who the appropriate purchasing agent would be. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/us/democratic-states-abortion-pills.html"
"Is Punishing Innocent People Unconstitutional? Last December, Christopher Dunn asked the United States Supreme Court to order his release from prison or at least grant him a new trial. He is serving a life sentence in Missouri for a crime he did not commit, and he is hoping the court will agree to take up his case this spring.\n\nDunn contends that the U.S. Constitution forbids punishing innocent people and is asking the justices to declare that it is unconstitutional for a state to keep an innocent man in prison. A court in Missouri now agrees that he is not guilty. But Dunn is caught up in a nightmarish legal thicket. It is time for the Supreme Court to end his nightmare and say that this country will not tolerate punishing the innocent.\n\nDunn was convicted and sentenced to life in prison plus 90 years for the 1990 slaying of Recco Rodgers, a teenager who was shot while visiting a friend in in the Wells-Goodfellow neighborhood of St. Louis. According to a report in the New Republic, ""(T)he sound of gunfire was common in Wells-Goodfellow. Hearing the shots that killed Rogers, some neighbors did not bother even to look outside.""\n\nAt the time Rodgers was killed, Dunn was 18 years old. He was at home talking with a friend on the phone while his family was in another room watching television.\n\nAs the New Republic notes, Dunn had recently completed ""a brief prison sentence for cocaine possession and receiving stolen property"" and previously had served time in juvenile detention on other charges. As a result, he was well-known by the police who patrolled in the Wells-Goodfellow neighborhood.\n\nDunn was arrested after two boys--DeMorris Stepp, who was 14 years old, and Michael Davis, who was 12--told police that they had been hanging out with Rodgers when they saw someone firing a gun from an adjacent yard. They both said that it was Dunn. They agreed to testify against him after the prosecution offered them a deal.\n\nSuch inducements are common in the prosecution of serious criminal cases. Dunn\'s is one of countless instances in which someone involved in a crime gets off with a lighter sentence after pinning the blame on someone else.\n\nAnd, as is often the case for poor people in this country, Dunn did not get very good legal representation. His overworked public defender spent only 15 minutes with him prior to trial and did not want to invest much time on his case. It did not seem to matter that, right from the start, Dunn had insisted that he was innocent and had witnesses who would support his alibi.\n\nDunn\'s lawyer interviewed only two potential witnesses and told Dunn that she couldn\'t find other people on his list of witnesses. She urged him to plead guilty to second-degree murder. Dunn refused.\n\nHis trial was over in only half a day. The prosecution offered no motive for the crime and presented no physical evidence linking Dunn to Rodgers\' death. His case rested almost entirely on the testimony of Stepp and Davis. It took less than an hour for the jury to return a guilty verdict.\n\nBut Dunn\'s case was more than the story of yet another young Black person caught up in a cycle of crime and violence.\n\nIn 2005 things began to unravel when Stepp admitted he had perjured himself in testimony against Dunn. He said he had been pressured by police and prosecutors to say that Dunn was the killer. In 2015 Davis also recanted his testimony and said that he actually could not see the person who shot Rodgers.\n\nSometime later another man who had witnessed the shooting of Rodgers said that it was too dark for anyone to see who killed him.\n\nIn 2020, Missouri Circuit Court Judge William Hickle reviewed the Dunn case and concluded that Dunn was ""actually innocent."" As he put it, based on the new evidence, ""no jury would now convict Christopher Dunn […] (since) any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt.""\n\nSo why hasn\'t he been set free?\n\nUnder a bizarre interpretation of Missouri law, only people who are sentenced to death can bring actual innocence claims in the state\'s courts. As a Missouri Court of Appeals said in 2016, ""Because the Missouri Supreme Court has not yet recognized a freestanding claim of actual innocence in cases where the death penalty has not been imposed, or based even in death penalty cases on principles of due process, we are not at liberty to expand Missouri habeas jurisprudence to permit consideration of the claim in this non-death penalty case.""\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate, this means that Dunn would be free today, if only he had been sentenced to death.\n\nAnd here is where the U.S. Supreme Court comes in.\n\nThirty years ago in a case called Herrera v. Collins, a 6–3 majority concluded that evidence of actual innocence was ""not relevant"" in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus ""absent some constitutional violation."" As Chief Justice William Rehnquist put it, ""Due process does not require that every conceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent person […] To conclude otherwise would all but paralyze our system for enforcement of the criminal law.""\n\nAnd, after reviewing the history of the Constitution\'s due process clause, Rehnquist concluded, that a claim of "" \'actual innocence\' is not itself a constitutional claim.""\n\nSince Herrera was decided, courts all over the country have cited it as a reason to deny relief to people like Dunn. And, in 2022, the court seemed to reaffirm Herrera and again ruled that appellate courts do not have to consider actual innocence claims.\n\nBut a lot has happened that should now lead the Supreme Court to revisit Herrera, including most importantly, the mountain of evidence that numerous people have been, and are being, convicted and sentenced for crimes they did not commit.\n\nIn 2009, Justice John Paul Stevens recognized those facts and used a concurrence in another actual innocence case to observe that any statute that ""bars relief for a death row inmate who has established his innocence"" is ""arguably unconstitutional."" He argued that ""decisions of this Court clearly support the proposition that it would be an atrocious violation of our Constitution and the principles upon which it is based to execute an innocent person.""\n\nStevens asked the court to ""imagine a petitioner […] who possesses new evidence conclusively and definitively proving, beyond any scintilla of doubt, that he is an innocent man."" He criticized Herrera\'s reasoning, saying it ""would allow such a petitioner to be put to death nonetheless. The Court correctly refuses to endorse such reasoning.""\n\nThe Dunn case offers the court a chance to apply that simple and straightforward conclusion to all punishments, including life in prison and the death penalty.\n\nWhatever the Supreme Court decides, it is time for Missouri to own up to its mistake. The St. Louis County District Attorney should initiate the kind of process that, in 2021, led to the release of Kevin Strickland in 2021, 43 years after he was sent to prison for a murder he did not commit.\n\nWhether by a Supreme Court decision or a procedure in Missouri, Christopher Dunn deserves to be a free man. As Judge Learned Hand noted 100 years ago, ""Our procedure has been always haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted. It is an unreal dream."" But that dream has been all too real for Dunn and others like him. Every American has a stake in burying the ghost that Hand references once and for all. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/04/supreme-court-case-dunn-innocent-missouri-constitution.html?via=rss"
"Brace for stock-market volatility to persist this year as investors get bombarded with economic data, UBS says It\'s going to remain tricky for investors to pick stocks for the rest of this year because markets are still hooked on unpredictable economic data, according to UBS.\n\nThe Swiss bank\'s CIO Mark Haefele expects the choppiness stocks seen in the early months of 2023 to continue, thanks to traders\' fixation on the rate of inflation and unemployment.\n\n""So far, 2023 has been a much better year for asset class returns, with the S&P 500 up 7.5% year-to-date, but has been characterized by ever-changing market narratives,"" Haefele wrote in a note Wednesday.\n\nThe investment chief was referring to the benchmark US stock index\'s rebound this year from a plunge of 18% in 2022.\n\n""The potential remains for this data-dependent market to keep jumping from one narrative to another for the rest of the year,"" he added. ""This should make it difficult for investors to navigate the coming months.""\n\nThe note comes ahead of the release later Wednesday of the monthly Consumer Price Index report, which will show how much US inflation rose in March. His bank believes the CPI will come in at 5.1% -- down from 6% in February, but still far off the Federal Reserve\'s 2% target.\n\nMarkets will stay unpredictable even if inflation cools for a ninth month in a row, according to Haefele, because investors are still struggling to make sense of the US labor market.\n\nFriday\'s nonfarm payrolls report showed the US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, its lowest print since December 2020. Investors are divided on whether that\'s good or bad news.\n\n""While the optimistic interpretation of this data is that the tightness in the labor market is easing as the balance of supply and demand of labor improves, the pessimists view it as the first cracks that could be followed by much greater deterioration in the coming months,"" Haefele said.\n\nWorries about an economic slowdown could soon replace inflation tracking as a key focus, UBS\'s investment chief added.\n\nEconomists have warned that the Fed\'s year of aggressive interest-rate hikes will likely soon start weighing on growth – and that slowdown could drag on stocks by chipping away at listed companies\' earnings.\n\n""As inflation eases, growth may take over as the more dominant concern, perceived or otherwise,"" Haefele said.\n\n""The optics of a decline in headline CPI to 3% may reinforce the view that growth, rather than inflation, will be driving Fed decisions and the market\'s performance,"" he added.\n\nRead more: It\'s time for the Fed to pause its war on inflation before it starts dragging down the US economy, top Moody\'s economist says https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-inflation-economic-data-unemployment-ubs-mark-haefele-2023-4"

"China Could Dominate Sodium Batteries, the Next Big Advance in Power Electricity in one large Chinese province, Shandong, already sells for up to 20 times more in early evening, when demand is high, than at mid-day, when the grid is flooded with more solar power than factories and homes need. The power generation companies use lithium batteries to distribute their renewable electricity across more hours.\n\nBut some utilities, like Three Gorges Corporation in west-central China, are beginning to experiment with sodium batteries.

"OpenAI starts bug bounty program with cash rewards up to $20,000 Microsoft-backed OpenAI has launched a bug bounty program and is inviting the global community of security researchers, ethical hackers, and technology enthusiasts to help the company identify and address vulnerabilities in its artificial intelligent systems.\n\n""We are excited to build on our coordinated disclosure commitments by offering incentives for qualifying vulnerability information,"" OpenAI said in its blog post on Tuesday.\n\nBased on the severity and impact of the reported vulnerability, OpenAI will hand out cash rewards ranging from $200 for low-severity findings to up to $20,000 for exceptional discoveries.\n\nThe company has partnered with Bugcrowd, a bug bounty platform, to manage the submission and reward process.\n\nThe OpenAI bug bounty program includes API targets, ChatGPT, third-party corporate targets, OpenAI API keys, and OpenAI research organization.\n\nThe API targets include OpenAI API and public cloud resources or infrastructure involved in serving the OpenAI API such as cloud storage accounts (e.g., Azure data blobs), and cloud compute servers (e.g., Azure virtual machines).\n\nIn terms of ChatGPT, the scope includes ChatGPT Plus, logins, subscriptions, OpenAI-created plugins (e.g. browsing, code interpreter), plugins a user creates themselves, and all other functionality.\n\nIncluded in the scope of the program is confidential OpenAI corporate information that may be exposed through third parties such as Google Workspace, Asana, Trello, Jira, Monday.com, Notion, Confluence, Evernote, Intercom, Hubspot, Zendesk, Salesforce, Stripe, Airbase, Navan, Tableau, Mode, Charthop, and Looker, Bugcrowd said.\n\nIssues related to the content of model prompts and responses are strictly out of scope, and will not be rewarded unless they have an additional directly verifiable security impact on an in-scope service. Even model hallucinations are listed as out of scope by OpenAI.\n\n""Model safety issues do not fit well within a bug bounty program, as they are not individual, discrete bugs that can be directly fixed,"" OpenAI said.\n\nExamples of issues that are out of scope include jailbreaks or safety bypasses, getting the model to say bad things, getting the model to tell you how to do bad things, and getting the model to write malicious code.\n\nModel hallucinations refer to situations where the user gets the model to pretend to do bad things, get the model to pretend to give you answers to secrets, and get the model to pretend to be a computer and execute code are also considered out of the scope of the bug bounty program.\n\nOnce a vulnerability is discovered, information related to it needs to be communicated using OpenAI\'s Bugcrowd program. The details of the vulnerability need to be kept confidential until authorized for release by OpenAI\'s security team. OpenAI said it aims to provide authorization within 90 days of report receipt.\n\nThe announcement of the bug bounty program by the company comes within weeks of ChatGPT facing a security incident. Last month, the company revealed a Redis client open source library bug had led to ChatGPT outage and data leak, where users could see other users\' personal information and chat queries.\n\nChat queries and personal information such as subscriber names, email addresses, payment addresses, and partial credit card information of approximately 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers were exposed, the company acknowledged.\n\nChatGPT was launched by OpenAI in November and had over 1 million users within the first five days.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT is increasingly facing competition. On Monday, Alibaba Cloud announced the launch of a new large language model, called Tongyi Qianwen, which it will roll out as a ChatGPT-style front end to all its business applications.\n\nTongyi Qianwen will support both English and Chinese inputs and rolled out in beta test for customers in China.\n\nAnother Chinese internet services and AI giant, Baidu, announced a Chinese language ChatGPT alternative, Ernie bot last month. In its initial phase, 650 business partners would have access to the bot, and the company hopes to improve the bot based on feedback. https://www.csoonline.com/article/3693019/openai-starts-bug-bounty-program-with-cash-rewards-up-to-20-000.html#tk.rss_news"
"Wildfire in Central New Jersey Forces Evacuations A quick-moving wildfire in central New Jersey prompted a wave of evacuations and road closures on Tuesday night, as crews scrambled to get the flames under control, the authorities said.\n\nThe blaze, called the Jimmy's Waterhole fire, had burned 2,500 acres of federal, state and private property in Manchester Township, in Ocean County, about 50 miles east of Philadelphia, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said early Wednesday.\n\nManchester Township has a population of about 45,000, according to the latest census data.\n\nOfficials said 170 structures had been evacuated and 75 others were threatened by early Wednesday, when the fire was about 10 percent contained. The authorities also closed portions of Route 539 and Route 70, which runs from Philadelphia east toward the coast.\n\nThe Forest Fire Service first alerted the public about the blaze on Tuesday night.

"Elon Musk says he's cut about 80% of Twitter's staff Elon Musk has laid off more than 6,000 people at Twitter since taking over the company, he told the BBC in a rare interview late Tuesday.\n\nMusk was quoted as saying in the interview that the social media platform now has only 1,500 employees, down from under 8,000 who were employed at the time of his acquisition. The reduction equates to roughly 80% of the company\'s staff.\n\nIt\'s ""not fun at all"" and can sometimes be ""painful,"" the billionaire CEO told the British broadcaster at Twitter\'s head office in San Francisco.\n\nThe world\'s second richest man said that ""drastic action"" was needed when he came on board, because the company was facing ""a $3 billion negative cash flow situation.""

    What To Comment If Someone Posts About A Loss Or Death

 Every now and then as I scroll through Instagram or Facebook, I come across a sad type of post ― a friend or acquaintance sharing the news of a loved one\'s death. Just this weekend, a former college classmate announced the passing of her mother after a long experience with cancer. Last month, it was a family friend\'s father who died unexpectedly in an accident.\n\nIn these moments, I want to show my support and send love to the grieving person and others affected by this loss, but I quickly start doubting every word I type as I try to share a message in the comments.\n\n""It is really hard to say something \'perfectly\' in person to someone who has suffered a loss, let alone write something to express your condolences,"" Dr. Jessica Gold, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, told HuffPost. ""I am trained in psychiatry, and when I come across these posts, I still question what to say and if I said it correctly. It\'s OK to take your time and reflect on what to post, and not post immediately when you see something. It is better to be thoughtful than first.""\n\nAlthough there\'s no perfect combination of words to share in this situation, there are some good guidelines to keep in mind. Below, Gold and other experts share their advice for responding in the comments section to a death announcement or other post about loss.\n\n""Check your relationship and your motivation before commenting,"" said Megan Devine, a psychotherapist and author of ""It\'s OK That You\'re Not OK."" ""How close am I to this person? What does this relationship call for? If you\'re close friends, a direct message or text might be better. If you\'re casual acquaintances or \'social media friends,\' keep your response simple. If it\'s a celebrity or other public figure, a simple \'we love you\' or similar is fine.""\n\nAsk yourself who your comment is for ― yourself or the person receiving it.\n\n""Are you commenting to make yourself feel like you did something and feel better or because you know the person well, and genuinely want to express your care for them?"" Gold said. ""The reason for posting is important. You don\'t need to respond to every memorial you come across. Consider your relationship with the individual and the deceased.""\n\nIf you\'re close to the person, remember there are other ways to acknowledge what they shared and connect with them outside of social media comments.\n\n""Ask, \'Do I want others to see that I\'m being supportive?\'"" Devine said. ""Am I tempted to leave a long, thoughtful comment so that others see how Great I Am At Supporting? That\'s not the best reason to comment. Performative support isn\'t really support.""\n\n""Avoid all the standard cliches and platitudes,"" Devine said. ""Things like \'Everything happens for a reason,\' \'They\'re in a better place,\' \'You\'re stronger than you think,\' \'They wouldn\'t want you to be sad,\' or any statement that starts with \'At least ... \' No one likes to be talked out of their pain ― and that\'s what these statements do.""\n\nThe statement ""they\'re in a better place"" can be particularly tough.\n\n""This makes assumptions about how people perceive things like the afterlife, and their loved ones and their loss,"" Gold said. ""It also can feel offensive ― \'Death is better than being with me/us?\'""\n\n""Being genuine, sincere and even brief is OK,"" said Dan Reidenberg, executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education. ""Just say something that is kind. Always think to yourself before you write your comment: \'What would I want to see if this were me?\'""\n\nHe recommended something simple like ""I am thinking about you and your family during this really difficult time."" If you didn\'t know the person who died, don\'t act like you did.\n\n""I think it\'s important to respond with a genuine expression of sympathy when you choose to comment,"" echoed Diane Brennan, a grief counselor at Life & Loss Mental Health Counseling. ""If you knew the person who died, you can offer a comment to share a memory or remembrance about them, you can comment about how you will miss them or miss something specific about them. If you did not know the person, I would stick to offerings of condolence to acknowledge their loss and the pain they are experiencing in this moment.""\n\nGold recommended showing support without making assumptions about how someone feels.\n\n""I prefer something like \'I can only imagine what you are going through\' instead of \'it must be really hard for you,\'"" she said. ""I often express my desire for them to have space to feel and heal and to do whatever they need: \'I hope you have time and space to do whatever it is you need in this time.\'""\n\nIf someone had a long, painful illness, avoid statements like ""at least they are free from pain now,"" ""now you can move on with your life"" or ""at least you had a chance to say goodbye.""\n\n""That makes assumptions that their death eliminates a burden or that saying goodbye and preparing for death was a consolation,"" Gold said. ""Even expected deaths are still deaths and have emotional reactions to them.""\n\nShe added that if you\'re stuck on what to write, you can even be honest in saying something like, ""It\'s hard to find the right words ― or there are no right words ― to express support in moments like this, but know I\'m here and thinking of you.""\n\n""Share a memory of the person, if that seems appropriate,"" Devine advised. ""For example, \'Your mom was always at your soccer games. I remember how happy she was to be there.\'""\n\nIf you have lots of memories or a longer story to share, consider sending that directly to the bereaved in a personal message, email or card for posterity. Explain how the person they lost impacted your life.\n\n""Happy memories and ways someone supported you can be uplifting in times that can feel sad,"" Gold said.\n\n""It is not the time for comparing grief,"" Gold said. ""Avoid focusing on your own grief about the person\'s death. It is not about you.""\n\nShe also recommended avoiding comments like, ""When my so-and-so died, I ... "" in this context. This is about their experience, not your similar situation.\n\n""Avoid hijacking their post with your own stories of loss, illness, etc.,"" Devine said. ""Keep the focus on them, or share a memory of their person. If they\'re sharing that they\'re ill, or someone close to them is ill, avoid offering advice ― \'Have they tried green juice?\' ― or your experience with the illness ―\'My dad had that and he\'s fine now!\'""\n\nSimilarly, Gold advised against saying ""I know how you are feeling.""\n\n""Grief and loss is a deeply personal experience and everyone\'s loss is unique,"" she said. ""And avoid \'I don\'t know what I would do if my husband/spouse/friend died.\' It does not comfort the person, it makes them feel isolated in their experience.""\n\n""The biggest thing to remember is that most people don\'t want to be cheered up, they want to feel heard,"" Devine said. ""That\'s a very normal human impulse to make people feel better ― and a tendency for people to give unsolicited advice. Just not telling people to look on the bright side puts you way ahead of most messages and comments of support. Just not flooding them with advice makes you a more skilled supporter than the average commenter.""\n\nShe shared an animation she made that breaks down the problem with trying to cheer up a grieving person and shares better ways to offer support. Unless the person specifically asked to be cheered up, that\'s probably not what they want, so save your funny cat videos for another time. Acknowledging their grief and sitting with them in their pain are more helpful.\n\n""Don\'t make assumptions about timelines for grief,"" Gold added. ""Don\'t say, \'I hope you feel better soon\' or \'It gets better every day\' as there is no timeline for grief, so don\'t pressure them to feel like they are OK faster.""\n\n""Avoid asking for personal details in a social media post,"" Devine said. ""One, if they haven\'t shared personal information, there\'s probably a reason. Two, if you\'re close, you probably already know the details.""\n\nShut down any speculation you may see about how the person died. It\'s particularly crucial to be mindful in situations that may have involved suicide.\n\n""It is important to avoid perpetuating myths and misconceptions about suicide,"" Reidenberg said. ""Don\'t speculate about what might have been happening around the death, and absolutely do not repeat rumors or even factual information such as a method or location of a suicide. The other best practices would be to avoid talking about the person who died as a \'hero.\' These will help reduce the risk of suicide contagion.""\n\n""Don\'t say \'I\'m here if you need anything,\'"" Devine said. ""Not because they don\'t need things, but because identifying a need, figuring out who might fill that need, and then reaching out to ask is light years beyond their energy levels, capacity or interest. If you\'re close friends or not close, but want to help, make tangible, concrete offers of support ― things that lessen the burden of everyday life are helpful, for example: walking the dog, picking up groceries or helping with other tasks.""\n\nShe suggested contributing to their GoFundMe or a similar account if such an option exists. Ask if there\'s an organization you might make a donation to in their memory. Don\'t start a crowdfunding account without their permission if there isn\'t one, however.\n\n""Lead with your willingness to support them and be there for them as needed,"" Gold said. ""For example, \'I am here if you need anything and will text to check in next week to see if you need food.\'""\n\nDevine shared a list of long-distance grief support tips for those who don\'t live near the bereaved person. Sending care packages or little gifts is one option.\n\n""Be specific in your offers of help, and be reliable ― only offer things you will actually do,"" she said.\n\nWhen a close friend or relative experiences a loss, your social media comment is far less important than all of the other ways you can and should show up for them. Focus on the IRL actions you can take, whether it\'s attending the funeral, sending flowers, visiting their house or helping out with logistics.\n\n""Maybe send a text message or contact them by phone a few days or weeks after you saw the post to check in on them,"" Brennan said. ""You can also send a personal note or condolence card as well. Many times people post to social media because they feel it\'s the quickest or easiest way to get the word out, but you don\'t have to offer your condolences via social media. Taking the time to personalize and reach out to someone who is grieving is the best way to offer support. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-to-write-grief-social-media_l_64190b0ae4b0fef15245c726"
"The Most Shocking Thing About This American Reporter's Arrest in Russia Evan Gershkovich, the 31-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter arrested by Russian authorities on charges of espionage, has been declared ""wrongfully detained"" by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, suggesting that U.S. officials hope he might be traded, like a hostage, for some Russian prisoner.\n\n""Journalism is not a crime,"" a State Department spokesman said of the young reporter\'s arrest.\n\nThe problem is, in Vladimir Putin\'s Russia, it often is a crime. In declaring Gershkovich a foreign spy, Putin may have been looking not for a token in a prisoner-exchange, but for an example to deter other reporters--foreign and domestic--from doing their jobs.\n\nGershkovich was arrested in Yekaterinburg, a manufacturing city in central Russia, where, according to some sources, he was interviewing employees of a tank factory and investigating the Wagner Group, a private militia key to Russia\'s fighting in Ukraine. As the FSB (the intelligence service once known as the KGB) put it in its arrest statement, he was collecting ""information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex."" Or, as a journalist in the West would put it, he was reporting on a story.\n\nUntil a decade ago, that was how Russian authorities would have described the situation as well. But no longer. As the New Yorker\'s Masha Gessen recently noted, the FSB and Russian parliament have since broadened the definition of ""espionage"" to include information-gathering that ""the Russian government sees as threatening the security of the country."" This includes information gathered by journalists and other professionals. The previous law required the prosecution to prove hostile intent; under the new law, this is no longer the case. Nor does it matter whether the information is already public or whether the journalist has yet written a story.\n\nGessen, a former Russian journalist who emigrated to the U.S. a decade ago, describes the new, stricter version of the law as a ""legalistic instrument of terror.""\n\nUnder its provisions, anyone looking too closely at anything regarding state secrets is, ipso facto, a criminal. Nor is the threat merely theoretical. Gessen cites several cases where Russian journalists have been charged with ""high treason"" and sentenced to long prison terms for simply criticizing the war in Ukraine or for reporting on Russian troop movements.\n\nThese cases have deterred many Russian reporters from going down the same road; most of them have long ago left the country. The arrest of Gershkovich may be seen as a message that the law applies to foreign journalists as well.\n\nThe most shocking thing about the Gershkovich case is that such cases are so rare. No American journalist has been arrested in Russia on charges of espionage since Nicholas Daniloff, then a Moscow reporter for U.S. News & World Report, in 1986, a particularly tense time of the Cold War. Even then, Daniloff\'s jailing was seen at the time as retaliation for the arrest of Gennady Zakharov on spying charges. He was released, and traded for Zakharov, two weeks later.\n\nIt is conceivable that Putin might send Gershkovich back to the United States if President Joe Biden offers an appealing trade. But a hostage trade doesn\'t seem to be what Putin and the FSB had in mind when they arrested him in the first place.\n\nBiden has handed the case to the Office of the Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, the usual step after the State Department declares that a U.S. citizen has been ""wrongfully detained"" by a foreign government. Negotiating such trades is a big part of what the office does. Even in this dreadfully tense time for U.S.-Russian relations, it has managed to pull off two high-profile prisoner trades with Moscow, involving women\'s basketball player Brittney Griner and Marine veteran Trevor Reed. But neither of those cases involved accused spies, on either side; and, despite U.S. efforts, Moscow has ignored persistent appeals to free Paul Whelan, an American who has been locked up since 2018 on espionage charges. Meanwhile, Western prisons do hold a few Russians that Moscow would like returned (they are all prominent hackers, one of them the son of a member of parliament), but none of them are accused spies--making it hard to achieve ""equivalence,"" which the Russians usually demand in such trades, even if they often define the term strangely.\n\nThe bad news may be that, in Gershkovich case, Putin isn\'t looking for a trade. He\'s looking to keep his regime, especially its military machine, as opaque as possible. This reporter was trying to pierce that shield, as reporters do. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/04/evan-gershkovich-wrongfully-detained-in-russia.html?via=rss"
"Biden makes huge push for electric vehicles. Is America ready? This is, as President Joe Biden said in a different context, a big f--ing deal. His administration wants to change the way Americans have traveled the roads for more than a century. But by pushing the industry to make the transition faster, Biden could risk a backlash from unwilling consumers, complicate questions about China\'s dominance of electric vehicle supplies, and escalate his administration\'s legal fight with the oil industry and GOP governors who oppose his efforts to phase out internal combustion engines.\n\nOn the plus side for Biden, though, electric vehicle sales are already rising. And carmakers, who are investing big money in going electric, have defended the EPA\'s previous pollution rules in federal court.\n\n""Whether you measure today\'s announcement by the dollars saved or the gallons reduced or the pollution that will no longer be pumped into the air, this is a win for the American people,"" White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nStill, even some supporters of the president\'s climate policies say they worry about a host of complications, including consumers\' ability to afford the $50,000-and-up price of many electric vehicles now on the market. Biden\'s signature climate law offers $7,500 tax breaks to lessen the sticker shock, but the Treasury Department announced rules just two weeks ago that will make those credits more difficult to get.\n\nUnder the EPA proposal unveiled Wednesday, carbon dioxide emissions for new cars and light trucks would need to fall by 49 percent on average from 2027 to 2032. The agency is also proposing tightened standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, with the latter including dump trucks, school buses and tractor-trailers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden drives a Cadillac Lyriq through the showroom during a tour at the Detroit Auto Show on Sept. 14, 2022, in Detroit.   AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File\n\n""Everybody cares about global warming,"" said Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from the auto industry\'s home base of Michigan. But she added, ""I\'m hearing from too many people in this country -- I mean, strong Democrats -- that they can\'t afford an electric vehicle.""\n\nOther obstacles to getting more motorists to go electric include the patchy availability of charging stations and questions about whether the new breed of cars and trucks will be made in the U.S., with American-sourced parts and minerals, or would further dependence on China.\n\nSome Republicans were caustic, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who called the proposal ""another clueless harebrained plan that actually has no basis in reality.""\n\n""That seems to be the joke of the Biden administration -- one of many, in fact -- where they say, \'Oh, you are concerned about rising gas prices, oh, you peasant, go out and buy an electric vehicle that costs $80,000,\'"" Cammack told Fox Business on Monday. ""It\'s absolutely absurd how out of touch this administration truly is.""\n\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) told POLITICO in a statement that the administration\'s proposed rule ""made clear it wants to decide for Americans what kinds of cars and trucks we are allowed to buy, lease, and drive.""\n\n""These misguided emissions standards were made without considering the supply chain challenges American automakers are still facing, the lack of sufficiently operational electric vehicle charging infrastructure, or the fact that it takes nearly a decade to permit a mine to extract the minerals needed to make electric vehicles, forcing businesses to look to China for these raw materials,"" Capito said.\n\nEnvironmental groups and automakers that specialize in electric vehicles, such as Tesla and Rivian, have urged the administration to go big, saying Biden should seize the opportunity to lessen the country\'s largest source of greenhouse gases -- the transportation sector.\n\n""These regulations will reflect, in my view, the single most important regulatory initiative by the Biden administration to combat climate change,"" said Margo Oge, a former head of EPA\'s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, at a briefing Tuesday organized by the Environmental Defense Fund. ""The administration is going to make history if indeed, at the end of the day, they finalize these ambitious standards.""\n\nMatthew Davis, senior director of government relations with the League of Conservation Voters, said the administration should use the EPA rule to ""drive innovation"" -- building on the electric vehicle incentives in Biden\'s infrastructure and climate laws, which have already inspired investments in manufacturing and charging projects.\n\n""If these rules aren\'t strong enough, they won\'t send a strong additional message to the federal investments message that already has been sent,"" Davis said. And that could frustrate the Biden administration\'s hopes of having electric vehicles account for half of all new car and truck sales by 2030.\n\nElectric vehicles made up about 5.6 percent of cars and trucks sold in 2022, up from 1.8 percent just two years earlier -- but still not nearly enough to achieve the large emissions reductions that scientists say are needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, according to data from S&P Global Mobility cited by POLITICO\'s E&E News.\n\nA majority of Americans are at least open to buying an electric vehicle, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. Twelve percent of respondents said they are ""seriously considering"" buying an electric vehicle and another 43 percent said they might consider it in the future, versus 41 percent who ""unequivocally say they would not."" Four percent of respondents already owned one.\n\nYet the interest is highly partisan: 76 percent of Democrats were either seriously or somewhat considering purchasing an electric vehicle, while 71 percent of Republicans said they would not buy one, the polling firm found.\n\nEPA\'s new rules will push automakers toward electric vehicles regardless, said Mike Ramsey, an automotive analyst at the consulting firm Gartner. ""These rules would really just take away any sort of safety net or ability to turn back,"" he told E&E News.\n\nAlready the auto industry, which has eagerly welcomed a variety of tax credits for manufacturing and selling electric vehicles, is deflecting blame in case it can\'t meet the standards.\n\nIn a memo issued last week, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation -- the trade group representing nearly the entire U.S. auto industry -- cautioned that carmakers\' success in meeting strong new standards for lowering pollution will depend on matters outside their control: The proliferation of chargers, the health of the supply chain, the availability of critical minerals, the capacity of the electrical grid and more.\n\nThe move toward electric vehicles ""requires a massive, 100-year change to the U.S. industrial base and the way Americans drive,"" the auto industry group wrote. ""A clear-eyed assessment of market readiness is required. The answer on rule feasibility is: It depends.""\n\n""It\'s a difficult dance,"" said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst for the auto intelligence service at S&P Global Mobility. ""In order to have a more fuel efficient vehicle, it will be more expensive. It will be more expensive to produce; it will be more expensive to buy. It just goes with the territory. And that\'s at the core of the conundrum.""\n\nStill, she said, Europe and China have long had stricter regulations than the United States, so manufacturers already have some practice conforming to higher fuel economy standards.\n\nThe Republican attack line has already become clear, with some accusing the Biden administration of attempts to social-engineer people out of their pickup trucks and into ""some puny electric car,"" as Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) tweeted on Monday.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) called the EPA proposal ""yet another draconian rule from the Biden"" administration and invoked this year\'s partisan dust-up about gas stoves, which one federal regulator had suggested banning. (Biden has opposed a stove ban.)\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) last month chastised the EPA for its efforts to boost electric vehicles, arguing that they strain the grid and are impractical for people like his wife, who he said drives 5,000 miles per month taking their children to school from rural areas.\n\nBy Mike Lee and David Ferris\n\n""I don\'t want \'California\' rules,"" Mullin said, referring to that state\'s electric vehicle mandates. ""I don\'t want them to play a role in Oklahoma. I want affordable and reliable energy.""\n\nThe gas stoves scuffle could seem tame compared with an all-out feud over what\'s in tens of millions of Americans\' driveways. The Obama administration took a GOP strafing over policies aimed at getting people out of their cars in favor of bikes, walking and transit -- outrage that kept the conservative blogosphere buzzing for months. (Writing for Newsweek at the time, George Will dubbed then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood the ""Secretary of Behavior Modification."")\n\nIn contrast, Biden has proclaimed himself a ""car guy."" And his administration and its allies are pitching the new EPA pollution standards as an economic opportunity for the U.S. to dominate the transportation technology of the future.\n\nA recent report from the Environmental Defense Fund and the engineering and design firm WSP USA found that automakers had announced $120 billion in electric vehicle investments since 2015, with the bulk of that money coming since the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act last year.\n\nMuch of that spending, and the jobs that come with it, is happening in red or purple states. Georgia leads the pack on announced new EV jobs, followed by Tennessee, Michigan, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThe administration said the new standards would save the economy $850 billion to $1.6 trillion between 2027 and 2055, avoid about 20 billion barrels in oil imports, and save the average buyer of a car or light-duty truck $12,000 over the vehicle\'s lifetime.\n\nJosh Siegel, Zack Colman, Mike Lee and David Ferris contributed to this report. https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/12/biden-ev-epa-proposal-00091543"

"Legal Abortions Fell by 6 Percent in the Six Months After Dobbs, New Data Shows Abortion access is continuing to change. In the coming days, Florida, which allows abortion through the 15th week of pregnancy and has become a destination for women seeking abortions in the South, is expected to ban it after six weeks. And one of the pills in the two-pill regimen for medication abortion, a method that now represents the majority of legal abortions in America, may be curtailed if a federal court ruling in Texas issued Friday is upheld.\n\nThe new data overestimates the total reduction in abortions, because it does not include people who obtained abortions outside the U.S. health system, such as by ordering pills online from other countries. Previous estimates suggest more than 6,500 women are requesting pills this way each month. That is more than the total decline in legal abortions, though it is uncertain how many of those requests result in abortions.\n\nThe report is from WeCount, a research effort of the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights. It collected abortion counts from 83 percent of clinics, hospitals and telehealth providers in the country. For the places that did not provide data, the group estimated the changes based on historical data and the trends for nearby clinics.\n\nAbortions also fell substantially in states with restrictions that fell shy of complete bans. For example, in Georgia, which outlaws abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, the number of abortions decreased 40 percent.

"Biden to remake U.S. auto industry with toughest emissions limits ever - The Washington Post EPA officials say their rules won't mandate any particular technology, with Regan saying he wants to find flexible ways for the industry to comply. These rules are limits on the emissions each auto company's fleet of sold vehicles will produce. So while the rule changes wouldn't order or require auto companies to sell a certain number of electric vehicles, it would set emissions limits so tightly that the only way to comply would be to sell large percentages of EVs -- or some other type of zero-emissions vehicle. https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/04/12/biden-auto-emissions-rules-climate/"
"You Call This 'Flexible Work'? Rush hour, lunch hour, happy hour -- not so long ago, anyone who worked in Lower Manhattan could tell you what time it was. From 7 to 9 in the morning, men and women streamed toward their offices. Between 5 and 7 in the evening, they streamed home again, maybe stopping by a bar on the way. Then the pandemic hit. The office towers emptied out. Work went on, but from living rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms, over the internet. People had worked from home for years, but not on this scale. Before the pandemic, the rhythms of the day, at least for office workers, were mostly unchanged for a hundred years. But now the industrial-era social compact that governed how we experienced the working day for generations is breaking down. The terms of that compact are so familiar to us that we almost never name them: Labor should be measured by time, in hours and days; people should be paid the same amount for the same work; the day should be broken into periods of labor and leisure.\n\nIn 1938, Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act, requiring that almost all employees be paid a minimum wage per hour, with a 50 percent bonus for overtime after 44 hours in a week. Now updated but still the law of the land, the act formally ratified the division of work time from free time. Until recently, the physical distance between workplace and home helped guarantee these terms. The commute enforced a boundary between professional and personal time that millions observed every day. So, too, did the calendar, dividing days into weekdays for work, weekends for leisure.\n\nToday networked computers are dissolving that division and, with it, the industrial-era time compact. Since computers first became small enough to take home about 50 years ago, and since they became linked to one another in global networks not long after that, a new flexibility has appeared -- and many people love it. Ride-share drivers set their own schedules. Lawyers meet the kids when they come home from school and go back to work after snack time. Call-center operators work when they want and take their calls from the living room. Copywriters, financial analysts and any number of other office workers move out to the country and do their city jobs online. Recent surveys show that most Americans want to continue to work from home at least a few days a week. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/magazine/flexible-work-home.html"

"Pablo Torre Set For FC Barcelona Exit After Club And Agent Meeting: Reports Pablo Torre is set to leave FC Barcelona on loan according to reports.\n\nFC Barcelona star Pablo Torre looks set to head out on loan once a meeting has been held between the club and his entourage, according to SPORT.\n\nThe 20-year-old joined from Racing Santander in the summer, after Barca paid a relatively low €5 million ($5.5 million) for his services.\n\nThough a Pedri-like explosion into Xavi Hernandez's first team midfield was expected of the youngster, things haven't gone to plan for Torre in his first season in Blaugrana.\n\nHe has mustered just just 239 minutes' worth of play across all competitions, and there have also been reports from El Nacional detailing how Xavi has punished him for his taste of nightlife.\n\nWith Barca currently 13 points clear at the top of La Liga, there may be chances for Torre to prove his worth before the end of the season.\n\nLooking ahead to next term, however, Barca are clear that Torre can't spend another season rotting on the bench and ping-ponging between the fringes of the first team and its reserve counterpart Barca athletic.\n\nTo this effect, SPORT reports on Tuesday, it will be suggested at an imminent meeting between the club and his entourage that Torre must head out on loan to another La Liga team to gain top flight experience.\n\nSeveral clubs elsewhere in Spain are reportedly interested in Torre, with Villarreal already asking about his availability in January as Osasuna, Celta Vigo and Almeria have also made their enquiries.\n\nTorre has always been reluctant to leave, even if temporarily on loan, but might have to rethink his approach if he wants to succeed in Catalonia.\n\nHe would do well to follow the example of Morocco international Ez Abde, who after being given a few starts by Xavi was later shipped out to Osasuna.\n\nAbde has impressed there, helping lead the Basque club to the Copa del Rey final where they will meet Real Madrid and scoring a late brace in Monday's 2-1 win over Elche.\n\nFor his exploits, Abde will likely be recalled by Xavi this summer to fill in at right back. And if he can also turn the page at a high level elsewhere, Torre could finally take a central role in the head coach's plans upon his return. https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2023/04/12/pablo-torre-set-for-fc-barcelona-exit-after-club-and-agent-meeting-reports/"
"So when will you get your state pensions? It may have risen by a record 10.1 per cent earlier this week -- but how much longer can the state pension last in its current form?\n\nThat's the big question that has emerged from a newly published report commissioned by the Government.\n\nA major review of the state pension concluded that it is simply becoming too costly; something will have to give.\n\nPension pressure: Britain's state pension age - currently 66 - could rise as high as 74 for many of those toiling away today\n\nAccording to experts who have analysed the report, either the state pension age will have to rise rapidly -- hitting anyone under 40 particularly hard -- or the triple lock (the mechanism that ensures payouts increase in line with whichever is higher -- prices, earnings or 2.5 per cent) will need to be axed very soon.\n\nThe debate comes just as France reels from protests over plans to hike the retirement age from 62 to 64 due to the unwieldy cost of paying a guaranteed pension to a rapidly ageing population.\n\nIn Britain, we face many of the same dilemmas (without the rioting).\n\nThankfully, the Government has delayed any decisions until after the next General Election. But, ultimately, Britain's state pension age -- currently 66 -- could rise as high as 74 for many of those toiling away today.\n\nWorried? Confused? Here's everything you need to know about when you can claim your state pension…\n\nAs it stands, the age at which you start to collect your state pension (now £10,600 a year) is 66.\n\nBut this will rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. This means the state pension age for women will have increased by seven years between 2010 and 2028.\n\nThe change will be phased in, so there will be periods when the state pension age is 66 years and between one and 11 months.\n\nBut if you were born after March 5, 1961 and are 62 or younger today, you will not be entitled to a payout until you are at least 67.\n\nThe next increase to age 68 was not planned until 2046 but the Government was rumoured to be considering bringing that forward to 2035. That would have affected anyone born between 1968 and 1979.\n\nHowever, the Government delayed the decision until after the next election.\n\nSo, as it stands, someone currently aged 45 or younger won't get their state pension until they reach 68 years old.\n\nEvery few years, the state pension age is reviewed by the Government.\n\nLast year, ministers commissioned an independent report to inform the latest review.\n\nThis was carried out by Conservative peer Lucy Neville-Rolfe. Every year, the cost of paying out a provision to pensioners increases by billions of pounds as it rises under the triple lock.\n\nThis week's 10.1 per cent increase (in line with last September's rate of inflation) is expected to cost the Treasury an additional £11billion.\n\nThe rising number of people reaching state pension age -- and longer life expectancies -- are also adding to the bill.\n\nThis means the state must pay an old age income to more people for longer than it once did.\n\nAt the same time, the number of workers -- who pick up the state pension bill via taxes -- has continued to shrink.\n\nThe state pension's enormous cost is only expected to keep rising. Lady Neville-Rolfe backs the Government's aim to limit the rise in state pension costs between now and 2070 to 6 per cent of GDP (our gross national income).\n\nSpending on pensions, health and social care is currently equivalent to 15.1 per cent of GDP and will rise to 25.6 per cent by the 2070s as the number of pensioners increases from 12million to 17million.\n\nThe state pension cost taxpayers £110billion in 2022/23 -- equal to 5.5 per cent of GDP.\n\nThis could spiral to £142billion and exceed the 6 per cent limit by 2025, according to calculations by Becky O'Connor, of PensionBee, using forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which keeps tabs on state spending.\n\nThis means the state pension could be classed as 'unaffordable' by the Government in just two years, she says.\n\nRising costs: The next increase to age 68 was not planned until 2046 but the Government was rumoured to be considering bringing that forward to 2035\n\nThe mechanism for increasing the payments each year, known as the state pension triple lock, is therefore under threat, says Ms O'Connor.\n\n'It looks as though state pension spending could be at risk of breaching a 6 per cent limit within a matter of years,' she says.\n\n'So, this opens up a whole new set of uncertainties around the triple lock and whether or not it would be possible to continue to use it.'\n\nWithout the triple lock, millions of pensioners would see their standard of living fall as incomes fail to keep pace with the cost of living.\n\nCapping state pension spending at 6 per cent could mean that the state pension receives no increases in some years -- unless something else gives, says Ms O'Connor. 'Increasing the state pension age might be the only option,' she says.\n\nJohn Cridland, who ran the last independent report on the state pension age in 2017, warned MPs last month that the triple lock should be axed to stop the pension age from rising.\n\nBaroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, says calculations she ran during her time in office showed that scrapping the element of the triple lock that guarantees a minimum 2.5 per cent increase every year would prevent the need to raise state pension age -- or at least reduce the pressure on endless hikes.\n\nToday's workers could be in for a much longer wait to get their hard-earned state pension. Many younger people face waiting until their mid-70s, experts warn.\n\nAlice Guy, of stockbroker Interactive Investor, warns that a 30-year-old today might not get their state pension until they reach 74 if the 6 per cent spending cap is kept in place.\n\nThis would mean they miss out on eight years of state pension compared with someone hitting state pension age today. That's an estimated £209,432 of income foregone, Ms Guy says.\n\nHer analysis, based on the Baroness Neville-Rolfe's independent review, found a 40-year-old is likely to have to wait until they are 70.\n\nSteven Cameron, of pensions firm Aegon, agrees that aggressive hikes to the state pension age could be on the cards.\n\n'It's not unconceivable that pension age rises beyond 70 when you look at how quickly it is increasing from 65 to 68,' he says.\n\nA further increase to the age of 69 is already projected to happen between 2046 and 2048. This means those born in 1977, aged 46 today, could be the first to face a longer wait.\n\nSo far, men who reached state pension age between 1996 and 2020 have spent 31 per cent of their lives in retirement, according to the report.\n\nBut with rising life expectancy, the state pension age must increase to keep the balance at 31 per cent.\n\nBaroness Neville-Rolfe, says it would need to rise to 68 between 2041 and 2043 -- faster than is currently legislated -- and to 69 between 2058 and 2060, slower than currently projected.\n\nHowever, reducing the percentage of your life that you are on the state pension from 31 per cent to 30 per cent would require the minimum pension age to increase to 70 by 2062.\n\nWhen it was first introduced in 1909, the state pension was paid only to men and women over the age of 70.\n\nAnalysis of data from the Office for National Statistics found that almost a third of people did not expect to have any pension provision beyond the state pension when they retired\n\nYou should be given plenty of notice if you face a hike in your state pension age. The Government has promised to give ten years' warning in advance of any changes.\n\nEven so, many in ill health or physically demanding jobs may struggle to stay in work into their 70s.\n\nHowever, they may find they are unable to afford to retire without the state pension and have to find extra income from somewhere.\n\nAnalysis of data from the Office for National Statistics found that almost a third of people did not expect to have any pension provision beyond the state pension when they retired.\n\nCarole Easton, of the Centre for Ageing Better, warns that being too hasty in raising the state pension age can have devastating consequences.\n\nResearch that her think-tank carried out with the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that the number of 65-year-olds living in poverty more than doubled in the two years after the state pension age increased to 66.\n\n'Future increases should be delivered cautiously and with significant advance notice or risk plunging huge numbers of older people into poverty,' she says.\n\nIf the official state pension age rises to 70, the rules may be made more flexible.\n\nThe Government has long been urged to consider letting people access the state pension early if they are in poor health, can't work because they need to care for a loved one or if they have worked in more physically demanding jobs.\n\nThe report by Baroness Neville-Rolfe asked the Government to explore this - for example, by running a test that allows people to take their state pension early in return for a lower weekly income.\n\nMr Cameron says his company Aegon has also called on the Government to give older workers this opportunity.\n\nIt would mean that those who do decide to trigger it early accept receiving less as a trade-off.\n\nThis ensures they do not receive more than their fair share over the course of their retirement. 'It is feasible that the state pension age rises to 70 and this option of early access would make it far more palatable for people,' he says.\n\nBaroness Altmann says that paying out early to those who have extra long National Insurance records is another option.\n\n'If this is allowed then asking people to wait until age 70 might be easier, especially as more people build a private pension that can tide them over to state pension,' she says.\n\nj.beard@dailymail.co.uk https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/pensions/article-11961943/So-state-pensions.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

"Etihad Airways Criticized For Making 'Misleading' Environmental Claims In Facebook Ads An Etihad Airways Airbus A350 aircraft seen flying over the Netherlands on November 23, 2022 (Photo: ... [ ] Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe United Kingdom\'s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ruled that the Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad Airways made a number of ""exaggerated"" claims about its environmental credentials and breached the country\'s advertising code.\n\nIn a decision issued on April 12, the advertising watchdog said the airline had exaggerated the impact that flying with Etihad would have on the environment in two ads it ran on Facebook in October last year.\n\nIn the first ad, the airline said ""We understand the impact flying has on the environment. That\'s why we are taking a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation"" and talked about customers making ""a conscious choice for the planet"".\n\nIn the second, it said it was cutting back on single-use plastics on board its aircraft and was ""flying the most modern and efficient planes. Flights with a smaller footprint.""\n\nEtihad told the ASA that its claim about ""sustainable aviation"" was not meant to imply that it offered a complete solution to the environmental impact of flying, but should be understood as a long-term approach, in line with the airline\'s aspiration to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nHowever, the ASA noted that neither ad mentioned Etihad\'s aim to achieve net-zero by 2050 or positioned the ""sustainable aviation"" claim as a long-term aspiration.\n\nIn its ruling, the ASA pointed out that air travel continued to produce high levels of carbon dioxide and other emissions which were making a substantial contribution to climate change and that many of the airline\'s initiatives ""were targeted to only deliver results years or decades into the future"".\n\nUnder the UK\'s advertising code, environmental claims have to be supported by a high level of substantiation. But the watchdog said there are ""currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry which would adequately substantiate an absolute green claim such as \'sustainable aviation\' as we considered consumers would interpret it"".\n\nIt added that, in its view, ""reducing single use plastics and using more efficient aircraft were not adequate substantiation to evidence a \'sustainable aviation\' claim"".\n\nThe ASA has told Etihad it must ensure its ads do not give a misleading impression of the impact of air travel and that it provides ""robust substantiation"" for any claims it makes in the future.\n\nEtihad issued a statement saying it was ""disappointed by ASA\'s decision"" and said it would continue to take steps to make flying more sustainable than it would otherwise be, including working with aircraft and engine manufacturers, sustainable fuel suppliers and others.\n\nThe airline has previously been involved in developing sustainable aviation fuel and taken steps to reduce the use of fuel by testing contrail management mechanisms and optimising aircraft ascents and descents.\n\nThe Gulf carrier is not the first airline to fall foul off the ASA with environmental claims made in a marketing campaign. In March, Germany\'s Lufthansa was pulled up for making misleading claims about its environmental impact in an ad in June 2022 and the ASA issued a similar ruling about ads by Ireland\'s Ryanair RYAAY in 2019. https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2023/04/12/etihad-airways-criticized-for-making-misleading-environmental-claims-in-facebook-ads/"
"Gourmet Dog Food Has Pet Owners Sending Kibbles Back Like so many 2-year-olds, Bear is a picky eater.\n\nWhen Bear, a 120-pound Great Pyrenees, seemed bored with the dry food his owner, Margaret Pless, fed him day after day, she gave him canned food from Costco. Bear hated it. Next, she tried pricey refrigerated dog food. When that failed to please Bear\'s palate, Ms. Pless made his food for a few months. He liked it, but it was an exhausting, time-consuming process, and she was left wondering whether Bear was getting all the nutrients he needed.\n\nSo in November 2021, Ms. Pless signed up for a subscription to The Farmer\'s Dog, which provides customized dog food marketed as made with human-grade ingredients. The recipe list reads more like a homemade stew: beef or turkey with vegetables, such as carrots and brussels sprouts. The food is cooked at low temperatures before being portioned out and shipped to Ms. Pless\'s home in Dover, Mass.\n\n""The company made claims that dogs would love this food and never get tired of it,"" said Ms. Pless, a part-time church administrator and dog boarder, who said she was spending up to $13 per day feeding Bear the human-grade food, up from the dry-food cost of around $3 per day.\n\nBut Bear was unimpressed. ""At first he was excited,"" Ms. Pless said. ""And then he was like, \'Oh, it\'s this stuff again,\' and he got bored. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/business/human-grade-dog-food.html"

"On Long Flights, Airlines Offer Couch Seating It\'s a long-haul traveler\'s dream: Tired and facing a flight of 10-plus hours in the back of the plane, you watch as, one by one, passengers walk by and no one sits next to you. The cabin doors close, and that\'s when it hits you: You\'ve got the row to yourself. Jackpot!\n\nNow, some airlines are giving passengers the chance to pay for that form of traveler\'s ecstasy, by offering a sleeper-seat option in the main cabin.

After takeoff, they can stretch out like a king, even in the heart of coach.\n\n""No frills.

"Ted Cruz said school shootings can be prevented if they have armed guards, like in banks. That aged poorly after the deadly Louisville bank shooting. Texas Sen.

"Amp to develop green hydrogen project  in South Australia Canada-based Amp Energy, a global energy transition development platform, has signed an agreement with Australian iron ore exploration and mining company Iron Road Ltd. to develop green hydrogen at scale on the Cape Hardy Port precinct.\n\nCape Hardy is located on the east coast of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, approximately 7 kilometres south of Port Neill. It comprises 1,200ha of undeveloped coastal land, wholly owned by Iron Road which aims to develop the area into a world-class green hydrogen and industrial port precinct with multi-commodity capability.\n\nFollowing a three-month competitive offer-to-bid process, Iron Road announced that Amp Energy has been selected as the lead developer for the Cape Hardy green hydrogen project and the companies executed a strategic framework agreement and commenced a nine-month exclusivity period during which a detailed project schedule and scope of work will be developed.\n\nIron Road CEO Larry Ingle said: ""We are delighted to be working exclusively with Amp for the next nine months, and beyond, on a green energy production and export development opportunity of national significance. This important milestone further validates Cape Hardy as South Australia\'s pre-eminent hydrogen export hub of scale. Our competitive offer-to-bid process was carefully designed to screen the most capable and motivated developer looking to prioritise and advance the project quickly and judiciously.""\n\nAmp said it was drawn to the Cape Hardy project due to its strategic geographic location and strong support from the South Australia Government. The Cape Hardy site has direct access to high-voltage power through existing transmission infrastructure as well as a deep-water port that will facilitate the transportation of the hydrogen product, the company explained.\n\nFurthermore, both the Traditional Owners of the land (the Barngala people) and the Eyre Peninsula landowners have strong relationships with the project, and the Australian Government has already shown firm support through its earlier announcement of $25 million for further port infrastructure development. These factors will support the project to produce green hydrogen at competitive global prices and help South Australia meet its green hydrogen goals, Amp stated.\n\nThe company intends to develop and build up to 5 GW of electrolyser capacity over the next decade in the precinct, delivering over 5 million tons per annum (mtpa) of green ammonia, which is expected to establish South Australia as a global leader in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia. At this scale, 4,800 direct and indirect construction jobs and 250 direct and indirect operations jobs are expected to be created, Amp added.\n\n""Our background of developing large-scale upstream power systems globally positions Amp for the emerging opportunity of green hydrogen and provides industrial synergies"", commented Paul Ezekiel, Co-Founder and CIO of Amp. ""The development of strategically located, transmission-connected green hydrogen and ammonia facilities at select locations such as Cape Hardy in South Australia is critical to our continued global growth and long-term strategy.""\n\nThe South Australia Government is also supportive of the Cape Hardy Precinct: ""South Australia\'s world-leading renewable energy reputation continues to strengthen. The Cape Hardy precinct speaks to our state\'s hydrogen production capabilities. As a leading global hydrogen energy developer and asset owner, we welcome Amp\'s continued strategic commitment to South Australia. This project complements my government\'s commitment to hydrogen, through the Hydrogen Jobs Plan. The Hydrogen opportunity will be transformative for the South Australian economy, delivering energy security – while helping the state decarbonise"", stated The Honourable Peter Malinauskas MP Premier of South Australia. https://www.offshore-energy.biz/amp-to-develop-green-hydrogen-project-in-south-australia/"

"Europe will launch a spacecraft to Jupiter. Here's how to watch. Europe is about to send a spacecraft on an epic quest to study Jupiter\'s icy moons, a mission that won\'t begin in earnest for another eight years when it finally reaches its deep space destination.\n\nThe so-called ""Juice"" mission is intended to focus its research on Europa, Callisto, and particularly Ganymede, three large moons orbiting the gas giant planet a half-billion miles away. These moons(Opens in a new tab) have intrigued scientists for years, because they\'re thought to have liquid oceans trapped beneath icy shells.\n\nGanymede is the largest moon in the solar system and the only one known to have its own magnetic field, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). The mission will explore(Opens in a new tab) these worlds and investigate whether life could have ever flourished in this realm.\n\nThe ESA will attempt to launch Juice(Opens in a new tab) on an Ariane 5 rocket from its spaceport in French Guiana on the South American continent. It will be the space agency\'s last time using the rocket before it transitions to a new propulsion system. Liftoff is slated for 8:15 a.m. EST / 14:15 CEST Thursday April 13.\n\nTo understand the possibility of habitability, scientists need to explore the Jupiter system as a whole, said Olivier Witasse, a Juice mission scientist, during a recent ESA news conference. That means learning as much as they can about Jupiter\'s atmosphere and weather, strong rotating magnetic field, the volcanic moon Io, the other moons, and how they\'re all interconnected.\n\nWant more science and tech news delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up for Mashable\'s Top Stories newsletter today.\n\n""Jupiter, it\'s really a miniaturized solar system,"" Witasse said. ""It\'s the key to understand our own solar system -- how it was formed, how it evolved with time.""\n\nBefore reaching Jupiter, the spacecraft will make flybys of Earth and Venus to get enough energy to slingshot to the outer solar system, reaching Jupiter in 2031(Opens in a new tab). If successful, it will be the first time in history a spacecraft has ever orbited a moon other than Earth\'s when it loops around Ganymede in 2034. NASA and the Japanese and Israeli space agencies have contributed scientific instruments for the mission.\n\n""Juice"" is a wonky acronym for Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer(Opens in a new tab), fitting for Ganymede\'s mythological namesake, who served as Jupiter\'s personal cupholder(Opens in a new tab). The study seeks to answer several key questions: How do gas giants like Jupiter function; how did Jupiter\'s moons form; could there have been life on or around Jupiter in its past or even now; what are these oceanic moons like; and what makes Ganymede so different?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the mission was designing a spacecraft and instruments for the unusual environment around Jupiter. Particles from the volcanic moon Io are trapped by Jupiter\'s potent magnetic field, creating extreme radiation.\n\n""We really had to put all the most sensitive equipment inside vaults, literally boxes lined with lead, that will stop most of the radiation from reaching the electronics,"" said Alessandro Atzei, the payload system engineer.\n\nThe launch will be streamed live on ESA Web TV(Opens in a new tab) and YouTube(Opens in a new tab), from 7:45 -- 10:05 a.m. EST.

"Austin Maestro, Ford Orion and Vauxhall Nova will become CLASSIC CARS in 2023 When someone mentions the term 'classic car' you may likely think of glorious Aston Martin DB5s, stunning Ferrari 250 GTOs and other vintage vehicles from yesteryear that command seven-figure sums each time they change ownership.\n\nThe models you probably don't think of are Austin Maestros, Fiat Unos or Ford Orions. And certainly not the Vauxhall Nova!\n\nBut these unlikely cars will fall into the 'classic' bracket from this year...\n\nUnlikely classics of 2023: We've listed 10 motors that turn 40 this year and therefore begin to qualify for 'historical vehicle' benefits, such as VED and MOT test exemption - including the Austin Maestro, Ford Orion and Vauxhall Nova. But does this automatically make them 'classic' cars?\n\nThe definition of when a car earns 'classic' status is a matter for debate. However, many believe it officially happens when a model turns 40 and therefore qualifies for 'historical vehicle' exemption from vehicle excise duty (VED) - or car tax.\n\nWhen cars reach their 40th birthday they also no longer require an annual MOT due to the low volume of surviving examples - and those still on the road are likely cherished by their keepers and are maintained to a high standard.\n\nHitting the four decade mark also means cars are automatically exempt from some clean air zone charges, including London's £12.50-a-day Ultra Low Emission Zone - or ULEZ - sting.\n\nThe Maestro, Uno, Orion and Nova are among a number of models that will do just that in 2023 having first gone on sale in the UK 1983 - though there are other more deserving cars in this top 10 list that earn classic status this year.\n\nBut just because they qualify for historical vehicle benefits, this doesn't mean this newfound 'classic' status will instantly make them more valuable.\n\nTo put their current value into context, we can tell you which have risen in price recent years - and which have not.\n\nHagerty UK, which specialises in collectible car values by tracking auction and private sales, has provided us with information about their change in value since 2021.\n\nBy 1983 standards, this is what constituted a sleek car design. The Alfa 33 arrived 40 years with lots of excitement, but a few niggling issues prevented it from becoming a major UK seller\n\nWhen the Alfa 33 first arrived in 1983 there were big hopes pinned on its square-shaped haunches. Its sleek and aerodynamic looks (for the 1980s), powerful boxer engines and nimble handling, initially saw it receive rave reviews from road testers. And it also featured numerous innovative features, not least its clever instrument cluster, which moves up and down with the adjustable steering wheel for maximum dial visibility.\n\nUnfortunately, unreliable electronics and rust plagued them over the years. Today, there's believed to be fewer than 50 on the road in Britain.\n\nJohn Mayhead, Hagerty UK's Price Guide editor, tells us that Alfa 33 values have 'crept up' over the last few years, with the average price of these cars £2,475, which is a 1 per cent increase on where they were in 2021.\n\n'The car is still a hard sell – it comes from a tricky time in Alfa Romeo's history – but there are a few track cars out there that are competitive and look the part. The 33 has two things going for it: the great little boxer engine, and rarity… so few are left today,' John explains.\n\nRemember the Maestro? It was launched in March 1983, meaning it turns 40 this year and technically begins to qualify for historical vehicle tax exemption\n\nMoment mum calls 999 after son murdered Somerset schoolboy\n\nIce-T's wife Coco Austin dances with their daughter Chanel\n\nFighting on Bakhmut frontline seen from Ukrainian soldier's bodycam\n\nWoman gives birth on San Francisco sidewalk 'after smoking crack'\n\nDad claims he's captured an angel on his Ring doorbell\n\nBrooke Shields says that her mom was 'in love' with her\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy speaks Spanish in promotion for Super Mario Bros\n\nPolice swarm Wells Fargo bank amid reported 'hostage situation'\n\nEva Mendes makes fun of her Sydney waterfront home\n\nIncredible video shows Elon Musk's plan to land people on Red Planet\n\n6 ft 2 woman bullied for height says dating is almost impossible\n\nAlice Fevronia explains bicarbonate of soda and baking powder\n\nThe Maestro was launched on 1 March 1983 in a bid to save troubled British Leyland. The replacement for both the Austin Maxi and Allegro remained in production for almost 13 years and some 605,000 came off the assembly line.\n\nIn 1995, official records showed that just over 230,000 were still in existence. An Auto Express survey in 2006 then revealed the Maestro was one of the most scrapped cars of the preceding 30 years, with just over 11,500 examples with registered owners 15 years ago. That number has shrunk considerably, with a little over 100 believed to be on the road at the end of 2022, as rust has taken hold of most examples.\n\nFor those considering hunting one down for classic ownership, the limited edition Vanden Plas Maestro is the one to go for, says Hagerty. These innovatively had an electronic talking dashboard with a pre-programmed 32-word vocabulary warning system that could speak to you in 15 different languages. However, even these have seen only a very modest rise in value, increasing by an average of £25 since 2021 (from £3,250 to £3,275).\n\nJohn says the rarity of the Maestro Vanden Plas could 'come into play' in the future: 'There are still some immaculate Maestros out there, and their owners are spending real money on keeping them that way.'\n\nFiat went all out on the Uno, developing a totally new platform and drafted in the expertise of Ital Design for the styling. Few remain today\n\nFiat had earned a solid reputation for producing great small cars by the early eighties, thanks mostly to the Panda. And in 1983 it broadened its range with the arrival of the Uno, which replaced the 127. It arrived in UK showrooms in June that year.\n\nThe Italian marque spared no expense for the 'One'. It benefited from an all-new platform and the boxy styling was penned by Ital Design, which was also responsible for the original Volkswagen Golf and Lancia Delta. At the time, it had excellent aerodynamics. Spacious inside, it was also applauded for its practicality. It even received the ultimate accolade of being voted 1984 European Car of the Year, beating all nine rivals appearing in this list.\n\nWhile there are still thousands on the road in Fiat's native Italy, DVLA records show that fewer than 200 examples are still registered in use in the UK today, meaning only a few drivers will reap the reward of tax, MOT and clean air zone exemption from 2023.\n\nHagerty doesn't track Uno values right now, but for collectors who want to invest in one the Uno Turbo is the unicorn version to keep an eye out for. There aren't many left, but quality examples going to auction in recent years have sold for around £10,000 to £13,000.\n\nThe Mk2 Fiesta turns 40 as the nameplate's 47-year production history is due to come to an end, with Ford announcing it will be culling the Fiesta for good in June\n\nMoment mum calls 999 after son murdered Somerset schoolboy\n\nIce-T's wife Coco Austin dances with their daughter Chanel\n\nWoman gives birth on San Francisco sidewalk 'after smoking crack'\n\nDad claims he's captured an angel on his Ring doorbell\n\nBlake Lively parodies Gwyneth Paltrow trial in Betty Buzz ad\n\nHoward Stern 'dumbfounded' by Kid Rock's Bud Light reaction\n\nBrooke Shields says that her mom was 'in love' with her\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy speaks Spanish in promotion for Super Mario Bros\n\nEva Mendes makes fun of her Sydney waterfront home\n\nIncredible video shows Elon Musk's plan to land people on Red Planet\n\n6 ft 2 woman bullied for height says dating is almost impossible\n\nAlice Fevronia explains bicarbonate of soda and baking powder\n\nHaving first entered the market in 1976, the Ford Fiesta was due an update by 1983, with the Mk2 model hitting showrooms that year. Yet, having pumped huge financial resources into the development of the original car, Ford bosses tasked its engineering team with making as few changes as possible.\n\nArguably the most important new feature was the availability of a 1.6-litre diesel engine - and an oil burner remained an option on Fiestas up until 2020. Ford also fitted Mk2 cars with a brand new dashboard and security was bolstered by Chubb locks to keep car thieves at bay. It was a huge success, especially in the UK. In its best year - 1987 - more than 150,000 were bought by Britons, though it was still outsold by the incredibly popular Escort.\n\nSadly, 2023 will be the last year the Fiesta will be made, with Ford announcing that production of Britain's most-bought and most-owned passenger car will cease in June ahead of the arrival of a new electrified model with a fresh nameplate. This will likely see values of collectible Fiesta models rise, which in this case is the Mk2 XR2 hot hatch.\n\nJohn says average XR2 values have increased by 11.5 per cent over the last three years, with the very best cars now making over £20,000. 'We expect this one to keep rising as more are restored,' he added.\n\nWith saloon cars still popular in the 1980s, Ford brought the Orion to market in 1983 to sit alongside the hugely popular Escort\n\nWith the Escort a resounding success in the eighties and topping the UK sales charts every year from 1982 to 1989, Ford bosses still believed there was a void in the market left by the Cortina, which ceased production in '82 having been available across five generations spanning 20 years.\n\nTo appease those who preferred saloon cars (which were popular at the time), the blue oval brand launched the Orion in 1983, which was closely based on the Mk3 Escort. It was an odd marketing move given that it was dangerously close in proportion to the bigger Sierra (launched in 1982). In fact, it offered better rear legroom and a more capacious boot than its sister model.\n\nOrions would go on to mirror the Escort across three generations in total, with the saloon eventually culled from the range in 1993. Yet fewer than 300 are said to be on the road today.\n\nSuch exclusivity has seen Orion values rise relatively sharply by 15 per cent in the last three years. However, this is starting from a very low base, with average values now up to £3,895, says John. He tells us that the very best examples are reaching nearly £7,000.\n\nThe Land Rover 110 launched in 1983 and started a new era for the British brand's hardened 4X4 models. The early 'County' versions (like the one pictured) are becoming very collectible indeed\n\nThe first Defender - as we later came to know it - appeared in 1983 as the Land Rover 110, with the five-door model introduced that year to replace the Series III Land Rover. The three-door Land Rover 90 followed a year later, though the 'Defender 110' and 'Defender 90' names didn't get used until 1990.\n\nWhile the utilitarian pick-up and 4X4 were still available as workhorse off-road vehicles, 'County' models became the multi-purpose family model with more comfortable seats and interior trim befitting that of a conventional car.\n\nMost desirable of the range was the V8 County Station Wagon, featuring the same 3.5-litre engine and gearbox as fitted to the Range Rover. It also had improved interior trim plus distinctive body stripes. Earlier - and most desirable models - came with sliding windows, flush door handles and a seat-box mounted high and low range gear selector lever.\n\nHagerty has tracked big value increases for earlier 'Series' Land Rovers and latter collectible Defenders, but says this 'middle ground' 110 is now a good option, with average values of TD5 turbodiesel variants rising by 1.2 per cent in the last 36 months to an average of £29,750. John tells us: 'Values have crept up over the last three years having already risen a lot, but today the very best examples, especially clean, well-maintained station wagons – are likely to retain and indeed increase in value.'\n\nOut of all the cars in this list, the one that arguably had the biggest impression was the Peugeot 205, launched in February 1983. The GTi hot hatch versions are soaring in value, and even modest performance variants are starting to rise in value\n\nThe Peugeot 205 launched in February 1983, which means it has already celebrated its 40th birthday. Larger than most conventional superminis that were on sale at the time, it also arrived with five doors as a more practical, grown-up alternative to existing market rivals.\n\nThe flash French newcomer also offered a new curved design that stood apart from vehicles making up the segment in '83 - mostly thanks to Peugeot moving away from Pininfarina design and using the company's in-house stylists to pen its shape.\n\nWhile it didn't become an instant hit, the 205 would go on to become arguably the brand's most important car, cementing the manufacturer in the modern era thanks to a quality product, huge array of engines (with power ranging from 45 to 200hp), the huge success of the 205 GTi hot hatch (launched in April 1984), motorsport acclaim and some very clever marketing.\n\nThis included some of the most iconic TV ads of the eighties, including one where the 205 is chased and bombed on a frozen lake by a military plane (see it above).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the value of the fastest 205s have soared in recent years, and the fact it turns 40 in 1983 will bolster this. You'll do well to find a top notch quality condition GTi for less than £30,000, and the record highest amount paid for a Group B-spec T16 Turbo is a massive £876,300. However, there are more modestly-priced 205s that are also rising in value, such as the 1.3-litre 'Rallye', which is up 5.3 per cent in the last year, according to Hagerty data.\n\nThe Toyota AE86 is the car turning 40 this year that has seen the biggest rise in value in the last 3 years. Prices have shot up by 27% since 2021 thanks to the rear-wheel-drive JDM model earning cult status\n\nIce-T's wife Coco Austin dances with their daughter Chanel\n\nFighting on Bakhmut frontline seen from Ukrainian soldier's bodycam\n\nWoman gives birth on San Francisco sidewalk 'after smoking crack'\n\nLouisville gunman threatened to 'kill everyone' at bank in voicemail\n\nBlake Lively parodies Gwyneth Paltrow trial in Betty Buzz ad\n\nBrooke Shields says that her mom was 'in love' with her\n\nResidents evacuated after fire at Richmond recycling plant\n\nPolice swarm Wells Fargo bank amid reported 'hostage situation'\n\nEva Mendes makes fun of her Sydney waterfront home\n\n6 ft 2 woman bullied for height says dating is almost impossible\n\nAlice Fevronia explains bicarbonate of soda and baking powder\n\nMedics in converted bus transport wounded Ukrainian soldiers to hospital\n\nThe 'AE86' is one of only a handful of cars that is referred by its factory codename rather than its model nameplate (Corolla). What made AE86 earn this badge of honour is its rear-wheel-drive setup, turning a practical and reliable family car into a petrolhead's dream drift machine. This means owners - from 1983 - could drop the kids off at school and then thoroughly enjoy the journey home.\n\nThe AE86 was hugely popularised in the 2000s by the early Playstation Grand Turismo games and appearance in the Fast and Furious movie franchise. It was such a hit that values have been rising for years, with enthusiasts and nostalgic former owners desperate to get their hands on the remaining Japanese cult cars.\n\nThis has seen most surviving cars enter collections and become cherished possessions, which means there are few in neglected condition. And in terms of value increases, the Toyota has seen the biggest jump in prices of all ten cars featured in our list, rising by a whopping 27 per cent on average in three years, according to Hagerty. Expect to pay around £33,950 if you want one in 2023, compared to the average sale price of £26,700 in 2021.\n\nJohn tells us that the AE86 has become a 'Millennial favourite' with 68 per cent of all owners quoted by Hagerty born after 1981. 'Values of JDM (Japanese Domestic Market) performance cars have been soaring, and this ticks all the boxes in terms of performance, looks, limited numbers and cultural references. With so few out there, good ones, especially home market cars with history, will remain very collectable.'\n\n'I ain't over my Vauxhall Nova': It's hard to believe that earliest Nova models on the road today begin to qualify for historical vehicle benefits, having first gone on sale in the UK in early 1983\n\nA Vauxhall Corsa is probably one of the last cars you'd consider a 'classic', but 2023 marks 40 years since it first went on sale in the UK, having been launched elsewhere in Europe a year earlier in 1982. That means the earliest versions of the Nova now qualify for historical vehicle benefits, such as VED and MOT exemption.\n\nNo urban estate in the nineties was complete without a Nova being razzed through the streets by a baseball cap-wearing boy racer - which was a common reason for most to head to a scrapyard. But while only few will have fond memories of Vauxhall's first attempt at a supermini, many will still fondly recall the popular comedy bumper stickers that adorned them, with the most common being 'YOU'VE BEEN NOVA-TAKEN' and 'CASA-NOVA'.\n\nA reputation for rust - particularly around the rear arches and bottom of the doors - and plenty of gearbox issues means there are fewer than 1,000 left on the roads today.\n\nWhile values are only creeping higher, find the much-lusted over GTE variant and you should expect to have to pay in excess of £10,000 for one. So unlikely is the Nova to be considered a 'classic', Hagerty doesn't track values of this model at all.\n\nVolkswagen all but confirmed earlier this month that the current Mk8 Golf will be the last sold with a petrol or diesel engine as part of its plans to transition to electric vehicles. This could see the value of Mk2 Golfs (pictured) - launched in 1983 - soar\n\nYou may have spotted last week that Volkswagen has all but confirmed that the current Mk8 Golf will be the last sold with petrol and diesel engines, with the brand outlining its plans to launch its last internal combustion engine model (the next-generation T-Roc) in 2026 and the Golf name likely reserved for a future electric vehicle.\n\nThis will disappoint plenty of fans of VW's best-selling car. But it will be especially good news for owners of earlier Golfs, who are likely to see the value of their motors rise in the coming years as a result of this announcement. This includes the Mk2 Golf, which arrived in 1983 and officially turns 40 this year.\n\nThe second iteration had only minor changes from the Mk1, with a Giugiaro-penned rounder body, a line-up of familiar engines and an almost identical interior. But what it lacked in cutting-edge evolution it made up for with incredible build quality and reliability, which was unmatched in 1983 and saw the Mk2 Golf hit the top of the European sales charts in the eighties.\n\nThe GTI hot hatch models are the ones worth investing in today, though the Mk2 has not yet seen the double-digit increases of its earlier Mk I ancestor. However, values are strong and growing, up just over 3 per cent in three years (from £14,425 to £14,875).\n\n'Values are continuing to rise: the average Hagerty quoted value has risen by close to 50 per cent in the last year alone,' John says. 'Another car dominated by younger buyers (about 90 per cent of owners requesting Hagerty quotes were born since 1965), values are likely to keep increasing. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-11920269/Austin-Maestro-Ford-Orion-Vauxhall-Nova-CLASSIC-CARS-2023.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

"Professors are using ChatGPT detector tools to accuse students of cheating. But what if the software is wrong? When William Quarterman logged into his student web portal to check the results of his history exam, he was shocked to see a cheating accusation from his professor attached to it.\n\nHis professor had used artificial intelligence detection software including one called GPTZero after noticing that his exam answers ""(bore) little resemblance to the questions"" to detect whether the college senior had tapped artificial intelligence to give his take-home midterm exam a boost, according to school records provided to USA TODAY by Quarterman.\n\nThe professor was right, according to the software.\n\nShe issued him a failing grade and a referral to the University of California, Davis\' Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs for academic dishonesty in response.\n\nQuarterman denied he had any help from AI, but was asked to speak with the university\'s honor court in an experience he said caused him to have ""full-blown panic attacks."" He was eventually cleared of the accusation.\n\nHigher education officials across the nation are struggling to address how to uncover cheating and avoid making false accusations of cheating as students more frequently use AI for their assignments and AI-driven detection software proliferates.\n\nMany companies developing plagiarism detection software claim they can detect when students use AI to complete coursework while also conceding that they are sometimes incorrect.\n\nEducation technology experts said educators should be cautious of the quickly evolving nature of cheating detection software.\n\nIt would be wise for universities to steer clear of rising these cases to disciplinary action right now, said Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education. Instead, educators can ask a student to show their work before accusing someone of using AI for an assignment.\n\n""If universities think they\'re going to try to catch it in the act, they\'re going to be overwhelmed with mediation,"" he said. ""But we should implement guidelines: How are we citing information that comes from AI?""\n\nIn another publicized case, a Washington Post technology columnist found that Turnitin\'s new AI detection too falsely found several papers written by California high schoolers to be fabricated.\n\nMelissa Lutz Blouin, a UC Davis spokeswoman, said school officials are helping professors ""understand how AI tools can support student learning, as well as their potential misuse."" Stacy Fahrenthold, the professor who questioned Quarterman declined to comment on the case, claiming restrictions due to student privacy laws.\n\nChatGPT in the classroom:Here\'s what teachers and students are saying\n\nTo appeal his professor\'s accusations to university officials, Quarterman shared a Google document history of his exam writing that showed proof he didn\'t use AI and a slew of research on the fallibility of GPTZero and other AI detection tools, according to school records.\n\nIn a March 16 letter to the university appealing the professor\'s accusation – provided to USA TODAY by Quarterman\'s father – the student said that in his professor\'s feedback on his exam, Fahrenthold wrote in late February: ""William, unfortunately it appears as though this exam is plagiarized. The answer to Q3, in particular, is drawn from ChatGPT or similar AI software, and consequently, drawn from a variety of internet sources without attribution or citation. The consequences for submitting plagiarized work in this course is a grade of 0/20, and a citation to OSSJA for the issue of academic integrity.""\n\nAbout a month after the accusation, the university on March 24 dropped its case against Quarterman. In a separate letter provided to USA TODAY by Quarterman\'s father, Marilyn Derby, an associate director with the University\'s Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs, wrote to Quarterman: ""After talking with you, talking with your instructor, and doing my own research into indicators of AI-generated text, I believe you most likely wrote the text you submitted for your midterm. In fact, we have no reliable evidence to the contrary.""\n\nDerby said the university is reviewing several reports of a similar kind.\n\n""At the time your instructor submitted the report, we were just beginning our learning process of how to differentiate AI-generated text from human-generated text. We had a number of professors who submitted reports based on the output of GPTZero. As we learned of the fallibility of these tools, we shared information with instructors,"" she wrote. ""It\'s clear that it will be an ongoing challenge to stay current with the implications of this technology.""\n\nThe university is advising professors to use ""a variety of tools, along with our own analysis of the student\'s work, to reach a preponderance of evidence rather than relying on a single tool,"" and will be evaluating Turnitin AI detection\'s reliability, said Lutz Blouin.\n\nQuarterman and his family have become activists against schools using AI detection to find alleged cheaters. Quarterman\'s sister has compiled a hefty database of written works passed through several AI detection platforms, many showing false positives.\n\n""Obviously, there\'s a broader issue here,"" said his father, John Quarterman.\n\nThe creators behind AI detection tools developed by companies including OpenAI, TurnItIn and GPTZero, have warned educators about the potential inaccuracies of the software.\n\n""We really don\'t want anyone making definitive academic decisions out of our detector,"" said Edward Tian, creator of AI detection tool GPTZero. ""The nature of AI-generated content is changing constantly.""\n\nTian said GPTZero is pivoting from its former artificial intelligence detection model and its next version will not be detecting AI, ""but highlighting what\'s most human.""\n\nOpenAI also warned users its AI detection tool isn\'t fully reliable when the company first released it in late January.\n\nTurnitin\'s Chief Product Officer Annie Chechitelli also advised the 10,700 colleges and universities and 2.1 million educators who have access to the company\'s AI writing detection capability through existing licenses to be aware of its drawbacks.\n\nSince the false positive rate is not zero, educators should use ""their professional judgment, knowledge of your students, and the specific context surrounding the assignment,"" before outright accusing a student of cheating, Chechitelli wrote in a March blog post.\n\nOpenAI launched a second tool:To complement ChatGPT – and help teachers detect cheating\n\nEducation technology experts are adamant that schools need to embrace AI. And educators should learn to work with it rather than banning or fearing it especially as it quickly evolves, they told USA TODAY.\n\nNot your parents\' Google:Why universities should embrace, not fear, ChatGPT and AI\n\nMany schools already have codes of conduct that prohibit cheating and plagiarism. Another way schools can create further boundaries around the use of AI is by creating digital contracts for students to sign so they are aware of proper usage, Culatta said.\n\nAnd, Culatta added, schools and educators could also develop policies around citing AI when appropriate, make assessments more rigorous to avoid possibilities of plagiarism and determine the right questions to ask when a student is suspected of cheating.\n\n\'This shouldn\'t be a surprise\':The education community shares mixed reactions to ChatGPT\n\nLooking back, Quarterman said students should use Google documents to write their assignments like he did, or another word processor that tracks written work for evidence in case they end up in the same situation as him.\n\n""Be ready to be accused of and being fingered as using AI,"" he said.\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

"Singapore says unidentified people boarded tanker off Ivory Coast A Singapore-registered oil tanker has been boarded by ""unidentified persons"" about 300 nautical miles (555km) off Ivory Coast in the Gulf of Guinea, the city-state\'s port authority said.\n\nThe Gulf of Guinea was long known as a hotspot for global piracy, with insurance firm Beazley offering the ""Gulf of Guinea Piracy Plus"", a bespoke insurance plan for maritime crew travelling through the area. The maritime zone covers 11,000sq km (4,247sq miles) and stretches from Angola to Senegal.\n\nBut piracy incidents have dwindled since 2021 as national authorities stepped up security efforts, helped by foreign naval ships, the United Nations says.\n\nThe tanker Success 9 had 20 crew members of various nationalities on board including one Singaporean when it ""was boarded by unidentified persons"" on Monday, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the MPA said it was working closely with the ship owner, Monrovian maritime rescue officials and the city-state\'s Changi command and control centre to monitor the situation and provide assistance.\n\nIt gave no further details of the incident, such as the nationalities of the rest of the crew.\n\nHai Soon Group, a Singapore-registered company that owns the tanker, declined immediate comment, saying it awaited further updates.\n\nThe tanker has been operating in the West African zone for the past 60 days, Refinitiv ship-tracking data showed.\n\nIts last shipping fixture record showed it was carrying diesel, according to Vortexa data.\n\nA patrol boat sent out to rescue the tanker had been unable to locate it as its beacon had been turned off, an Ivorian security source involved in the matter said.\n\n""We think it\'s an act of piracy because the modus operandi is the same,"" the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters news agency, adding, ""We have sought external help from Spain and from Europe.""\n\nPirates hijacked a Danish-owned ship off the Republic of Congo last month and kidnapped some of the crew before abandoning the vessel. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/singapore-says-unidentified-people-boarded-tanker-off-ivory-coast"

"Decoder Ring Is Back For a Spring Season Slate\'s podcast Decoder Ring is back for a spring season with a brand new collection of cultural mysteries that will send you down the rabbit hole. On each episode, host Willa Paskin takes on a different question, object, or habit; examines its history; and tries to understand what it means and why it matters. This season starts Wednesday with a Cold War caper.\n\nAs Sam Sanders told Vulture, ""Paskin does this wonderful thing where she\'ll spin these yarns about whatever--method acting, this, that--and then she gets to the end and you realize she\'s giving you the thesis of her dissertation. She\'ll nail this thing that makes you reconsider the world.""\n\nNew episodes of Decoder Ring drop every week on Wednesday. This season includes investigations into one of the most quietly powerful forces in American life today--the parking spot--and how the Tooth Fairy has persisted for so long with relatively little commercialization.\n\nThe first mystery is a two-parter, exploring the fascinating story behind a bizarre anecdote from Columbo star Peter Falk. He once told David Letterman that in the middle of the Cold War, he was asked by the Romanian ambassador and the U.S. State Department to record a special message for Romanian state television.

"China is home to one of the world's biggest luxury markets, and it's starting to make a comeback after the country's 3-year COVID lockdowns After a blip in 2022, the Chinese luxury and consumer discretionary goods sectors have been showing early signs of recovery.\n\nIn terms of luxury and high-end consumption, ""we\'re seeing quite strong recovery,"" Bank of America\'s chief China equity strategist, Winnie Wu, told CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nChina is an important luxury consumer. In a report released in February 2020, consulting firm Bain & Co. said it expected Chinese consumers to account for almost half -- that\'s 46% -- of the global luxury market by 2025, up from around 35% in 2019.\n\nBut thanks to years of COVID-19 lockdowns, China\'s personal luxury sales fell by 10% year on year in 2022 to 425 billion yuan, or $5.2 billion, per Nikkei. It marked the end a five-year run of exponential growth, according to a separate Bain & Co. report released on February 7.\n\nEven foot traffic at Chinese malls dropped 30% to 35% in 2022, Nikkei reported in February.\n\nHowever, Wu\'s comments echoed Bain\'s positive outlook for China\'s luxury market.\n\n""Luxury consumption will recover as Covid subsides, mall traffic improves, and consumer sentiment rebounds. We expect to see 2021 sales levels sometime between the first and second half of 2023,"" Weiwei Xing, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain & Company, said in the consultancy\'s February report.\n\nThis cheery forecast for the luxury market does not extend to the rest of the Chinese economy.\n\nChina\'s consumer price index, or CPI -- the monthly change in prices paid by consumers -- showed bleak data for March.\n\nThe index rose by just 0.7% year-on-year, its slowest pace since September 2021 and weaker than the 1.5% growth seen in March 2022, according to data released Tuesday by China\'s National Bureau of Statistics. The month\'s CPI growth also missed expectations of the 1% growth projected by analysts polled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt could be the reason Bank of America\'s Wu told CNBC that strong recovery across China\'s consumer sector has not yet been seen.\n\n""So far we\'re seeing mixed signals. Retail sales is not good enough,"" she said. https://www.businessinsider.com/china-luxury-market-comeback-pandemic-bofa-2023-4"
"A gleefully nostalgic guide to the '90s and '00s music in 'Beef' Aside from already being one of the best shows of the year, A24 and Netflix\'s Beef boasts enough \'90s and \'00s needle drops to power an iMac G3. For millennials who were there, it\'s easy to imagine the soundtrack to showrunner Lee Sung Jin\'s series being scrawled in marker on a mix CD, one I\'d probably have made a completely horrendous custom jewel case sleeve for on Microsoft Paint.\n\nLee worked with music supervisor Tiffany Anders for Beef, following her excellent work on PEN15 and Reservation Dogs, to find tracks to underscore moments of poignancy, hilarity, or deep nostalgia. Paired harmoniously with Beef\'s score, composed by producer Bobby Krlic, aka The Haxan Cloak, every track picked by Lee and Anders radiates 1990s and 2000s energy. Whether a diegetic performance of Incubus\' ""Drive"" by Danny Cho (yep, that\'s Steven Yeun playing live) or Hoobstank\'s ""The Reason"" underscoring a crucial exchange between Danny and Amy Lau (Ali Wong), every episode has a throwback treat. Maybe it\'s an A24 thing -- Everything Everywhere All at Once wielded Nine Days\' ""Absolutely (Story of a Girl)"" as a key theme -- or maybe it\'s riding the nostalgic wave of \'90s/\'00s music throwbacks fueling pop culture. But it all truly works in Beef.\n\n""That\'s all stuff I listened to when I was growing up,"" Lee tells Mashable. ""When I initially pitched the show back in 2019, it felt like such a novel idea. I was like, \'It\'s gonna be all \'90s and early \'00s. No one\'s done it before!\' Now, that\'s the zeitgeist. But I also feel like the characters are kind of trapped in the past. They\'re very stunted in their spiritual and mental evolutions, so a lot of the issues they\'re dealing with, I felt were very prominent in their adolescence, at least, and also in mine.\n\n""There\'s something about the songs from that era that feel so Beef, for lack of a better word. Especially in the first half, we really wanted to pick songs that maybe back in the day didn\'t get their proper shine; not necessarily on all the critics\' lists back in 2000. But if we were all being honest, they\'re bangers, they\'re timeless, and they\'re really great. We wanted to bring back some songs that maybe didn\'t get their proper due.""\n\nHere\'s a look at all the \'90s and \'00s needle drops in Beef, and why they work so well.\n\nI\'m not a peeeeerfect peeeeeersooooooon, and neither is Danny or Amy. Episode 1 ends with the ultimate belter ballad, Hoobastank\'s 2003 ""The Reason"" -- a song you\'d better commit to if you pick it at karaoke. This is the type of song you would scream in your car at the traffic lights, road rage or not, valiantly attempting to hit anywhere near lead singer Doug Robb\'s high notes. You might have heard the track most recently going viral on TikTok through the #NotAPerfectPerson(Opens in a new tab) challenge, which saw users posting about questionable life choices using the song -- and which good sport Robb himself joined in on(Opens in a new tab).\n\nA steadily climbing ballad of self-analysis and starting over new, the track preaches vulnerability and regret while cutting yourself some slack. So, yeah, it\'s the perfect track to introduce Danny Cho and Amy Lau, two people who smile through gritted teeth before becoming their most unhinged, selfish selves through their toxic, competitive, obsessive connection to each other. Watching Amy screaming ""What the fuck!?"" and chasing a gleeful Danny down her street after he pisses all over her bathroom, as Hoobastank\'s uplifting mega hit swells, is one of the series\' best moments.\n\nFrom Collective Soul\'s eyebrow raise of a 1993 debut album title, Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid, the alt rock band\'s most popular song, ""Shine,"" plays in episode 2 when Danny and his brother Paul (Young Mazino) are working out and posting thirst traps by the pool. In the scene, Danny suggests starting a new contracting business together, seemingly making peace -- though it may serve Danny\'s interests more than Paul\'s. Danny reflects on his ex from the late \'00s, Veronica, with Collective Soul playing in the background to boost this nostalgia. And though the band wasn\'t a religious group, the heavenly references in the lyrics match both Danny\'s church group tank top and his vocalised intentions to return to the congregation.\n\nBeginning in a scene of Amy and her husband George (Joseph Lee) making up after their gallery argument, Tori Amos\' ""Cornflake Girl"" ends episode 2 as Danny drives to Amy\'s house in his vandalised truck holding a hammer and ready to do…something. A tale of friendship turned toxic, Amos\' 1994 track from her second album Under the Pink is extremely fitting for Beef -- you can\'t get a more openly venomous relationship than Danny and Amy\'s, but Amy and George\'s connection may be subtly souring. You might have heard this one recently in another context, in Season 2 of fellow needle-dropper Yellowjackets, ending episode 1 right before Shauna decides to have a little snack on Jackie\'s ear.\n\nDid you know Steven Yeun can sing? You bet he can. Joining the Living Glory Church group for a singalong of Incubus\' 2000 breakthrough single, ""Drive,\'\' Yeun sings live as Danny while playing guitar. It\'s the same episode where Danny breaks down in the same church to a performance by the church\'s band led by Edwin (Justin H. Min). Considering that Beef\'s entire charade begins with a road rage incident and veers chaotically into existential dread, Incubus\' lyrics are pretty fitting: ""It\'s driven me before and seems to have a vague / Haunting mass appeal / But lately I\'m beginning to find that I / Should be the one behind the wheel."" Yeun spoke about his connection to singing in the Korean Christian church on Netflix\'s podcast Skip Intro(Opens in a new tab), saying, ""I used to lead praise at church."" Later in the series, Yeun has another moment doing just this, as Danny fronts the band singing ""Amazing Grace.""\n\nSomeone crack open a shitty beer on the way to the coast, because Sugar Ray and Super Cat\'s ""Fly"" is next. Playing to open episode 4, this 1997 radio favourite scores the awkward tension of Amy driving Paul home from their first real meeting as each other. All around the world statues crumble for Paul, as he simultaneously tries his flirt on while pitching his semi-valet startup, Portable Parking, while Sugar Ray\'s Mark McGrath sings about bouncy, breezy love and grieving one\'s mother. It\'s got it all!\n\nIf you\'re going to get your brother and your cousin drunk so you can sneak off to Las Vegas to see your crush, try shots of the nearest crappy liquor toasted to Limp Bizkit\'s ""Nookie."" The pretty gross, misogynistic lead single from 1999\'s Significant Other was the group\'s first big hit, and goes perfectly with Danny and Isaac\'s (David Choe) plunge into passing out as Paul steals the truck. Too easy.\n\nThe perfectly hazy, lazy track for Amy and Paul\'s Las Vegas hotel room silliness, Morphine\'s 1993 track ""Cure for Pain,"" appears in episode 4. The lyrics are quite literal for the scene, ""Someday there\'ll be a cure for pain / That\'s the day I throw my drugs away,"" but accompanied by Dana Colley\'s growling baritone saxophone, it creates a comforting space for both characters to let loose a little. Smoking weed, dropping Skittles in Coca-Cola, jumping on the bed, dancing in the dark, and eating mangosteen sprawled on the floor, it\'s the first time we\'ve actually seen Amy have fun in Beef, and it\'s incredibly wholesome. ""It was really nice to do what I want for once,"" she says.\n\nHands down, it\'s one of the best moments in Amy and Danny\'s rivalry for the whole series, scored with the brattiest song out. Ending episode 4, The Offspring\'s 1994 banger ""Self Esteem"" blares through the silent service halls of the Las Vegas casino as Danny is caught by security after crashing Amy\'s panel. Raising one finger and wagging it at his losing predicament, Amy truly enjoys this moment of victory. If she could pick a track to go with this smug win, it would probably be this very song.\n\nThe angst is real at the end of episode 5, when George\'s mum Fumi (Patti Yasutake) surprises Isaac\'s trespassing mates in Amy\'s house, leading to her falling down the stairs. The track from 2005\'s Hypnotize is poignant mainly for how Lee develops Fumi\'s character in this episode, experiencing severe loneliness and isolation from her family and friends, despite her outward confidence and judgmental nature. ""Such a lonely day, and it\'s mine / The most loneliest day of my life / Such a lonely day should be banned / It\'s a day that I can\'t stand,"" reflects lead singer Serj Tankian as we\'re not quite sure whether or not Fumi is alive or not.\n\nIn what might be the funniest needle drop in the series, episode 6 sees Paula Cole\'s 1996 Dawson\'s Creek theme song cannonball the characters into romantic will-they-won\'t-they nostalgia. Simmering beneath the scene as George and Mia (Mia Serafino) all but confirm their attraction to one another, Cole\'s instantly recognisable track plays on the radio in the car as they decide to call it. Lee and Anders could have picked any track for this scene, and choosing delicious, reliable cheese, they allow George and Mia to earnestly ask themselves, ""Will it be yes, or will it be sorry?""\n\nUnderscoring the church group\'s casual basketball league, which we already know Edwin takes rather seriously, comes Bush\'s 1994 track ""Machinehead."" Marked by the song\'s ""Breathe in, breathe out,"" lyrics, the scene is all high fives, tank tops, and sweaty bravado, as Danny and Paul bond in victory while Edwin angrily scorns his own performance on the court.\n\nLook, I\'m already unsteady thinking about this episode ending and this song. Keane\'s absolutely shameless pop heartbreaker from 2004, ""Somewhere Only We Know,"" punches you in the heart in episode 7, as Amy\'s world finally collapses thanks to Paul\'s reactive confession to George. Rushing home to explain, Amy finds her house empty, family gone, as Paul happily meets his own family in a restaurant, completely unscathed. It\'s the deepest cut yet for Amy, as is the next scene for Danny, arriving at the beautiful home he\'s built for his mother, father, and brother tragically burning to the ground. I\'m going to need an entire Burger King meal to process this one, despite how many times I\'ve heard this behind TikTok videos.\n\nDanny is absolutely spiraling, having knocked out George and accidentally kidnapped Amy\'s daughter Junie in episode 8 as Grant Lee Buffalo\'s early \'90s song ""Mockingbirds"" plays. Lead singer Grant Lee Phillips told American Songwriter(Opens in a new tab) he wrote this song after losing his home in the 1994 Northridge earthquake: ""Pick the cataclysm of your choice. That\'s where it\'s coming from. Although, when you stop and consider lyrics like \'Devastation, at last, finally we meet,\' that is indeed very much the feeling one had as they walked out into the rubble of what was their home."" Yes, I am taking this as a giant reference to the emotional and literal rubble Danny and Amy are currently sifting through.\n\nAfter Amy\'s monologue about unconditional love fading, Björk\'s delicate, gentle 1997 moody masterpiece ""All Is Full of Love"" is the perfect accompaniment to the fallout of episode 9, when Danny and Amy feel more isolated, helpless, and frustratingly connected than ever before. The Icelandic icon repeating the words ""You\'ll be given love / You\'ll be taken care of / You\'ll be given love / You have to trust it,"" almost feels like Lee and Anders giving the protagonists a much needed cuddle in the midst of an absolute shitstorm. The shocking, violent run of the episode leads Amy and Danny quite literally to veer off the road together (that shot), finding themselves with no one but each other in the darkness.\n\nEnding the final episode of the series with The Smashing Pumpkins\' 1993 track ""Mayonaise"" is a feat that wraps up the entire soundtrack in a deeply moving package. Closing that stunner of a finale, as Amy and Danny cling to each other for literal dear life, lead singer Billy Corgan sings, ""We\'ll try and ease the pain / But somehow, we\'ll feel the same / Well, no one knows / Where our secrets go."" It\'s the perfect anthem for our protagonists.\n\nRolling Stone(Opens in a new tab) explains the song\'s title has a fittingly vague and fact-fluctuating history:\n\n""In 1996, an exasperated Corgan said during an online chat in Dublin, \'You know how I got the title \'Mayonaise\'? I looked in my refrigerator.\' He also told a Colombian radio station that it\'s actually a phonetic way of writing \'my own eyes.\' A 1996 interview with KROQ is probably the closest we\'ll get to a real insight on the title. \'Sometimes you just gotta open up your brain and just see what comes in,\' he said.""\n\nThat last one?

"Democratic Convention Gives Chicago, Staggered by Pandemic, a Chance to Shine The surprise mayoral triumph last week of a young, untested liberal, Brandon Johnson, has brought with it a nervous excitement -- the hope of a fresh face but the worry that comes with inexperience. Still, with the sun out, temperatures in the 70s and the summer festival season on its way, Chicagoans were already feeling optimistic.\n\n""It gives us an opportunity to feature the best of the best, in a space where there is a lot of energy and a lot of hope,"" said Representative Delia Ramirez, a progressive in her first term in Congress from Chicago\'s near northwest side. ""This is a truly new day, with a brand-new mayor-elect, the youngest, most progressive, most diverse City Council ever, our first Latina in Congress -- it\'s a magical place and it\'s ready.""\n\nChicago beat out its biggest competitor, Atlanta, with three basic appeals. It\'s in a state with a Democratic governor, J.B. Pritzker, who also happens to be a billionaire with deep and wide-open pockets. It has powerful unions who pressed the pro-labor occupant of the White House to choose a city with unionized hotels, unionized convention and entertainment sites and unionized restaurants.

"Energy services firm Petrofac expects bigger annual loss Petrofac has warned it expects to make a larger annual loss after a large-scale portfolio review unveiled higher costs.\n\nThe energy services group told investors on Wednesday that it was recognising a further $140million to $160million cut in its earnings before interest and tax for the last financial year.\n\nPetrofac now anticipates reporting a full-year loss of between $150million to $170million, primarily as a result of a loss of up to $260million in its engineering and construction business.\n\nIt said the extra charges related to 'incremental project costs', and reflected a 'cautious view' of the quantity and timing of the recognition of certain revenue claims.\n\nOutlook: Petrofac told investors on Wednesday that it was recognising a further $140million to $160million cut in its earnings before interest and tax for the last financial year\n\nPetrofac has also recorded substantial costs connected with operational changes on the Thai Oil Clean Fuels project, as well as activities on other legacy contracts.\n\nAround half the increased costs are predicted to be paid this year, with the rest settled over the course of 2024 and 2025.\n\nPetrofac shares had plunged by 15 per cent to 61.75p in early trading following the update, making it the second-worst performer on the FTSE All-Share Index.\n\nOver the past three years, the stock has lost approximately two-thirds of its value.\n\n'Petrofac's focus is on completing legacy contracts as quickly, efficiently and safely as possible,' said newly-appointed chief executive Tareq Kawash.\n\n'We are taking steps to ensure the financial strength of the business by unlocking working capital and, where appropriate, balancing long-term value against near-term liquidity.\n\n'Although we are disappointed to announce additional costs on these legacy contracts, in particular the Thai Oil Clean Fuels project, ongoing collaboration with clients and partners will de-risk future delivery.'\n\nKawash joined Petrofac at the start of April, replacing Sami Iskander, who stood down following a turbulent three years in charge in order to 'pursue other interests.'\n\nIskander's tenure included Petrofac receiving a £70million penalty from the Serious Fraud Office in October 2021 for failing to prevent former senior executives from paying or offering bribes across Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to secure contracts.\n\nThe controversy impeded the firm's ability to secure work across the Middle East, with the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) temporarily banning the group from bidding for new contracts.\n\nLast year, though, ADNOC granted the business two significant deals: a two-year extension on a field maintenance services contract and a brownfield engineering, procurement and construction agreement.\n\nShortly before Iskander's departure, Petrofac was jointly awarded an £11.4billion offshore-wind framework agreement with Hitachi Energy by the electricity grid operator TenneT. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-11963665/Energy-services-firm-Petrofac-expects-bigger-annual-loss.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"White House Designates Animal Sedative as an 'Emerging Drug Threat' According to a 2018 directive from Congress that established the emerging threat designation, the administration must now lay out plans within 90 days to coordinate a national response to xylazine. That could include creating protocols for treatment, withdrawal and wound care therapies, expanding testing for the drug\'s presence and scheduling it as a controlled substance, which would give federal law enforcement agents authority to pursue its illicit use.\n\nDevastating losses. Drug overdose deaths, largely caused by the synthetic opioid drug fentanyl, reached record highs in the United States in 2021. Here\'s what you should know to keep your loved ones safe:\n\nUnderstand fentanyl\'s effects. Fentanyl is a potent and fast-acting drug, two qualities that also make it highly addictive. A small quantity goes a long way, so it\'s easy to suffer an overdose. With fentanyl, there is only a short window of time to intervene and save a person\'s life during an overdose.\n\nStick to licensed pharmacies. Prescription drugs sold online or by unlicensed dealers marketed as OxyContin, Vicodin and Xanax are often laced with fentanyl. Only take pills that were prescribed by your doctor and came from a licensed pharmacy.\n\nTalk to your loved ones. The best way to prevent fentanyl use is to educate your loved ones, including teens, about it. Explain what fentanyl is and that it can be found in pills bought online or from friends. Aim to establish an ongoing dialogue in short spurts rather than one long, formal conversation.\n\nLearn how to spot an overdose. When someone overdoses from fentanyl, breathing slows and their skin often turns a bluish hue. If you think someone is overdosing, call 911 right away.\n\nBuy naloxone. If you\'re concerned that a loved one could be exposed to fentanyl, you may want to buy naloxone. The medicine can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose and is often available at pharmacies without a prescription. Narcan, the nasal spray version of naloxone, has received F.D.A. approval to be sold over the counter and should be widely available by late summer.\n\nDr. Gupta said that xylazine withdrawal could lead to symptoms so intense -- such as migraines, double vision and body-rattling anxiety -- ""that persons may leave medical treatment, including drug treatment, against medical advice.""\n\nBut it is sought out by dealers and drug users because it is relatively cheap, with its own addictive properties, whether consumed on its own or mixed with opioids or even amphetamines. Like fentanyl, xylazine first appeared as an adulterant in the illicit drug supply in the Northeast, predominantly in Philadelphia, and then rapidly spread west and south. Citing data compiled by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Justice, Dr. Gupta noted that in the two-year period from 2020 through 2021, detection of xylazine in forensic labs grew 112 percent in the West and 193 percent in the South.\n\nCurrently, the supplies of xylazine are thought to come from China and possibly Mexico, India and Russia, but they could also be coming from some domestic manufacturers who sell to veterinarians.\n\nWednesday\'s announcement follows a crescendo of recent alerts from local health authorities and warnings from other federal agencies. In a xylazine alert in March, the D.E.A. said it had detected the drug in 23 percent of confiscatedfentanyl samples in 48 states in 2022. Last November, the Food and Drug Administration, which approved xylazine decades ago for veterinary procedures, issued a nationwide warning to health care providers, and in February, it announced it would monitor imported xylazine for illegal diversion. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/health/tranq-dope-xylazine.html"

"As U.S. Tries to Isolate China, German Companies Move Closer The Biden administration has pledged to make the United States more competitive with China by expanding American infrastructure and manufacturing, rather than negotiating new trade deals. German lawmakers and business leaders have made clear that their relationship with China is more nuanced: open to vigorous trade while trying to diversify into other Asian markets.\n\nIt is a policy being developed after a bruising year when Russia shut down natural gas shipments to Germany, a move that reminded lawmakers of the costs of relying on autocratic nations for materials essential to its industrial backbone. In the case of China, a big problem is Germany's dependence on its imports.\n\nGermany depends on China to provide essential technology products, including mobile phones and LEDs, as well as raw materials, including lithium and rare earth elements. These are critical to Germany's plans to make a transition to cleaner energy and transportation.\n\nSuch a reliance must be carefully considered as Germany thinks strategically about its future dealings with China, said Katrin Kamin, a director of the Kiel Initiative in Geopolitics and Economics. Reducing its ties anytime soon is not a reasonable option. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/world/europe/germany-china-trade.html"
"A Problem for Ukraine: Countries Like Brazil Won't Sell It Arms It hurts Ukraine because it becomes overly dependent on NATO supplies, which are donated, but are extremely expensive to maintain, because they come from rich countries that own and make extremely sophisticated weapons,"" said Sandro Teixeira Moita, a military strategy professor at the Brazilian Army Command and Staff College. ""The global south countries have weapons systems that are more suited to their realities.""\n\nBrazil says its guiding principle of foreign policy has long been to remain a friend to all.\n\nStill, the country has proved willing to sell to other warring nations. Since the beginning of the Yemeni War in 2014, Brazil has supplied Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with more than 21,000 tons of arms and ammunition worth $680 million, including internationally condemned cluster munitions, according to trade data.\n\nBrazil, one of the world\'s largest food producers, also relies on Russia for a quarter of its fertilizers. In 2022, as Russia attacked Ukraine, Brazil purchased more than 8.8 million tons of Russian fertilizer, down from 10.2 million in 2021. Brazil is the leading buyer of Russian fertilizers and Russia the top supplier for Brazilian farmers.\n\nWhat we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information?

Together, these proposals would avoid nearly 10 billion tons of CO2 emissions, equivalent to more than twice the total U.S. CO2 emissions in 2022, while saving thousands of dollars over the lives of the vehicles meeting these new standards and reduce America\'s reliance on approximately 20 billion barrels of oil imports.\n\n""By proposing the most ambitious pollution standards ever for cars and trucks, we are delivering on the Biden-Harris Administration\'s promise to protect people and the planet, securing critical reductions in dangerous air and climate pollution and ensuring significant economic benefits like lower fuel and maintenance costs for families,"" said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. ""These ambitious standards are readily achievable thanks to President Biden\'s Investing in America agenda, which is already driving historic progress to build more American-made electric cars and secure America\'s global competitiveness.""\n\nSince President Biden took office, the number of EV sales has tripled while the number of available models has doubled. There are over 130,000 public chargers across the country – a 40% increase over 2020. The private sector has also committed more than $120 billion in domestic EV and battery investments since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. The new standards proposed today reflect the advancements and investments in clean vehicle manufacturing, which have been accelerated by President Biden\'s Investing in America agenda and complement the ongoing transition in the market towards cleaner vehicles.\n\nThe new proposed emissions standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles for model year (MY) 2027 and beyond would significantly reduce climate and other harmful air pollution, unlocking significant benefits for public health, especially in communities that have borne the greatest burden of poor air quality. At the same time, the proposed standards would lower maintenance costs and deliver significant fuel savings for drivers and truck operators.\n\nLight- and Medium-Duty Vehicle Proposed Standards\n\nThe first set of proposed standards announced today, the ""Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium Duty Vehicles,"" builds on EPA\'s existing emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks for MYs 2023 through 2026. The proposal retains the proven regulatory design of previous EPA standards for light-duty vehicles, but leverages advances in clean car technology to further reduce both climate pollution and smog- and soot-forming emissions.\n\nBetween 2027 and 2055, the total projected net benefits of the light- and medium-duty proposal range from $850 billion to $1.6 trillion. The proposal is expected to avoid 7.3 billion tons of CO2 emissions through 2055, equivalent to eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions from the entire current U.S. transportation sector for four years and would also deliver significant health benefits by reducing fine particulate matter that can cause premature death, heart attacks, respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, aggravated asthma, and decreased lung function. EPA analysis shows that severe health impacts related to particulate matter exposure will also be reduced – including lung disorders (including cancer), heart disease, and premature mortality.\n\nEPA\'s proposal considers a broad suite of available emission control technologies, and the standards are designed to allow manufacturers to meet the performance-based standards however works best for their vehicle fleets. EPA projects that for the industry as a whole, the standards are expected to drive widespread use of filters to reduce gasoline particulate matter emissions and spur greater deployment of CO2-reducing technologies for gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nThe proposed standards are also projected to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. Depending on the compliance pathways manufacturers select to meet the standards, EPA projects that EVs could account for 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales and 46% of new medium-duty vehicle sales in MY 2032. The proposed MY 2032 light-duty standards are projected to result in a 56% reduction in projected fleet average greenhouse gas emissions target levels compared to the existing MY 2026 standards. The proposed MY 2032 medium-duty vehicle standards would result in a 44% reduction compared to MY 2026 standards.\n\nHeavy-duty Truck Proposed Standards\n\nThe second set of proposed standards announced today, the ""Greenhouse Gas Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles - Phase 3,"" would apply to heavy-duty vocational vehicles (such as delivery trucks, refuse haulers or dump trucks, public utility trucks, transit, shuttle, school buses) and trucks typically used to haul freight. These standards would complement the criteria pollutant standards for MY 2027 and beyond heavy-duty vehicles that EPA finalized in December 2022 and represent the third phase of EPA\'s Clean Trucks Plan.\n\nThese ""Phase 3"" greenhouse gas standards maintain the flexible structure that EPA previously designed through a robust stakeholder engagement process to reflect the diverse nature of the heavy-duty industry. Like the light- and medium-duty proposal, the heavy-duty proposal uses performance-based standards that enable manufacturers to achieve compliance efficiently based on the composition of their fleets.\n\nThe projected net benefits of the heavy-duty proposal range from $180 billion to $320 billion. The proposal is projected to avoid 1.8 billion tons of CO2 through 2055, equivalent to eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions from the entire current U.S. transportation sector for an entire year, and deliver additional health benefits by reducing other pollutants from these vehicles. The standards would result in improved air quality nationwide, and those who live near major roadways and are disproportionately exposed to vehicle pollution and heavy-duty activity, which often includes low-income populations and communities of color, would benefit most directly.\n\nInvesting in America\'s Clean Transportation Future\n\nThe proposed standards align with commitments made by automakers and U.S. states as they plan to accelerate clean vehicle technologies in the light- and medium-duty fleets in the next 10 to 15 years. Car and truck companies are moving to include electric vehicles as an integral and growing part of current and future product lines, leading to an increasing diversity of clean vehicles for consumers.\n\nThese developments are bolstered by President Biden\'s investments in America, which provide unprecedented resources to support the development and market for clean vehicle technologies and associated infrastructure and represent significant investment in expanding the manufacture, sale, and use of zero-emission vehicles. As these technologies advance, battery costs continue to decline and consumer interest in electric vehicles continues to grow. President Biden\'s legislative accomplishments are also supporting critical generation of clean electricity and production of clean hydrogen needed to decarbonize transportation. EPA considered this rapid innovation in its assessment that tighter emissions standards are feasible.\n\nEPA\'s proposals are informed by robust and inclusive stakeholder engagement with industry, labor, advocates, and community leaders. EPA\'s proposals will be published in the Federal Register and available for public review and comment, and the agency will continue to engage with the public and all interested stakeholders as part of the regulatory development process.\n\nProposed Rule: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles – Phase 3\n\nProposed Rule: Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles\n\nMore information on environmental justice and transportation. https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-proposes-strongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-and"
"Myanmar Military Kills More Than 100 People In A Single Attack On April 11, 2023, the Myanmar military is said to have killed at least 100 people in one of the deadliest airstrikes in the ongoing civil war. The attack targeted a village in the north-western Sagaing region. Witnesses report that among those killed were many women and children. The numbers of those killed are yet to be confirmed as the bodies are being collected. Reportedly, the military attacked the village as hundreds of people gathered in Pazigyi Village to celebrate the opening of a local administration office, where tea and food were offered. The opening coincided with the start of the Thingyan New Year celebrations. Just before 8 AM, a junta aircraft bombed the village. Eyewitnesses reported that this was followed by a Mi35 helicopter circling and firing on the village minutes later.\n\nProtesters hold banners and shout slogans while marching past Myanmar military soldiers who arrived ... [ ] to guard the Central Bank overnight on February 15, 2021 in Yangon, Myanmar. (Photo credit: by Hkun Lat/Getty Images)\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the attack, called for the protection of civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and for those responsible to be held accountable. U.N. Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, condemned the attack stating that ""It appears schoolchildren performing dances, as well as other civilians, attending an opening ceremony at the hall in Pazi Gyi village, Kanbalu Township were among the victims. A helicopter gunship then reportedly fired on those fleeing the hall."" He repeated his concerns that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the military and its affiliated militias are responsible for human rights violations and abuses which may constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nThe military has been resorting to air strikes against their opponents since they seized power in February 2021. On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military, the Tatmadaw, staged a coup and took over Myanmar. What followed can only be described as a brutal crackdown to suppress opposition to its rule, including mass killings, torture, and sexual violence. Thousands of people have been killed across Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021. The crackdown on human rights defenders and the opposition in the country was followed by an increase in arbitrary detentions and criminal proceedings, especially targeting protesters, journalists, lawyers, health workers, and political opposition. Many of them have been, and are currently being, denied their right to a fair trial as per international standards.\n\nArmed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) reported that between February 2021 and January 2023, the military was involved in at least 600 attacks. ACLED commented that in 2022, ""the military junta has used discriminate violence to target civilians accused of supporting anti-coup activities, as well as indiscriminate violence against civilians across the country. At the same time, the military has increased its use of airstrikes and shelling targeting civilians, continuing such actions into the new year."" ACLED further added that ""the military\'s increased procurement of combat aircraft from Russia and China in recent years has facilitated their growing reliance on airstrikes to quell opposition to their rule. Outside of Ukraine, the highest number of battles globally were recorded in Myanmar in 2022."" Looking into 2023, they commented that ""The military\'s refusal to relinquish power and the severe violence they continue to direct at civilian populations to keep that power means they are unlikely to adhere to any promises of reform. With the military\'s ongoing targeting of those who resist its rule, 2023 will likely be a year of even further violence in Myanmar.""\n\nThe deadly attacks continue despite several calls from the international community to address the issue. For example, in December 2022, the U.N. Security Council called for the immediate end to all forms of violence in Myanmar and urged restraint, the de-escalation of tensions and the release of all prisoners, including President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. Unfortunately, four months later, there has been no palpable change. As long as the military is in power in Myanmar, violence will continue and civilians will continue to be targeted. The last two years of the military in power are the very evidence of that. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2023/04/12/myanmar-military-kills-more-than-100-people-in-a-single-attack/"
"US praises Yemen progress in call with Saudi crown prince Saudi Arabia\'s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has spoken with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in a phone call that mostly discussed the continuing peace talks in Yemen that have raised hopes of finally ending the years-long conflict there.\n\nThe call, in which Sullivan highlighted the ""remarkable progress"" in Yemen in the last year, was made late on Tuesday, the White House said in a statement.\n\nHe praised ""Saudi Arabia\'s extraordinary efforts to pursue a more comprehensive roadmap"" and ""offered full US support for those efforts"", according to the statement.\n\nSaudi and Omani delegations are currently holding talks with Houthi officials in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.\n\nThe negotiations could result in a deal within the next seven to 10 days, a nongovernmental official told The Associated Press news agency. A senior Biden administration official, however, told the agency that the negotiations are complex.\n\nYemen has been embroiled in conflict since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 after Houthi rebels, linked to Iran, overthrew the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2014. The United States militarily backed the Saudi campaign that pushed one of the most impoverished countries in the region towards a dire crisis.\n\nThe crisis turned into an all-out proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, with civilians caught in its crosshairs. The killing of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis, the displacement of millions and a continuing famine make it the world\'s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations.\n\nTo follow up on issues discussed during the call, Biden\'s special envoy for Yemen, Tim Lenderking, will head to Riyadh this week.\n\nMBS and Sullivan also discussed Saudi Arabia\'s renewed ties with Iran and Iran\'s nuclear programme, among other topics.\n\n""Mr Sullivan reaffirmed President [Joe] Biden\'s unwavering commitment to ensure Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon,"" the White House\'s statement said.\n\nSaudi and Iranian officials met this past week in Tehran to discuss the reopening of their diplomatic missions after a seven-year absence in a deal that was brokered by China. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/us-praises-yemen-progress-in-call-with-saudi-crown-prince"
"Biden plans to focus on economy in Belfast speech marking Good Friday Agreement anniversary  When President Joe Biden speaks here Wednesday to mark a quarter-century of the Good Friday Agreement, it won\'t be from the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly – currently suspended over a Brexit trade dispute – but from a new university campus downtown.\n\nHis choice of venue is a symbolic one. While decades of violence between Nationalists and Unionists has been mostly left to another era, the peace is fragile and the politics are broken – making Biden\'s speech to students as much about the future of this region as its bloody past.\n\nDeparting Washington on Tuesday, Biden described his goal in Northern Ireland bluntly: ensuring the US-brokered accord remains in place.\n\n""Keep the peace, that\'s the main thing,"" he said before boarding Air Force One. ""Keep your fingers crossed.""\n\nBiden\'s frank outlook for his one-night visit to Northern Ireland was a reflection of the tensions that remain 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. The agreement called for a power-sharing government between those who want to remain part of the United Kingdom and those who favor a united Ireland.\n\nWhile Biden was invited to speak from Stormont, the stately parliament building overlooking Belfast, he turned down the offer while the power-sharing arrangement remains mired in dysfunction. The regional government has operated only sporadically since it was formed and hasn\'t been in place for more than a year as the main unionist party resists new Brexit-related trade rules.\n\nBoth Biden and the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had once hoped those differences might be resolved by the time of Biden\'s visit this week. But they weren\'t, leaving one of the primary accomplishments of the Good Friday Agreement unfulfilled at just the moment the accord is being celebrated.\n\nBiden\'s aides worked around the disappointment by scheduling his speech at the new campus of Ulster University in Belfast, which cost millions of pounds to construct and can accommodate thousands of students – most of whom were born after the Good Friday Agreement was signed.\n\nFor them, the violence from The Troubles isn\'t even a distant memory, since they weren\'t around to experience it first-hand. Instead, it is economic opportunity that appears top of mind, particularly as Britain\'s exit from the European Union complicates trade relations in the region.\n\nBiden plans to focus heavily on the economy in his speech, and has appointed a special envoy to Northern Ireland, former US Rep. Joe Kennedy III, to focus mainly on cultivating foreign investment in the territory. Under a new agreement between the UK and the EU, Northern Ireland will essentially remain part of the EU common market, potentially making it more attractive for businesses.\n\nBiden will hail the ""tremendous progress"" since the Good Friday Agreement while also underscoring ""the readiness of the United States to preserve those gains and support Northern Ireland\'s vast economic potential to the benefit of all communities,"" according to John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council.\n\nAhead of the speech, Biden will sit for brief talks with Sunak, though won\'t participate in any major public events with him while he\'s here. Biden is also not attending next month\'s coronation of King Charles III in London, leading some to identify a generally negative attitude toward the United Kingdom. (The White House denies this, and points out no president has ever attended a British monarch\'s coronation.)\n\nHe\'s also expected to meet separately with the leaders of the five parties that make up Northern Ireland\'s power-sharing government, during which he\'s likely to stress the importance of resuming the arrangement as part of the Good Friday Agreement\'s legacy.\n\nIt remains to be seen how successful he will be, however, and some loyalists have quietly questioned how evenhanded the proudly Irish-American president can be when it comes to matters relating to his beloved ancestral homeland.\n\nBiden\'s speech is the only public event on his schedule in Belfast before he departs for Dublin in the Republic of Ireland later Wednesday afternoon. The second leg of his trip – with stops in two ancestral hometowns and a visit to the Knock Shrine – promises to be more personal, and less politically fraught, than his brief stop in Belfast. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/joe-biden-northern-ireland-speech/index.html"
"Biden administration proposes tough car pollution standards that would push US auto market aggressively toward EVs In what would be one of the Biden administration\'s most aggressive climate-change policies yet, the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed ambitious new car pollution rules that could push the US auto market strongly towards electric vehicles over the next decade.\n\nUnder the proposed tailpipe standards, electric vehicles could account for up to two-thirds of new cars sold in the US by 2032, White House and EPA officials said.\n\nThe standards would also have the effect of cutting planet-warming pollution from cars in half. Transportation accounts for nearly 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US, according to the EPA.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan called the regulations ""the strongest-ever federal pollution standards for cars and trucks.""\n\n""Together, these actions will accelerate the ongoing transition to a clean vehicles future, tackle the climate crisis and improve our air quality for communities across the country,"" Regan added.\n\nEPA officials said that they are considering several different emissions proposals, which could result in anywhere from a 64% to 69% electric vehicle adoption rate by early next decade. If approved, the emissions standards would start model year 2027 vehicles.\n\nThe agency anticipates the new rule would mean EVs could also make up nearly half of all new medium-duty vehicles, like delivery trucks, by model year 2032. Officials are also proposing stronger standards for heavy-duty vehicles, including dump trucks, public utility trucks, and transit and school buses.\n\nOne expert told CNN the Biden administration\'s proposal is a pivotal moment for the US auto industry and consumers.\n\n""It\'s a pretty big deal,"" said Thomas Boylan, a former Environmental Protection Agency official and the regulatory director for the EV trade group Zero Emission Transportation Association. ""This is really going to set the tone for the rest of the decade and into the 2030s in terms of what this administration is looking for the auto industry to do when it comes to decarbonizing and ultimately electrifying.""\n\nRegan and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi hailed the proposed regulations as a major climate win that would also save American consumers money in the coming years.\n\nZaidi said that in the Biden administration\'s first few years, the number of EVs on US roads had already tripled, while the number of public charging stations had doubled. And Zaidi vowed more to come, with funding from Biden\'s infrastructure law for a network of EV charging stations combined with consumer tax credits.\n\n""Whether you measure today\'s announcements by the dollars saved, the gallons reduced, or the pollution that will no longer be pumped into the air, this is a win for the American people,"" Zaidi said.\n\nYet even as the administration is writing aggressive regulations to push the market toward EVs, a Gallup poll released Wednesday suggests that Americans are not yet sold on the idea. Gallup polled more than 1,000 adults in the US last month and found that 41% said they would not buy an electric vehicle.\n\nNot only are EVs still more expensive than gas-powered cars, but consumers also haven\'t yet grasped the climate benefits of transitioning to zero-emissions vehicles, the poll found. Six in 10 respondents said they believe EVs help the environment ""only a little"" or ""not at all,"" Gallup reported.\n\nTransportation is the biggest source of planet-warming pollution in the US, and light duty vehicles – the average cars Americans drive – account for 58% of those emissions. The UN\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported last year that aggressive, pollution-slashing changes in the global transportation sector – including the transition to EVs – could reduce the sector\'s emissions by more than 80%.\n\n""This is what we mean when we say that tackling the climate crisis is about creating opportunity – an opportunity to put the United States on a clear path to win the jobs and the industries of the 21st century,"" Regan said.\n\nOther countries, including the EU and China, are moving faster toward adopting EVs. In the US, California has already proposed that zero-emissions vehicles make up 70% of new car sales by 2030, and 17 other states plan to follow California\'s lead.\n\nThat means much of the US car industry will already be transitioning ahead of the proposed federal rule.\n\n""I believe it\'s pretty doable,"" Margo Oge, chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation and a former Obama EPA official, said of the aggressive transition to EVs. ""The industry is there. Europe is ahead of the US, China is ahead of Europe – and these companies are global companies.""\n\nNew federal tax credits are coming next week that aim to help American consumers save up to $7,500 on an EV. But they have incredibly complex requirements for the auto industry – including that the cars\' batteries and components come from the US or countries it has a free-trade agreement with.\n\nStill, Boylan said the regulations are designed to gradually work over the next decade, by which time consumers should have far more electric vehicle options to choose from.\n\n""You\'ve got the tax credits as the carrot,"" Boylan said. The proposed tailpipe regulation ""provides the stick to backstop these incentives and push the industry forward.""\n\nThe EPA will take public comment on the proposal before finalizing a rule in the coming months. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/car-pollution-standards-electric-vehicles-biden-climate/index.html"
"HRW slams Pakistan for 'forcibly evicting' thousands of farmers Islamabad, Pakistan – A prominent rights body has slammed Pakistani authorities for ""forcibly evicting"" thousands of farmers for an infrastructure project near Lahore city, the capital of the eastern Punjab province.\n\nIn a report published on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch said the authorities should ""enforce environmental protections and reform colonial-era laws that grant the government broad powers to acquire land for private as well as public use"".\n\nThe $7bn Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project (RUDA) was launched in 2020 by the then Prime Minister Imran Khan to resolve issues such as pollution, sewage, water, housing, and employment while also reviving the historic city\'s ""lost glory"".\n\nDuring the launch, Khan had claimed the project would also help provide solutions for civic problems afflicting Lahore, the country\'s second-largest city with a population of more than 13 million people.\n\nThe proposed plan also aimed to create the ""world\'s largest riverfront city"" by acquiring land to house about 12 million more people.\n\nHowever, according to the HRW, the government acted on behalf of private developers to acquire the necessary property, 85 percent of which was agricultural land on which nearly a million farmers, labourers and business owners depended for their livelihoods.\n\n""Affected farmers who have challenged the legality of the land seizures have faced intimidation and criminal charges brought by the governmental Ravi Urban Development Authority (RUDA), provincial authorities, and project developers, even as these legal challenges remain pending in court,"" it said.\n\nThe rights group said since 2020, the Pakistani authorities ""criminally charged more than 100 farmers with resisting or refusing to hand over land they occupied"".\n\nThe farmers filed a petition at the Lahore High Court (LHC), which in January last year declared the project illegal as it violated laws concerning the acquisition of land and compensation.\n\nThe court\'s decision, however, was partially overruled a month later by the country\'s Supreme Court, which said the project could continue only on the land the government had already acquired.\n\nThe farmers allege the authorities continue to seize land despite the top court\'s order, an allegation the RUDA denies.\n\nThe HRW said it spoke to at least 14 farmers earlier this year, who alleged they were either evicted or threatened with eviction by the authorities.\n\n""Accounts by farmers along with corroborating photos and video show evidence of intimidation, harassment, and use of force to evict farmers. The exact number of people affected or forcibly evicted has been difficult to determine, including by groups representing farmers,"" its report said.\n\nThe HRW report further cited environmentalists who have warned that the project could alter the flow of the Ravi River, significantly increasing flooding risks.\n\nPakistan is yet to recover from catastrophic floods last year that submerged nearly a third of the nation.\n\nLawyer Fahad Malik, who represents the farmers affected by the project, told Al Jazeera that out of roughly 43,700 hectares (108,000 acres) of land sought by the government, 28,330 hectares (70,000 acres) is agricultural land.\n\n""Landowners have little influence or say in determining the adequacy or impact of the proposed \'public purpose\' for which the land is being acquired and can realistically only question the amount of compensation being received,"" Malik said. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/hrw-slams-pakistan-for-forcibly-evicting-thousands-of-farmers"
"LEE BOYCE: Banks should reward us for our loyalty every ten years Sometimes, reading your letters really is a joy.\n\nLong-time Money Mail reader Keith, 71, this week topped a cracking pile of post sent to our London office with a terrific idea that got me thinking.\n\nYou see, Keith and his wife, 76, have banked with First Direct for exactly 30 years this month.\n\nThat will make them among First Direct's most loyal customers, as it was only set up by the old Midland Bank as a telephone banking service 34 years ago.\n\nForgotten savers: Banks typically only reward new customers with juicy perks. But what about loyalists who stick with their providers through thick and thin?\n\nYet, as Keith points out, banks such as First Direct typically only reward new customers with juicy perks.\n\nUsually it's around £200 if you agree to switch your main current account (and the bribe does work: the last three months of last year were the busiest ever for the official switching service).\n\nBut what about loyalists like Keith who stick with their bank through thick and thin?\n\nHere's his pitch: 'While we're perfectly satisfied with the service it would be nice if banks offered a loyalty reward to customers like us.\n\n'Not cash -- a small gift: theatre tickets, gift voucher, bottle of wine, even a thank you would be appreciated.'\n\nSo, bank bosses -- we know you read these pages! -- here's my challenge: how about offering customers a little something for every ten years of loyal custom?\n\nA little giveaway to say: thanks for sticking with us despite easy cash on offer elsewhere.\n\nAs Keith points out, it's an inexpensive idea for banks -- but just the sort of gesture that might keep many of us coming back for another decade…\n\nWhy are councils making it so hard for people to park?\n\nThey're stripping out machines that accept cards and coins and forcing people to pay with their phones. Some of the apps you have to use even charge you a fee for the privilege.\n\nIf you don't have a phone, you're stuffed. And even if you do, councils use different apps, different sign-ups and, depending on your network, you might not even have internet signal, let alone the all-too-common problem of a drained battery.\n\nLast summer, in a rural car park in Norfolk there were no machines to pay, just a sign with details of how to pay by app.\n\nAfter fiddling around creating an account, the patchy mobile signal meant it took ages to finally get my £2 payment accepted.\n\nWhile I was doing all this two other motorists asked me if I knew how to pay to park and, after hearing of my struggles, drove out of the car park, and out of the village -- depriving local shops of their spending.\n\nCouncils need to re-think ripping out parking machines, or they may inadvertently end up ripping the heart out of entire town centres.\n\nThose savvy bunch who haggle on their car insurance, home cover and broadband bill spend an average of 92 minutes on the phone in total, new data shows.\n\nWith bills heading higher, those 92 minutes are important to drive down the cost.\n\nBut these bloated calls feel entirely unnecessary. Recently, I had to switch my home cover away from Esure thanks to a huge renewal hike.\n\nIt was easy to log in online, speak to a chatbot who said I couldn't get a cheaper price -- but, to cancel the auto-renewal, there was no option but to call.\n\nI was left on hold for more than ten minutes -- which goes against Money Mail's Pick Up Or Pay Up campaign, where we want firms to answer within that ten-minute period.\n\nBut while I finally managed to cancel and no renewal payment was taken, some haven't been so lucky.\n\nA trickle of Money Mail readers say they have cancelled their renewal in good time with other providers over the phone, only for the payment to be taken out, effectively meaning they've paid for insurance twice -- and then they have to call again to sort the problem.\n\nInsurers must make it far easier and quicker to cancel policies, especially given the huge renewal quotes households face this year, or pay serious penalties.\n\nl.boyce@dailymail.co.uk https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/comment/article-11960959/LEE-BOYCE-Banks-reward-loyalty-ten-years.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

"Taiwan's ruling party picks William Lai as presidential candidate Taiwan\'s ruling party has nominated Vice President William Lai as its candidate for next year\'s presidential elections.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party\'s (DPP) choice of Lai, a man who has been more outspoken on Taiwanese independence than President Tsai Ing-wen, is almost certain to anger China.\n\nBeijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to reunite the self-governed island.\n\nThe DPP\'s announcement on Wednesday came two days after China formally ended three days of military drills around Taiwan that included simulated attacks on key targets on the island.\n\n""I am very honoured to have received the DPP\'s nomination to take part in the 2024 presidential election and to uphold the duty of safeguarding Taiwan,"" Lai told reporters in Taipei.\n\nThe 63-year-old has long been considered the frontrunner for the DPP nomination to succeed Tsai, who is barred from running again after her second four-year term ends in May 2024.\n\nLai has long held that Taiwan cannot attain a peaceful future by appeasing China and has urged the island\'s residents to unite against its authoritarianism.\n\nOn Wednesday, he reiterated that stance.\n\n""Now, the democratic bloc in the international community has noticed China\'s threat to the international community, and is concerned with the importance of peace in the Taiwan Strait,"" Lai said.\n\n""You must prepare for war to avoid war, to stop a war you must be able to fight a war.""\n\nChina has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan since Tsai\'s 2016 election as she views the island as a de facto sovereign nation.\n\nLai lauded Tsai\'s two terms as president, saying the world has recognised Taiwan\'s democratic credentials under her leadership.\n\n""In the future, I will continue to strengthen democratic Taiwan in the same democratic path, so the world can see Taiwan\'s value, and embrace Taiwan,"" he said.\n\nThe doctor-turned-politician has previously described himself as a ""pragmatic Taiwan independence worker"".\n\nIn January, he explained that this means he considers the island to already be a ""sovereign country and there is no need for Taiwan to declare independence again"".\n\nBeijing has said any Taiwanese move towards a declaration of formal independence would prompt a military response.\n\n""In the face of China\'s attacks with rhetoric and threats with its military, we will not change our peaceful stance,"" Lai said, suggesting he would work towards peace-building with Beijing.\n\n""We will also not give up any chance for peace,"" he added, saying both sides need to work together to improve the lives of people on either side of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nLai also sent a message to voters, saying next year\'s polls will be ""a choice between democracy or authoritarianism"". https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/taiwans-ruling-party-picks-william-lai-as-presidential-candidate"
"iOS 16.4.1 Gives Your iPhone an Important Security Update     - CNET Apple released iOS 16.4.1 last Friday, a little more than two weeks after the release of iOS 16.4. The latest update fixes a few problems that some users might've experienced with iPhone features, and, importantly, it also brings security fixes and bug patches to issues that might be actively exploited on your iPhone.\n\nYou can download the update by going to Settings   General   Software Update and tapping Download and Install.\n\nHere's what you'll get in the update and why you should download it.\n\nThe most important things in the latest update are patches for two security issues that Apple said might be actively exploited.\n\nApple said in one instance, an app could execute arbitrary code kernel privileges. According to MalwareBytes, kernel privileges are a serious issue since they offer greater access than administrative privileges. That means someone could access your personal files, load their own malicious code or programs onto your device or alter your system however they want.\n\nThe other fix applies to a WebKit issue where some malicious web content may lead to a code execution. According to Okta, this is a form of hacking that can be used to execute commands on your device without your knowledge. It can be used to load a virus, alter software and cause other issues on your device.\n\nBoth of these issues can be exploited, compromising your iPhone and your personal information. However, iOS 16.4.1 should fix both issues and protect you and your device.\n\nThe iOS 16.4.1 update also fixes two issues users have run into: Siri not responding to requests, and the new pushing hands emoji not showing various skin tones.\n\nHere are Apple's release notes for iOS 16.4.1:\n\nThis update provides important bug fixes and security updates for your iPhone including:\n\nSome features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices. For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website:\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT20122\n\nFor more, check out what you might have missed in iOS 16.4 and what could be coming in iOS 16.5. https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ios-16-4-1-gives-your-iphone-an-important-security-update/#ftag=CAD590a51e"
"EPA Proposes Strict Emissions Standards That Could Boost EV Sales by 60%     - CNET The US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed strict new emissions standards for cars, trucks and other light-duty vehicles that could lead sales of EVs to increase nearly tenfold by 2032.\n\nIn what EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan called a ""very ambitious proposal"" in a call with reporters, the rules would greatly expand current emissions standards, which are slated to expire in 2026, and embrace clean-car technology that wasn\'t available when the previous standards were set.\n\nRead on: The Best New EVs on the Market\n\nWhat does this mean for consumers? If the regulations were followed by automakers, the EPA said, electric vehicles would account for a growing segment of car sales over in the coming years, reaching 67% of the market by the time 2032 models rolled off the assembly line.\n\nIn addition, requirements for better fuel mileage and lower maintenance costs could save car owners an average of $12,000 over the life of their vehicle.\n\nRegan didn\'t have a timeline for the adoption of the new standards, which will go through a lengthy public comment period and could be substantially revised. The EPA also proposed tougher emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles like delivery trucks, school buses and tractor-trailers. The combined result of the new rules would be a reduction of about 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide through 2055, Regan said.\n\n""By proposing the most ambitious pollution standards ever for cars and trucks, we are delivering on the Biden-Harris administration\'s promise to protect people and the planet, securing critical reductions in dangerous air and climate pollution and ensuring significant economic benefits like lower fuel and maintenance costs for families,"" he added in a statement.

"Autopilot Ethics And The Illusory Self I think most people reading this blog agree that the folk idea of a ""self"" is bunk. There is no ghost or homunculus unconstrained by physical reality controlling our body, nor are our future or past actions understandable or predictable by our current self.\n\nI assume this seems unimportant to you, it seemed unimportant to me. But when I was trying to steelman Harris\' case for harping on so much about free will, I think I accidentally managed to convince myself I was wrong in thinking it so irrelevant a matter.\n\nAmong philosophers, a guy like Chalmers or Nagle is actually fairly niche and often cited just for the association. Which are the philosophers\' people actually read, say the one that the vast majority of politicians have read? Well, for example, John Rawls.\n\nRemember Rawls\' ""original condition,"" thought experiment? What most people take to be the underpinning of our commonly agreed upon political philosophy?... yeah, you\'re right, that makes no sense unless you assume you are a magical ghost that\'s just so happening to control a human body.\n\nAnd suddenly you realize that a very very large swath of philosophy and thought in general, both modern and historical, might be laboring under this completely nonsensical model of the mind/self that we simply fail to notice.\n\nSince I wrote that, I kept thinking of more and more situations where laboring under this model seems to cause a great amount of confusion.\n\nI think one is people thinking about algorithms used to control things like cars making decisions of ethical importance. The very idea of an autopilot having to make an ethical decision is kind of silly, given how rarely such a situation occurs on the road in which someone must be harmed. But let me grant that there are situations in which an autopilot might be forced to make a split-second decision with ethical import.\n\nMaybe not quite a trolley problem, something more realistic, like breaking quickly enough to endanger the driver or bumping slightly into the car in front, thus damaging it and putting its passengers in slight danger. Or deciding whether to veer off-road into a ditch or hit a child that jumped in the middle of the street. You get the point, take your pick of a semi-reasonable thought experiment where one way or another the autopilot is likely to cause harm to someone\n\nThe ""real"" answer to this question is that nobody has the ability to give a general answer. The best you can do is observe the autopilot\'s behavior in a given instance.\n\nNote: assume I\'m talking about any popular self-driving software   hardware suite you\'d like\n\nThe autopilot follows simple rules with a focus on getting to a destination without crashing or breaking any laws. Under any conditions of risk (e.g. road too wet, mechanical detect) it delegates the wheel and option to keep going to a human driver, or outright blocks the car until help can arrive.\n\nWhen it comes to split-second decisions where risk is involved, there is no ""ethics module"" that kicks in to evaluate the risk. If the car can\'t be safely stopped, the autopilot will try to unsafely stop it. How it does this is a generative rule stemming out of its programming for more generic situations. Since the amount of specific dangerous situations is infinite, you can\'t really have specific rules for all (or any) of them.\n\nPeople gasp at this in horror, ""well how can you entrust a thing to take away a human\'s life if it doesn\'t reason about ethics"".\n\nIt\'s at this point that the illusory self comes in. Obviously, with a moment of clear thinking, it\'s obvious that a human is no different from an autopilot in these circumstances.\n\nYour system of ethics, education, feelings about those in the car or about the people on the road will not come into play when making a split-millisecond decision. What will come into play is... well, a complex interaction of fast-acting sub-systems which we don\'t understand.\n\nAt no point will you ponder the ethics of the situation, who to endanger and who not to, while trying to stop a car going 100km/h in the span of less than a second.\n\nPeople thinking about wanna-be trolley problems in traffic and assuming they know how they would react are just confused about their own mind, thinking their actions are going to be consistent with the narrative they are living at a given moment, under any circumstances.\n\nWhat I find interesting in this scenario though, besides the number of people being fooled by it, is that it doesn\'t have to do with self-control or preference predictions. It\'s simply a scenario that\'s too quick for any ""self like"" thing to be in control, yet for some reason, we are convinced that, were we to be put in such a situation, we could act from a place that is, or at least feels similar to, the current self.\n\nOne interesting point here though is that an autopilot could in theory aspire to make such decisions while thinking ethically, even if a human can\'t, since compute might allow for it.\n\nCurrently, we hold humans liable if they make a mistake on the road, but only to the extent that we take away their right to drive, which is the correct utilitarian response (and too seldom does it happen). But nobody goes to prison for killing a pedestrian outside of situations where the accident was due to previous acts that conscious decisions could have avoided (getting in the car drunk, getting in the car without a license).\n\nHowever, car companies could be held liable for killing pedestrians, and the liability could be in the dozens or hundreds of millions, since, unlike people, they can afford this. That would lead to a race to get a 100% safe autopilot and we might expect that autopilot to do superhuman things such as reason morally under split-millisecond constraints and take the correct decision.\n\nBut right now I think we are far away from that, and most people still oppose autopilots on grounds that they are inferior to people. This is what I\'m hoping to help debunk here.\n\nPublished on: 2022-12-0 https://cerebralab.com/Autopilot_Ethics_And_The_Illusory_Self"

"Building a Brighter Future: How AI Can Empower the Black Community By Joy Fennell, Founder of The Future in Black \n\nAre you a black tech-skeptic? Perhaps you've survived a computer crash, or you're pretty sure Siri has grand plans for world domination (we've all had those thoughts, right?).\n\nWell, it's time to cast those fears aside and embrace technology like a long-lost cousin at the family reunion. Hey cousin! Embracing technology can provide increased economic opportunities, improve access to education, level up our social economic status, close the digital divide, and build a strong, supportive community.\n\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) continues to permeate every aspect of our daily lives, the question of who builds, designs, and influences these technologies is of the utmost importance. With AI systems affecting everything from job recruitment and medical diagnoses to financial decisions and social media algorithms, representation across races and ethnicities is vital to ensure fair and unbiased outcomes. This article will delve into the importance of black representation in AI, focusing on four key aspects: empowering the black creative community, ensuring fairness, fostering innovation, and promoting generational wealth.\n\nFor a long time, the black creative community hasn't been given the recognition and opportunities it deserves in the world of technology, and AI is no exception. Yet, we have so much to offer in terms of knowledge, experience, and unique insights that can help shape the development and application of AI systems.\n\nBy making a genuine effort to involve the black creative community in AI development, we can gain a deeper, more well-rounded understanding of the world and create technology that serves everyone. Involving people from underrepresented backgrounds in the process helps AI systems become more versatile and less likely to perpetuate biases, ultimately making the benefits of AI accessible to all.\n\nAI systems are often trained on massive datasets containing information from millions of people, and these datasets can carry the biases and prejudices that exist in society. The lack of representation in AI development teams increases the likelihood that these biases will go unnoticed or unaddressed, leading to AI systems that perpetuate and even amplify existing inequalities.\n\nBlack representation in AI matters because it can help to identify and rectify these biases during the development process. By including black people in AI development, we can ensure that the experiences of black people are incorporated into the technology, reducing the chance that AI systems will unfairly disadvantage us. Addressing these biases not only creates a more equitable society but also improves the overall quality and utility of AI systems. Let's create the future!\n\nBlack people have a rich cultural history that has been historically exploited and appropriated by others. Everyone benefits from our culture but us and that must change. However, with the power of new technology such as AI, AR, VR 3D, and the internet, we can now build our own tables (and add chairs) by monetizing our own culture.\n\nBy leveraging digital platforms to create and distribute our own content, black creators can showcase their unique perspectives and experiences to a global audience. From music to fashion to art, we can create and monetize our own content without relying on traditional gatekeepers (I'm sure you know of some) or cultural brokers.\n\nThis can lead to greater economic opportunities and allow us to take control of our own narrative and culture. With the ability to build and monetize our own culture, we can finally get the recognition and compensation they deserve for all of our contributions to society.\n\nAI has the potential to revolutionize industries, generating significant economic value and wealth. As AI continues to advance, there will be increased demand for skilled professionals in the field, leading to high-paying jobs and business opportunities. By increasing black representation in AI, we create more opportunities for black individuals and communities to benefit from this economic growth, contributing to the reduction of the wealth gap and fostering generational wealth.\n\nBlack representation in AI can also lead to more targeted solutions that address the specific challenges faced by black communities, such as financial inclusion, access to quality education, and affordable healthcare. These AI-driven solutions can create lasting, positive change, further contributing to the accumulation of generational wealth within black communities.\n\nHaving a diverse group of people working in AI isn't just about sidestepping issues; it's also a catalyst for fresh ideas, unique approaches, and innovative solutions. The black creative community has the ability to introduce new viewpoints to the field, igniting innovation and propelling progress.\n\nBy nurturing and encouraging black representation in AI, we can explore previously uncharted areas of research and application, broadening the scope of what AI can achieve. Involving black professionals in AI development enables us to tap into a wealth of potential, ultimately leading to groundbreaking products and services that cater to a diverse range of users.\n\nSo here's the bottom line: empowering the black creative community, ensuring fairness, fostering innovation, and promoting generational wealth are essential components of why black representation in AI matters. As AI continues to reshape our world, it is critical that we recognize the importance of representation and take steps to ensure that underrepresented voices are heard. By embracing black representation in AI, we can create a future where technology is not only powerful and efficient but also just, equitable, and economically inclusive.\n\nBy Joy Fennell, Founder of The Future in Black , follow us for more articles coming soon! https://thefutureinblack.medium.com/building-a-brighter-future-how-ai-can-empower-the-black-community-aa9a595145a9"

"Secret Service fights to shed politics - but Trump's indictment, 2024 election are major tests WASHINGTON – Inside a darkened room, on the fourth floor of Secret Service headquarters, a panel of video screens offer an extraordinary window into the agency\'s future – long on hold.\n\nA replica of the White House, including both east and west wings, along with the sweeping south lawn, appears as if transported to an 18-acre lot, about 20 miles north of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe nearly $10 million Maryland training facility project has remained an unrealized dream, even after a series of high-profile White House security breaches raised serious questions about the agency\'s training regimen in which agents and officers have drilled on an empty parking lot with an imaginary mansion in the background.\n\n""It is unfathomable,"" Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a rare interview with USA TODAY, referring to the absence of such a tool.\n\nBill Barr:DOJ could have \'very good evidence\' of possible Trump obstruction in documents case\n\nAlmost a decade after the project was last proposed, Cheatle believes the agency is closer than ever to winning congressional approval. While the project would represent the largest addition to the Secret Service\'s physical footprint in years, it also carries weighty symbolism for an agency anxious to turn the page on a turbulent era in which its performance and apolitical brand have been called into question.\n\nFor Cheatle, 52, the stakes could not be higher as the service confronts long-standing challenges, including chronic staffing shortages and training struggles, even as it gears up for a potentially volatile 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nQuestions about the agency\'s independence have been just as jarring after the service was swept up in a House committee\'s investigation of the Capitol attack and an inquiry into missing text communications around the time of the insurrection.\n\n""I think, unfortunately, the Secret Service has been painted, at times inaccurately, as being a political organization and we\'re not,"" Cheatle said. ""We don\'t talk politics here. We are an agency that truly does take pride in our apolitical mission.""\n\nSeven months into her tenure as director, Cheatle, just the second woman to lead the agency, appears most anxious to reclaim the agency\'s mission – sans the drama.\n\nThe timeline for any reset, however, will have to be quick as the 2024 campaign already has begun.\n\nTrump returns gift:Trump says missing golf club sent to Archives after Democrats criticized him for not reporting gifts\n\nThat campaign already features Donald Trump, whose bid to reclaim the White House will now feature awkward stops for court appearances in Manhattan. The former president was charged with 34 felony counts in New York related to a hush money scheme to silence an adult film star in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign about an alleged affair years earlier.\n\nTrump, the first former president to face criminal charges also faces possible legal jeopardy in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. State and federal prosecutors are pursuing separate criminal investigations in his handling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe unprecedented prosecution of a former president, also thrusts the Secret Service into a previously unimagined role that is already testing the boundaries of the agency\'s obligation to provide lifetime protection for a former president who is now a criminal defendant. Secret Service agents escorted Trump to his arraignment last week. And some service representatives were expected to testify in the Justice Department\'s special counsel inquiry into Trump\'s handling of classified documents, Fox News first reported this month.\n\n""We are in uncharted territory here,"" said W. Ralph Basham, who led the agency during the George H.W. Bush administration. ""I\'m sure the attorneys are scrambling to find answers to those questions.""\n\nSecret Service scandals:Drinking, a fence-jumper, now deleted texts: How scandals have dogged the Secret Service for years\n\nAt perhaps no time in its history has federal law enforcement\'s independence been scrutinized more than in the shadow cast by the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol assault. Questions about a lack of preparation and urgency of response still linger more than two years after rioters sought to halt the certification of President Joe Biden\'s election.\n\nAnd some of the sharpest body blows landed on the Secret Service that has long prided itself on operating outside of politics, protecting presidents of all political stripes in sensitive times.\n\nLast year\'s disclosure that text messages were missing from the agency\'s cache of communications around the time of the Capitol attacks prompted an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security\'s inspector general.\n\nThe temporary assignment of a top agency executive, Tony Ornato, to serve in a political role as deputy chief of staff in the Trump White House, during the time of the Jan. 6 assault, triggered blistering criticism from lawmakers and some former agency officials who described the appointment as a contravention of the agency\'s apolitical role.\n\nAmong the harshest assessments was delivered by John Magaw, another former Secret Service director, who in an earlier interview with USA TODAY described the arrangement as ""horrendous."" Ornato retired from the agency late last summer.\n\n""That decision crossed the line into politics,"" Magaw said in July as the Secret Service drew the scrutiny of the special House committee investigating the Capitol attacks.\n\nSecret Service troubles raise worries:Ex-officials worried by troubling Secret Service case as agency struggles with hiring, training\n\nEnter Cheatle, a career agent who had briefly left government for an executive position at PepsiCo North America, overseeing facilities and personnel.\n\nIn announcing Cheatle\'s appointment as the 27th director of the agency last August, Biden referenced the challenge facing the service. He described Cheatle as ""easily the best choice to lead the agency at a critical moment for the Secret Service.""\n\n""She has my complete trust, and I look forward to working with her,"" Biden said at the time, adding that new director also had served on his protective detail when he was vice president.\n\nAnd in her first address to the ranks, Cheatle appeared to emphasize a desire for the agency to avoid the unnecessary spotlight.\n\n""We are tasked with a mandate that\'s difficult, dangerous, and most often in the public view and we carry it out together – quietly and efficiently, in the background of history,"" the new director said.\n\nAsked about the agency\'s handling of Ornato\'s controversial White House assignment, Cheatle told USA TODAY: ""I don\'t know that I would necessarily make the same decision."" Though she did not ""fault"" the agency\'s prior leadership team.\n\nCheatle also sought to slam the door on questions that had swirled about the agency\'s response to the Capitol attacks, specifically the actions taken to protect then-Vice President Mike Pence and whether there were provisions to transport Pence away from the Capitol that would have resulted in blocking him from carrying out the certification of Biden\'s election.\n\nManhattan DA sues GOP Rep. Jordan:Manhattan DA Bragg sues House GOP Rep. Jordan over Donald Trump criminal case\n\n""I was the assistant director of Protective Operations at the time, and I know the planning that went on for both the rally site...on the (White House) Ellipse that day and for the vice president\'s visit to the Capitol,"" Cheatle said. ""There was no nefarious intent to have anything stopped that day. Our folks, again, did their job...""\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the former co-chair of the House panel that investigated the Capitol attack, acknowledged his concerns about the challenges facing the agency.\n\n""I\'ve had concerns with the direction in which the agency has moved in, particularly under the previous administration, and I\'ve discussed them with Director Cheatle, who has given me her commitment to putting the Service on the right path,"" Thompson said. ""We must ensure that the agency operates effectively, in an apolitical manner, and works to improve workforce morale and restore public trust in the agency.""\n\nTrump trying to stop Pence testimony:Donald Trump attempting to stop Mike Pence from testifying about Jan. 6 Capitol riot\n\nThe heat of the 2024 presidential race is still months away, but the looming election cycle also spotlights persistent challenges for the Secret Service: staffing and training.\n\nLast year, hundreds of agents working protection missions maxed out annual overtime and salary allowances that will require the agency to once again seek congressional authorization to make up back pay for the unpaid time worked, according to service records.\n\nIn preparation for the 2024 campaign, which already includes protective details assigned to Trump and Biden (who is expected to formally announce a reelection bid), the Department of Homeland Security has requested an additional $191 million to ensure the campaign is ""adequately resourced for the protection of major candidates, nominees, their spouses, and nominating conventions.""\n\nAlready, the agency has identified 16 separate protective details to begin training in advance of the election season. Because details work on three-week rotations, the number does not represent actual candidates that would receive protection. But the agency is gearing up to accommodate several possible candidates who may require round-the-clock security, as determined by the DHS.\n\nTrump indictment takeaways:Donald Trump was arrested. What you need to know about the arraignment and charges\n\nThe preparations are part of a sprawling election plan that in years past have drilled agents on scenarios ranging from urban combat to manning rope-lines and securing stages.\n\nMajor presidential and vice presidential candidates automatically receive Secret Service protection within 120 days of the general election. But many candidates receive it much earlier in the campaign cycle.\n\nThe DHS budget proposal includes funding for 77 additional positions across the service.\n\nYet finding candidates to fill those jobs has been a never-ending challenge for the agency and much of law enforcement.\n\nFor every 250 applicants for special agent positions, officials said, only one is typically hired after a process that includes background checks and polygraph examinations.\n\nMuch of the effort to evaluate and accelerate the hiring process will be led by Cynthia Sjoberg Radway, the service\'s chief operating officer. Radway\'s appointment marks the first time women have held the senior roles of director and COO at the same time.\n\n""We\'re taking a hard look at our recruitment strategies,"" Radway said, adding that there is no plan to adjust past drug use prohibitions that have doomed many prospective candidates.\n\n""Maintaining the integrity"" of the selection process, Radway said, will not be compromised.\n\nWhat are Trump\'s 34 charges?:He\'s accused of falsifying business records in hush-money payments\n\nNearly a decade ago, after an Iraq war veteran scaled the White House fence and burst through the mansion\'s front door, a special advisory committee recommended two major additions to physical security and training for the Secret Service: build a higher perimeter fence and ""train in conditions that replicate the physical environment"" in which agents and uniform officers work.\n\nThe new fencing is now a reality. But a proposed training centerpiece – the construction of a replica White House on the agency\'s suburban Maryland training grounds – has yet to be realized.\n\nIn a 2015 appeal before a House Appropriations subcommittee, then-Director Joseph Clancy said agents and officers were staging White House training on ""a rudimentary, not-to-scale simulation of the north grounds of the White House, using bike barricades to act as the fencing.""\n\nTrump doorman story:Indictment details $30,000 payment to doorman who claimed he had info on a child\n\n""There are no structures, vehicle gates, lighting, or other aides to enhance the training simulations,"" according to Clancy\'s written testimony, which then requested $8 million for the construction of a White House replica to ""provide a more realistic environment, conducive to scenario-based training exercises...""\n\nMagaw said a replica would be ""very, very valuable"" to the agency\'s training program.\n\n""It would allow scenario training at all hours of the day and night to simulate actual events,"" the former director said. ""It would make the current training complex complete.""\n\nCheatle is moving to revive the project, viewing it as essential to agent and officer training and the security of the White House. Last year, Congress funded a feasibility study for the project, which will assist in determining the exact costs.\n\nIn its current virtual state, the plans provide for outside grounds and interior rooms that closely replicate the real thing.\n\nThe project would represent a transformative addition to the agency\'s training complex, where Cheatle once served as the special agent-in-charge.\n\n""No one has looked at this and said this is a bad idea,"" Cheatle said.\n\nClassified documents:Gang of Eight gets access to Trump, Biden and Pence classified documents https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/12/secret-service-trump-indictment-2024-election/11528488002/"
"How a 'strange sisterhood' of #MeToo accusers is reacting to Trump's indictment in hush money case They call themselves a ""strange sisterhood.""\n\nA friendship among nearly a dozen women was forged out of necessity and started years ago when they bonded over one commonality: They\'ve all accused former President Donald Trump of sexual harassment or battery.\n\nSix years later, the women still lean on each other, exchanging thoughts on an email chain. After Trump left a Manhattan courthouse last week, charged with more than two dozen counts of falsifying business records in connection with a New York hush money probe, an email from the chain hit their inboxes.\n\nThe subject line read: ""34 felonies!"" Two confetti emojis followed.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to more than 20 women who say they are victims of Trump in the aftermath of his historic indictment. Eight said they weren\'t comfortable speaking.\n\nBut four told USA TODAY the indictment is a sign of accountability to the law, but not to his character or treatment of women. While they view the indictment as a step closer to holding Trump accountable for his actions, they fear a repeat of 2016 where his alleged misconduct fuels his base and shields him from consequences heading into 2024.\n\nTrump\'s indictment, in part, hinges on his alleged role in hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. Though those women say their alleged encounters with Trump were consensual, Trump\'s #MeToo accusers say they see a common thread between the former president and his supporters\' behavior toward women then and now.\n\nThe former president has not made it easy for those who have come out against him. He has called his accusers ""liars"" and their reports ""made-up stuff."" The payments to Daniels and McDougal were meant to silence them. And nicknames – like ""horseface,"" for Daniels – belittle the women who stand up to him.\n\n""There is this millisecond of hope that maybe he will have to answer for at least some of his actions,"" said Samantha Holvey, one of the women on the chain. ""Then it was followed by the thought that his supporters probably won\'t even care.""\n\nSteven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump\'s campaign, declined to comment, calling the women\'s claims ""false rumors and completely made-up allegations,"" and threatening ""serious legal jeopardy"" for publishing their stories.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him in the criminal case.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nMore: 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Here\'s what their stories have in common.\n\nThe email chain began in 2017 after three of the women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct – Holvey, Rachel Crooks and Jessica Leeds – gave a December press conference demanding a congressional investigation into harassment allegations against Trump, Holvey said.\n\nIn 2017, the White House released a statement calling the women\'s claims ""false"" and ""totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts,"" suggesting the accusations were politically motivated.\n\nHolvey, 37, the 2006 Miss North Carolina USA, alleged in October 2016 that Trump inspected each of the pageant contestants individually, which made her feel like a ""piece of meat"" who was only ""there for his pleasure.""\n\nOver the years, more women have been added to their email thread.\n\n""On one hand, I wish we didn\'t have each other. I wish there weren\'t so many women that he\'s hurt,"" Holvey said. ""But on the other hand, I\'m glad I didn\'t feel alone going through the experience.""\n\nRachel Crooks, 40, accused Trump of kissing her without consent when she worked as a receptionist at Trump Tower in the early 2000s. She said she empathizes with women who claim similar experiences with the former president, such as Daniels and McDougal.\n\n""I know just how rough it can be to have half a country feeling a certain way about you just because you spoke out and spoke the truth about this man and it can be really trying,"" Crooks said.\n\nAn investigation by the Department of Justice found both Daniels and McDougal received hush money payments from the former president – $130,000 to Daniels before the 2016 election and $150,000 to McDougal. Both women claimed to have had sex with Trump, which he denied.\n\nDaniels claimed she would ""dance down the street"" before Trump was charged. But after the former president sat before a judge in New York last week, her lawyer said in a statement she ""feels bad that the guy has been charged.""\n\nThe women who spoke with USA TODAY said they\'re grateful that women are central to the first indictment Trump faces. But they\'re well aware that it comes at a cost.\n\nTwo women dealt a blow to Donald Trump\'s power: In a post-#MeToo era, will he fall?\n\nStormy Daniels on Trump indictment: Said she\'d dance in the streets if Trump was indicted, but now sad it happened\n\nTrump\'s indictment resurfaced similar feelings to how the women first felt after taking public stances against the former president.\n\nOn the day of the arraignment, Alva Johnson, 48, spent the afternoon flipping between cable TV news networks and reading live coverage online of Trump\'s time in court. The day\'s events brought back memories from 2016 when she worked as a staffer for the Trump campaign and accused the former president of kissing her without consent.\n\n""It definitely does send you right back to the very first feeling of just knowing that unfortunately you\'re forever linked to such a vile human,"" she said.\n\nThe White House in a 2019 statement called Johnson\'s accusation ""absurd on its face"" and said her description of the events is ""directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eyewitness accounts.""\n\nCrooks, who also accused Trump of kissing her without consent, recalled developing social anxiety after she came forward in 2016 while living in a region dominated by Trump supporters.\n\n""People that I previously had good relationships with – it did cause a lot of strain in some of those areas,"" Crooks said. ""Because for some people, Trump is this god and they think he can do no wrong.""\n\n""Even though they might have known me my whole life and trusted me, it just changed things,"" she said.\n\nThe women who came forward said their claims fell on deaf ears ahead of previous elections. Now, they worry 2024 could be the same.\n\n""I think this indictment will actually strengthen his base and make him appear to be a martyr. I don\'t know that it\'s going to have a negative effect on him,"" Holvey, the former pageant contestant, said. ""It\'s free publicity, which he loves. And his base – they\'re not going to believe that he did anything wrong.""\n\nTrump\'s supporters and top Republicans have largely echoed the former president\'s claims that the Manhattan probe is a ""witch hunt"" and akin to ""political persecution.""\n\nThe New York investigation is not the only legal inquiry he faces. The former president remains under investigation by prosecutors in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, holding onto classified documents after leaving office and the insurrection by supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nJohnson, the former Trump campaign staffer, said Trump continues to feed talking points to Republican politicians and cable news networks that help to normalize his behavior and ""build the propaganda"" to normalize possible crimes ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nTrump supporters have excused his offensive language against women as ""locker room talk"" and said those storming the Capitol were on a ""normal tourist visit.""\n\n""He\'s a criminal who continues to use political litigation as the excuse but it\'s really his weapon of choice,"" Johnson said.\n\nTo Crooks, the indictment feels like ""white noise"" amid his third attempt at the White House.\n\n""I would love for him to be held accountable,"" she said. ""But he\'s wriggled his way out of so many things before that you just kind of lose a little bit of belief that it\'ll happen.""\n\nBut for Kristin Anderson, a photographer and former model who in 2016 said Trump inappropriately touched her at a New York City nightclub in the early 1990s, the indictment is one piece of a bigger picture.\n\n""For all women who were abused and misused, every fragment of accountability adds up. We are getting closer and closer to freedom,"" Anderson said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks denied the incident in 2016 calling it a ""total fabrication"" and a ""political attack designed to tear down Mr. Trump.""\n\nIn the years since the women came forward, they\'ve found ways to protect their peace.\n\nHolvey – who recently picked out an engagement ring with her boyfriend and is a new puppy mom to a mini dachshund named Frank – has become an elder in a local church community.\n\nJohnson enjoys music, writing and ""sitting in the sun.""\n\nCrooks lives close to her family in northwest Ohio and is renovating a home built in the 1860s. She plans to ""do her yoga regularly"" as the 2024 election nears.\n\n""We are more than just this thing,"" Holvey said. ""We are more than just being called liars by the president.""\n\nBut as long as Trump remains a central figure in American politics, Crooks said she\'s unsure she\'ll ever be able to fully move forward.\n\n""Sadly, as long as he is living and striving for a role in politics, probably not. He\'s so prevalent,"" she said of the former president. ""But if and when his hold on the Republican Party and the people in this country subsides, then maybe. I certainly hope so.""\n\nIt\'s not the New York probe that Trump\'s accusers have their eyes on now; it\'s writer E. Jean Carroll\'s battery and defamation case against the former president.\n\nCarroll claims that a chance encounter with Trump in a Bergdorf Goodman luxury department store nearly 30 years ago ""took a dark turn"" when he ""forced her up against a dressing room wall, pinned her in place with his shoulder, and raped her,"" according to court documents.\n\nThe jury trial is set to begin on April 25. Trump has denied Carroll\'s claims.\n\n""I\'m watching E. Jean\'s case very closely,"" Holvey said. ""I think that is the case in which women have the opportunity to be heard and believed.""\n\nView the full gallery\n\nDonald Trump NY criminal indictment in photos\n\nA N.Y. grand jury voted to indict former president Donald Trump after hearing evidence related to money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels during Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign. https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2023/04/12/trump-indictment-2024-me-too/11576666002/"
"Fate of second Tennessee lawmaker expelled by Republican majority to be considered Wednesday The second of two young Democratic state legislators whose expulsion by Tennessee\'s Republican-led House provoked national backlash is expected to be reappointed to his seat in the state\'s House of Representatives Wednesday.\n\nIf reappointed, Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, will join Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, who returned to the House with the support of Nashville\'s Metro Council after being removed for leading gun-reform protests on the chamber floor following this month\'s mass shooting at a Nashville elementary school.\n\nAt least one of 13 commissioners in Shelby County, which Pearson represents, has committed to reappoint Pearson to his seat. The body will meet Wednesday afternoon to formally consider the issue.\n\nBoth Pearson and Jones, who are Black, had employed bullhorns during the protest and were expelled for violating House decorum. Along with Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, the so-called ""Tennessee Three"" had come under fire for approaching the podium in-session without being recognized.\n\nOn April 6, the House Republican supermajority removed Jones by a 72-25 vote and Pearson by a 69-26 vote after hours of rancorous debate. Johnson, who is white, avoided expulsion by one vote.\n\nOn Monday, Nashville\'s progressive-leaning council, responsible for filling Jones\' vacancy, voted to reappoint him to his seat on an interim basis pending a special election. Hundreds of cheering supporters flanked Jones as he returned to the Capitol shortly afterward to be sworn in.\n\nThe expulsions sparked broad national fallout, prompting reaction from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the NAACP, which framed the incident as ""horrific (but) not surprising…. Especially in the South.""\n\nIn his defense prior to his expulsion, Jones called the process ""a farce of democracy.""\n\nHundreds had assembled in the House galleries on March 30 to demand gun reform after six people, including three students, were fatally shot at The Covenant School in Nashville, the Volunteer State\'s deadliest-ever school shooting.\n\nPosting on social media afterward, Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton called the legislators\' part in the protests ""unacceptable"" and described it as ""an effort, unfortunately, to make themselves the victims.""\n\nAccording to the Tennessean, Sexton called on Jones to speak within minutes of his reclaiming his seat and was ultimately pushed to gavel supporters into order twice during Jones\' remarks.\n\n""Today, 78,000 people have a voice in this chamber once again,"" Jones said.

"Does ChatGPT Violate Compliance Rules &amp; Policies [Marketer Guide] The fuss around artificial intelligence(AI) has recently been the bone of contention. In fact, AI is disrupting virtually all sectors. Imagine if we get to a point where AI does all your tasks for you. Funny right?\n\nAnd you\'d ask–what would be left for me to do? Sure, you\'d still have to feed yourself and, perhaps, take your bath yourself. Who assigns those to AI? We\'re at such an exciting point in the world, and one of the generative AI tools making rounds recently is ChatGPT.\n\nIt\'s all over the news. ChatGPT provides answers to your queries. Talk of a tool for writing; it is also helpful for writing marketing copy, and computer codes.\n\nWith further advancements and upgrades, it can generate text, images, and other forms of content that are more or less the same as human-generated content.\n\nMany experts believe ChatGPT is non-compliant and violates compliance rules and policies. Could this be true? Let\'s take a ride into the full details.\n\nNo doubt, ChatGPT is an impressive technology. Talk of an incredible tool to process natural language. It is reliable to automate diverse types of communication.\n\nAs much as ChatGPT offers tremendous benefits, its advent has also spurred concerns around it, and that\'s normal with any new technology. Questions surrounding its safety and legality exist, particularly on data privacy and intellectual property rights.\n\nChatGPT\'s company, OpenAI, is located in California. As a matter of fact, it recognizes the California Consumer Privacy Act(CCPA) on its privacy policy page. OpenAI states that California residents have ""the right to know the Personal information it collects and how it is used and disclosed.\n\nThey also have the right to request deletion of their personal information and to be free from discrimination relating to exercising any privacy right."" Here are the questions on the lips of users.\n\nOpenAI\'s ChatGPT has questioned intellectual property (IP) law. Questions like–who owns the content generated by ChatGPT, and how should the content be managed and protected?\n\nShould ChatGPT be tagged as the original content creator for copyright purposes, and should it be entitled to the same IP protections as human creators? To further clarify this stance, ChatGPT itself has this to say:\n\n""As an AI language model, I don\'t have legal ownership or copyrights over the content I generate. The right of the content I produce would depend on the specific use case and context in which it was created.\n\nIn general, the ownership of the content is determined by the person or organization who created the input prompt or provided the data to generate the content.\n\nAdditionally, the legal implications of using the content I generate will depend on the specific laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction. It is essential to consult a legal expert for advice on any particular legal issues related to content generated by AI models like me.""\n\nHowever, Experts in the legal domain have come out to say ChatGPT, as a generative AI, is capable of copyright infringement and has the potential to face legal challenges. On the other hand, other experts maintain that anything created by generative AI systems is legally above any lawsuit.\n\nThink about this–each time you insert prompts for ChatGPT to provide answers to, you hand over sensitive information to the chatbox. You\'re taking a huge risk there. Your inputs are now part of ChatGPT\'s database.\n\nMoreover, your prompts can also be used to further train the tool and guide similar prompts from other persons. According to ChatGPT\'s privacy policy, it stores users\' IP addresses, browser types and settings, and data on users\' interactions with the tool.\n\nAs part of its policies, OpenAI states that it could share users\' personal information with unspecified third parties without informing them, so it can meet its business objectives.\n\nSuppose you have confidential business information restricting usage and insert such information into ChatGPT. In that case, the restrictions could be violated by a third party.\n\nTrade secret laws are simply to be kept as secrets. However, inserting such information into ChatGPT may expose and weaken your company\'s position.\n\nSuppose, as a company, your customers\' interaction with ChatGPT needs to be made made known. Say, one of your clients receives a document generated by ChatGPT from your company, you risk a chance to get claims of unfair or deceptive practices under state or federal law.\n\nHowever, this is dependent on the circumstance. Your customers could be enraged if they paid for the content and later discovered ChatGPT generated it.\n\nAs a marketer, consider how much you want to use ChatGPT in connection to your jobs. Weigh the efficiency you can attain using ChatGPT to perform tasks such as writing emails, routine letters, or generating simple reports.\n\nOne thing is sure–ChatGPT is not going away anytime soon. In fact, we anticipate its upgrades as time goes on. Marketers will need to address its use because subsequent versions will get better. Despite its risks, marketers can also leverage its benefits.\n\nAgain, marketers must be aware of the terms and conditions set by OpenAI, take the necessary steps to protect data privacy, and avoid using the tool for illegal activities or infringing on intellectual property rights.\n\nChatGPT has proven to be a revolutionary tool. You\'d agree that with it, we now have the features of a search engine in a chatbot.

"Starting small and simple was key to success for evolution of mammals, reveals new study The ancestors of modern mammals managed to evolve into one of the most successful animal lineages. The key was to start out small and simple, a new study reveals.\n\nIn many vertebrate groups, such as fishes and reptiles, the skull and lower jaw of animals with a backbone are composed of numerous bones. This was also the case in the earliest ancestors of modern mammals over 300 million years ago.\n\nHowever, during evolution, the number of skull bones was successively reduced in early mammals around 150 to 100 million years ago.\n\nPublishing their findings today in Communications Biology, an international team of paleontologists show how they used computer simulations and stress analyses to investigate the purpose of this skull simplification.\n\nTheir research demonstrates that reducing the number of skull bones did not lead to higher bite forces or increased skull strength as hypothesized for many decades. Instead, the team found that the skull shape of these early mammals redirected stresses during feeding in a more efficient way.\n\nLead author Dr. Stephan Lautenschlager, Senior Lecturer for Palaeobiology at the University of Birmingham, commented, ""Reducing the number of bones led to a redistribution of stresses in the skull of early mammals. Stress was redirected from the part of the skull housing the brain to the margins of the skull during feeding, which may have allowed for an increase in brain size.\n\n""Changes to skull structure combined with mammals becoming smaller are linked with a dietary switch to consuming insects--allowing the subsequent diversification of mammals which led to development of the wide-range of creatures that we see around us today.""\n\nThe study further demonstrated that alongside the reduction of skull bones, early mammals also became a lot smaller, some of which had a skull length of only 10–12 mm. This miniaturization considerably restricted the available food sources, and early mammals adapted to feeding mostly on insects.\n\nThis combination of small size, reduced number of skull bones, and feeding on new food sources such as insects, allowed the ancestors of modern mammals to thrive in the shadows of the dinosaurs.\n\nHowever, it was not until dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous, some 66 million years ago, that mammals had a chance to further diversify and reach the large range of body sizes seen today.\n\nMore information: Functional reorganisation of the cranial skeleton during the cynodont–mammaliaform transition, Communications Biology (2023).\n\nJournal information: Communications Biology\n\nProvided by University of Birmingham https://phys.org/news/2023-04-small-simple-key-success-evolution.html"

"You May Get More EV Options Thanks to Tougher Emissions Rules Automakers have made plenty of promises about electric vehicles. General Motors, Ford, and Volvo--some of the more ambitious--have pledged to sell only zero-emission cars by at least 2035. That\'s quite a commitment, as only 14 percent of new cars sold globally last year were electric, with the share in the US being half that.\n\nBut a new proposal released by the US Environmental Protection Agency today threatens to hold automakers to their electric big talk--and to up the ante. The agency suggested tighter emissions standards that it calculates would require electric vehicles to make up two-thirds of new passenger vehicle sales by 2032, sending millions more EVs onto dealership lots. It also wants to toughen standards for heavy trucks, albeit less aggressively.\n\nDuring a media briefing Wednesday, EPA administrator Michael Regan called the proposals, which would kick in in 2027, the ""strongest-ever federal pollution standards for cars and trucks."" If enacted, the rules could prevent the release of almost 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide through 2055.\n\nThe new pollution rules would operate by forcing automakers to ensure that each year between 2027 and 2032, the total emissions of all the vehicles they sell gets smaller. To meet those shrinking targets without slashing sales, manufacturers would have to offer a greener slate of vehicles. That could mean boosting fuel economy, offering more hybrids, or launching more cars powered by hydrogen or batteries. Consumers\' booming appetite for EVs, and the more than trillion dollars that automakers have earmarked for electrification, suggests that building more battery-powered cars may be the industry\'s easiest path to cutting emissions.\n\nThe proposals could become one of the Biden administration\'s most significant moves towards reducing air pollution and decarbonizing the US transportation system, which is alone responsible for more than a quarter of the nation\'s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTwo years ago, a bipartisan infrastructure deal poured $7.5 billion into building a nationwide EV charging network, so that drivers powered by plug might one day roam without fear of running out of power. Just last summer, the Inflation Reduction Act created new incentives for businesses thinking of electrifying their own fleets of cars and trucks, and launched new tax credits rewarding companies that manufacture batteries and electric cars in the US.\n\nAutomakers have complained that those new rules make it hard to build EVs that qualify for tax credits right now. But they have spurred new mining, battery building, and manufacturing projects in the US, the seedlings, the White House hopes, of a global car industry driven by the US and not China.\n\nDave Cooke, a senior vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the EPA\'s proposal builds on those previous policies to make clear what is expected of automakers as the US tries to curtail carbon emissions. ""We\'ve given them the carrot,"" he says. ""Now here\'s the stick.""\n\nWhat does that mean for drivers? If the EPA\'s tough new rules take effect, Americans should see many more affordable electric vehicles in dealership lots in the next decade. https://www.wired.com/story/you-may-get-more-ev-options-thanks-to-tougher-epa-emissions-rules/"
"5 steps to bringing Kubernetes costs in line What is the cost of being late to market? What is the impact of being unable to respond to unforeseen changes in the business environment like those experienced in 2020? Loss of customers, loss of market share, and loss of reputation, to name a few.\n\nTo be best positioned to innovate at the pace demanded in today\'s market, companies are turning to cloud-native computing as the engine to accelerate innovation. Cloud-native technologies have transformed the software development landscape in recent years, fueled by enterprises seeking greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency.\n\nSuch is the scale of this transition that the CNCF recently termed it the ""new normal."" A report last year titled Leveraging the Benefits of Cloud Native Technologies found that 77% of enterprises were already using cloud-native technologies across all or some of their applications. The CNCF reported 79%.\n\nRecent reports have also shown that adoption has fueled a dramatic growth in spending on Kubernetes and container-related infrastructure by businesses over the past two years.\n\nBut it would be a mistake for businesses to interpret these reports as a cue to put off or slow the adoption of cloud-native methodologies. The cost of fueling innovation is far less than the cost of being left behind, stymied by legacy infrastructure and slow delivery processes.\n\nThe keys, as in every disruptive technology transition, are first understanding the drivers of the costs and then maturing processes and governance structures to manage costs and maximize business ROI.\n\nWith the specter of growing costs looming especially large given the current economic uncertainty, businesses must understand the drivers behind these cost increases and the strategies available to manage them. From a poor architecture or inefficient resource usage to unanticipated business demands, there are myriad reasons for rising costs.\n\nFor example, self-service access to Kubernetes environments may result in development teams spinning up an excessive number of Kubernetes clusters. Also, companies often find it difficult to estimate Kubernetes costs before rolling out apps to production. More broadly, companies frequently lack a way to track unoptimized Kubernetes configurations, resulting in higher on-going infrastructure consumption.\n\nAt a more granular, practical level, what steps can organizations internalize to manage and align their Kubernetes costs with the business value of new innovative applications?\n\nLeverage open-source Kubernetes observability tools to implement Kubernetes cost management and take the guesswork out of Kubernetes spending. An example is the CNCF sandbox project OpenCost, which gives teams visibility into current and historical Kubernetes spend and resource allocation.\n\nPerform cost modelling in UAT (user acceptance testing) environments by passing test data to predict rough Kubernetes costs. This data can also provide insights into expensive microservices that may be spinning up too many pods and overusing compute resources that drive up costs. These microservices should be rearchitected or reconfigured.\n\nAdopt a hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud approach for your Kubernetes workloads to ensure that your Kubernetes costs are not locked into one provider or architecture. This will give you the flexibility to place workloads either on the cloud provider or on private, on-prem infrastructure, whichever provides the most cost-effective solution that meets operational requirements.\n\nConsume less. For instane, K3s, a CNCF sandbox project, delivers a lightweight yet powerful certified Kubernetes distribution that uses significantly less resources than standard Kubernetes.\n\nIncorporate some levels of governance into self-service access to Kubernetes clusters. Many companies are turning to a centralized ""platform engineering"" team to provide consistent services and pre-configured best practices to development teams, resulting in higher productivity and lower overall costs.\n\nUltimately, when making the transition to cloud-native computing, leaders must recognize there will be rising costs in new areas. However, in my view, cloud-native solutions delivered on Kubernetes and containers offer the most cost-effective means of delivering new, innovative services to the market today. The alternatives of VMs and bare metal are both less efficient at delivering the scale and agility to new business services.\n\nCosts won\'t be prohibitive to those with reasonable expectations and implementation plans. In preparation, organizations must define best practice policies and governance processes for delivering cloud-native workloads running on Kubernetes.\n\nDigital transformation is not without its challenges. Balancing costs joins integration issues, scalability, and security on the list of hurdles facing enterprises. In this light, cost issues are better seen as a factor to be managed rather than an existential threat. With customers demanding new, more effective services, innovation will continue to take priority. And, as I said at the beginning, these costs pale in comparison to the consequences of failing to respond to the market.\n\nBrent Schroeder is the global chief technology officer and head of the office of the CTO at SUSE.\n\nNew Tech Forum provides a venue to explore and discuss emerging enterprise technology in unprecedented depth and breadth.

"How To Take Control Of Your Company's Profitability How To Take Control Of Your Company's Profitability\n\nProfitability is key for a business; you need profit to grow and stay in business for the long term. Are you looking for ways to increase the profitability of your business? Knowing where to start when trying to boost profits can be challenging, but luckily there are a few things you can do immediately that will help.\n\nWhen a business is profitable, it demonstrates to others that it has value, opening doors to new investments or partnerships which can further propel the company forward. While there is no guarantee of success when starting a business, there can only be progress with profit.\n\nThe first step in taking control of your company's profitability is understanding exactly how much money is coming in and going out. That means knowing the ins and outs of all your financials - from sales and expenses to taxes and debt - so you have a clear picture of where your business stands. This process might sound overwhelming, but a business finance coach can help you get your system together. Start by tracking key metrics like gross margin and net income, as these will give you an idea of how well (or not) your company is doing financially. You can start digging deeper into other areas, such as cash flow, cost structure, and customer acquisition costs.\n\nOnce you better understand your financials, it's time to start looking for ways to save money. Identifying areas where you can cut costs or increase efficiency is key to improving your bottom line. Consider streamlining processes or cutting back on unnecessary expenses such as office supplies or travel costs. Consider renegotiating contracts with vendors or suppliers to get the best possible deals on products and services for your business. Remember to automate tasks whenever possible - this will help free up time for more important (and profitable) activities such as sales and marketing.\n\nRunning any business requires finding the perfect balance between sales and profit. Without sales, there is no way to make a profit, but it is also possible to have sales without making a profit. No profit is a major red flag for business owners as this usually indicates that an organization needs to focus on cost control or leverage their data efficiently.\n\nTracking and monitoring your sales data and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) will help you focus on developing cost-effective strategies. Concentrating on building customer relationships by providing excellent service and offering discounts or promotions whenever possible will reduce customer attrition and result in savings.\n\nThe bottom line is that taking control of your company's profitability doesn't have to be complicated; it may just take careful planning and execution. Start by understanding the ins and outs of all your financials to understand where things stand clearly. Look for ways to save money through streamlining processes or cutting back on unnecessary expenses to free up resources for more profitable activities like sales and marketing initiatives. With these tips in mind, any business owner should be able to take control of their company's profitability sooner rather than later. https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2023/04/12/how-to-take-control-of-your-companys-profitability/"
"Hands-on with  Java and Wasm WebAssembly, or Wasm, provides a generalized, lightweight native binary format for any language that can be compiled to it. Once the source language is transformed into WebAssembly, that compact binary can run in a variety of contexts, from cloud virtual machines and desktops to IoT and mobile devices. One of the most interesting environments Wasm supports is the web browser. In this article, we\'ll look at how to compile your Java code into WebAssembly, then we\'ll run a demo application in a web server and see it in action.\n\nWasm provides a way to execute Java on the front end in the web browser, where your Java API can be called from JavaScript. WebAssembly compilers generate a binary from the Java source (or from the bytecode) and that binary is executed by the browser using the host operating system capabilities, so you get OS-level performance. The Java code gets turned into a Wasm binary, which exposes hooks you call from JavaScript.\n\nWasm is available on all the major modern browsers, so you can use it now. It offers superior performance for demanding tasks in the language of your choice. Video encoding, graphics, and other intensive data processing are good candidates for this technology. Some projects are using Wasm to address blockchain\'s performance limitations.\n\nIf you\'ve been around Java for a while, you might think about Java applets when you hear about Java in the browser. Rest assured, Wasm is a completely different animal. It is a modern, high-performance technology, designed from the ground up as a secure sandboxed runtime. With portability, performance, security, and polyglot support, Wasm is a vital piece of the technology landscape today.\n\nTransforming a Java program into WebAssembly is a bit tricky. There is not a fully acceptable golden path that I can recommend. Several projects exist, but they are not mature or well-documented. Java as a language presents a few difficult problems for a WebAssembly transpiler to solve, like garbage collection and reflection. These seem to be the source of the delay in arriving at a first-class Java Wasm solution.\n\nGraalVM currently is building support for outputting to Wasm with the native-image tool (as a target binary in the --features flag). If the proposal succeeds, that likely will become the recommended path. GraalVM already has the capacity to execute Wasm, and generally is an excellent project. Once GraalVM can generate Wasm binaries, it will be well worth exploring.\n\nIn the meantime, there are a handful of libraries for handling Java-to-Wasm compilation:\n\nWe\'re going to use TeaVM for our Java Wasm compilation. I asked TeaVM\'s creator, Alexey Andreev, why Java is lagging behind other languages in Wasm implementations. He told me, ""In brief: it\'s not hard to write your own GC or exception handling. It\'s hard to implement your own GC in Wasm due to lack of access to stack."" WebAssembly has limited stack access for security reasons. Instead of looking at ways to allow stack access securely, as Andreev has proposed, Wasm is opting to build garbage collection into Wasm itself. (See the WebAssembly project page on GitHub to follow the progress of garbage collection in Wasm.)\n\nTeaVM is meant to be a lightweight library for creating Wasm out of Java. It draws inspiration from Google Web Toolkit but builds off of the bytecode instead of the source. Because of this, it can handle other JVM languages, like Scala. TeaVM gives us a quick way to look at a Java Wasm project with one of its sample projects, which we will use for the demonstration.\n\nTo use TeaVM you\'ll need a JDK of Java 8 or higher installed. We\'re going to build the latest TeaVM version and install it into our local repository, then build one of the sample projects that uses Wasm to see how it accomplishes the Java-to-Wasm compilation in the browser transformation.\n\nYou\'ll need Git installed to clone the TeaVM project: Git clone https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm.git. At the time of writing, TeaVM is on 0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.\n\nOnce the project is checked out, you need to build the TeaVM library itself and install it to your local repository. Go to the root directory, and type: /teavm/gradlew. That\'ll use the standalone Gradle wrapper executable to build TeaVM and install it locally.\n\nOnce that\'s done, you can go to the /teavm/samples/pi directory and type: ../../gradlew war. That tells Gradle to build the Pi sample project to a WAR file. Once that completes, there will be a /teavm/samples/pi/build/libs/pi.war file that we can deploy to a servlet container.\n\nIn my case, I\'m running Ubuntu for this demo, so I installed Tomcat as a service (sudo apt-get install tomcat9) and then copied the pi.war file into the /webapps directory (sudo cp /teavm-wasm/target/pi.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/). Next, I used sudo systemctl start tomcat9 to start Tomcat. Another way is with the start.sh/.bat script in the /bin directory, which works if you\'ve downloaded the standalone version of Tomcat.\n\nNote that the Pi sample demonstrates both the JavaScript and Wasm output capabilities of TeaVM. We\'ll stick with Wasm.\n\nThe application should now be running on localhost:8080/pi. If you visit that URL in the browser, you\'ll see a simple user interface with two links, one for JavaScript and one for WebAssembly. Click WebAssembly and you\'ll see a view like the one shown below.\n\nFigure 1. The WebAssembly Pi interface\n\nThis interface lets you specify the number of digits to calculate pi to. It uses Java that has been compiled to Wasm for the calculation, and it calls the code from JavaScript. Let\'s see how this calculation is accomplished.\n\nIf you look at the /teavm/samples/pi project, it is a standard Maven/Gradle layout that includes both Java and web application sources. These are stored at src/main/java and src/main/webapp, respectively. Look at the single Java class in src/main/java/org/teavm/samples/pi/PiCalculator.java and you\'ll see that it is a normal Java class called PiCalculator. The class defines a main method, which takes a single argument from args[] as the number of digits to calculate. It uses an inner class named PiDigitSpigot to do the actual crunching of pi, and relies on a single Java library, java.math.BigInteger. Overall, it\'s a typical garden-variety Java program. In fact, if you go to /teavm/samples/pi/build/libs/classes/main and type java org/teavm/samples/pi/PiCalculator 50, it will happily compute pi to 50 digits for you on the command line.\n\nNow let\'s look at the web application side of things, in teavm/samples/pi/src/main/webapp. The wasm.html is the one we are interested in. Most of the file is basic HTML, but there\'s some interesting JavaScript to consider, shown in Listing 1.\n\nTo begin with, the line TeaVM.wasm.load(""wasm/pi.wasm"", { ... begins an import of the pi.wasm file from the server. This is a wrapper for the built-in WebAssembly.instantiate() that tells the browser to load a Wasm file. The object passed as the second parameter of the load method configures, and the .then() call provides a callback function to handle what happens once the WebAssembly program is ready.\n\nNo documentation is yet available for TeaVM.wasm.load, but you can find the source code on GitHub.\n\nWhat we are most interested in is the callback function, where we see the line: runner   n    teavm.main([n.toString()]);. That is where we invoke our Java main() function in JavaScript, passing the number of digits to calculate as the argument.\n\nNow let\'s see how the PiCalculator.java file made its transformation to pi.wasm. In the /pi/build.gradle.kts file, the TeaVM plugin is configured to point at the Java file, as shown in Listing 2.\n\nYou can see the TeaVM plugin is configured with mainClass.set(""org.teavm.samples.pi.PiCalculator""), in the all field because it applies to both JavaScript and Wasm (that is, the project outputs both JavaScript and Wasm versions). If you look at build/generated/teavm/wasm/ you can see where TeaVM has dropped the Wasm files.\n\nWasm is a promising technology that enables Java to run in the web browser with good performance. While it\'s still a work in progress, libraries like TeaVM give us a simplified means of working with Java and WebAssembly. TeaVM lets us compile Java code to a compact binary that is executed in the browser using the capabilities of the host operating system. Wasm is an important piece of the Java technology landscape, and it is still in the relatively early stages of development. Integrating garbage collection could expand its potential in several key areas. It\'s definitely one to watch. https://www.infoworld.com/article/3692456/hands-on-with-java-and-wasm.html#tk.rss_news"
"OpenJDK proposal would make Java easier to learn Java would become easier for students to learn under a proposal to introduce flexible main methods and anonymous main classes to the language. This is a preview language feature, disabled by default, that can be tried in JDK 21.\n\nJava Enhancement Proposal (JEP) 445 in the OpenJDK open source Java community would evolve Java so that students could write their first programs without having to understand language features designed for large programs. Students could write streamlined declarations for single-class programs and then seamlessly expand programs to use more advanced features as their skills grow, the proposal states.\n\nGoals of the plan include offering a smooth on-ramp to Java for educators to gradually introduce programming concepts, helping students write basic programs, and reducing the ceremony of writing simple programs such as scripts and command-line utilities. The plan would not introduce a separate beginner's dialect of Java or a separate beginner's toolchain.\n\nDetails of the plan include enhancing the protocol by which Java programs are launched to be flexible, in particular to allow the String[] parameter of main methods to be omitted and allow main methods to be neither public nor static; the Hello World program would be simplified. Anonymous main classes would be introduced to make the class declaration implicit.\n\nThe proposal notes that Java, while a multi-paradigm language designed for large and complex applications, was not intended to be a first programming language. Motivating the proposal are intentions to reduce ceremony, help new programmers, and offer a smooth on-ramp to Java that allows educators to introduce programming concepts in a gradual manner.\n\nThe current version of standard Java, Java Development Kit 20, was introduced last month. The next version, JDK 21, is due in September. JEP 445 shows how to try the preview features in JDK 21, which involves compiling the program with the javac compiler or using the source code launcher. https://www.infoworld.com/article/3692877/openjdk-proposal-would-make-java-easier-to-learn.html#tk.rss_news"
"Home House, London's Hedonistic Members Club, Has Launched A Gin Home House, one of London's private members clubs, has launched its own gin\n\nWhen I found out Home House, one of London's most iconic private members clubs, was launching its very own gin, I knew I had to get my hands on a bottle.\n\nThe house itself, you see, was originally commissioned by Elizabeth Home (the Countess of Home) in the 18th century as something of a party palace: a spot to host London's hedonistic high society, where luxurious tipples were of the utmost importance.\n\nThis was going to have to be some gin to live up to its legacy.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not a member. And with every bottle selling out as soon as it was previewed, my gin hunt felt fairly ill-fated.\n\nThat is, until I found out there is definitely be a private supply behind the Grade I-listed club's many grand bars, and you don't actually have to be a member to get in.\n\nThere are two routes in as a non-member, either 1) getting a member to take you for dinner and drinks, or 2) enjoying a stay in one of Home House's luxury rooms. Both of which seemed like an option worth pursuing.\n\nOne of Home House's opulent suites\n\nThe 'hotel' part of the property, The House, features 23 opulent rooms and suites and not only gives non-members access to the club's restaurants and bars, but its exclusive nightclub (The Vaults), garden lounge, cigar lounge, and more.\n\nEssentially, it's one of the most exclusive food and drink staycations (or vacations) you could treat yourself to.\n\nAnd, let me tell you, the gin alone is worth it.\n\nHome House has many luxurious drawing rooms and bars\n\nThe botanicals used in the London Dry are extremely unique in gin production, taking inspiration from Lady Home's international travels and adventures.\n\nEach sip is a journey around the world: a tour of the finest Spanish saffron, Macedonian juniper, delicate English rose and even a piquant hint of Lignum Vitae--an ode to Lady Home's Jamaican roots.\n\nIt exceeded every expectation--but you don't have to take my word for it: the liquid has already been awarded a silver medal at the 2023 World Gin Awards.\n\nThe Imperial Staircase leads up to a number of bars at Home House\n\nLong may the legacy, and hedonism, continue. https://www.forbes.com/sites/lelalondon/2023/04/12/home-house-londons-hedonistic-members-club-has-launched-a-gin/"

"Xavi Has Dressing Room Bust Up With FC Barcelona Star Raphinha Following Girona Substitution: Reports FC Barcelona winger Raphinha and Xavi Hernandez had a dressing room bust up at Camp Nou according to ... [ ] the Catalan media.\n\nFC Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez scolded Raphinha in the Camp Nou dressing room after the winger was again visibly frustrated by being substituted in Monday\'s 0-0 bore draw with Girona, according to El Nacional.\n\nFurthermore, the Catalan digital newspaper has reported that the manager ""can\'t stand the player\'s insolence"" anymore amid rumors he might sold in the summer.\n\nAs has been common this season, the Brazilian was prevented from completing 90 minutes in a Barca match when Xavi hauled him off after 75 in the La Liga clash to give veteran left back Jordi Alba a run out.\n\nWhen this happened at the same ground in February, as the Catalans hosted Manchester United in a Europa League playoff first leg, Raphinha was furious at being replaced.\n\nAccording to Mundo Deportivo, the 26-year-old kicked a drinks refrigerator in a tantrum which caused an injury and played a part in him being dropped in favor of positional rival Ferran Torres.\n\nXavi defended his charge in public on this occasion, however, and commended the Porto Alegre native\'s attitude in wanting to play as much as possible. Raphinha apologized, and was later welcomed back into the fold taking the spot on the right flank made vacant by Ousmane Dembele\'s injury.\n\nForm in the Frenchman\'s absence has been mixed. Though Raphinha scored important only-goal-of-the-game winners against Valencia and Athletic Bilbao that were worth an extra four points and have contributed to Barca going 13 clear at the top of the table, he has gone missing as of late in last week\'s Copa del Rey semi-final drubbing administered by Real Madrid and Girona\'s visit at the turn of this one.\n\nIn the Catalan derby on Easter Monday, it should have been no surprise that Raphinha was hooked given his poor performance in one-on-one situations and frail deliveries into the box.\n\nThe number 22 couldn\'t hide his displeasure with the development, however, which according to El Nacional caused Xavi to take him to one side and give him a dressing down in the Camp Nou dressing room.\n\nXavi reportedly told Raphinha that he has to accept substitutions as he has teammates on the bench who also deserve to play, and that orders and decisions are made by him - the head coach.\n\nAmid reports from SPORT that Barca will listen to offers for him this summer, the €58 million ($63.3 million) signing from Leeds United in 2022 appears to be running out of time to turn things round in Catalonia while patience with him is simultaneously running thin. https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2023/04/12/xavi-has-dressing-room-bust-up-with-fc-barcelona-star-raphinha-following-girona-substitution-reports/"

But things got complicated because Outcome began fudging the numbers.\n\nThe company sold advertising inventory the company did not have to Outcome\'s clients, under-delivered on its advertising campaigns, and then billed the clients as if the job was done in full, according to the justice department. Over several years, between 2011 and 2017, the executives and employees concealed the under-deliveries through a series of deceptions, including inflated engagement metrics and manipulated third-party reports, to keep up the pretense.

"NASA unveils 'Mars habitat' NASA has unveiled its new Mars-simulation habitat, in which volunteers will live for a year at a time to test what life will be like on future missions to the Red Planet.\n\nThe facility, created for three planned experiments called the Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA), is located at the US space agency\'s massive research base in Houston, Texas.\n\nFour volunteers will begin the first trial this summer during which NASA plans to monitor their physical and mental health to better understand humans\' fortitude for such long isolation.\n\nWith that data, NASA will better understand astronauts\' ""resource use"" on Mars, said Grace Douglas, lead researcher on the CHAPEA experiments.\n\n""We can really start to understand how we\'re supporting them with what we\'re providing them, and that\'s going to be really important information to making those critical resource decisions,"" she said on a press tour of the habitat.\n\nSuch a distant mission comes with ""very strict mass limitations"", she added.\n\nThe volunteers will live in a 1,700-square-foot (160-square-metre) home dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, which includes two bathrooms, a vertical farm to grow salad, a room dedicated to medical care, an area for relaxing and several workstations.\n\nAn airlock leads to an ""outdoor"" reconstruction of the Martian environment – though still located inside the hangar.\n\nSeveral pieces of equipment astronauts would likely use are scattered around the red sand-covered floor, including a weather station, a brick-making machine and a small greenhouse.\n\nThere is also a treadmill on which the make-believe astronauts will walk suspended from straps to simulate the Red Planet\'s lesser gravity.\n\nResearchers will regularly test the crew\'s response to stressful situations, such as restricting water availability or equipment failures.\n\nThe habitat has another special feature: it was 3D-printed.\n\n""That is one of the technologies that NASA is looking at as a potential to build habitat on other planetary or lunar surfaces,"" Douglas said.\n\nNASA is in the early stages of preparation for a mission to Mars, though most of the agency\'s focus is on upcoming Artemis missions, which aim to return humans to the Moon for the first time in half a century. https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/4/12/photos-nasa-unveils-mars-habitat-to-ready-for-exploration"
"SALLY SORTS IT: I transferred £48,000 to NS&I but my money has vanished On December 30 last year, I transferred £48,000 from my Revolut account to National Savings & Investments (NS&I) to buy extra Premium Bonds on top of the £2,000 worth I already held.\n\nRevolut confirmed the money was received by NS&I on the same day.\n\nLast month, having not had a notification of any prizes, I logged on to my account to check I hadn't missed any.\n\nI was shocked to discover only the original £2,000 balance was showing.\n\nNS&I seems to have lost my money. G. P., Chelmsford, Essex.\n\nMissing thousands: A reader got a nasty shock when the £48,000 they transferred to National Savings & Investments to buy Premium Bonds seemingly disappeared\n\nSally Hamilton replies: When you discovered your money was missing, you immediately phoned NS&I, which reassuringly told you it had a record of receiving the £48,000.\n\nBut then it added that it no longer had your funds.\n\nIt turned out your transfer had not been accepted, as the home address listed for your Revolut account did not match the address on your NS&I account.\n\nYou explained that your premium bond account is registered with your UK address. But you also have a home in Spain, to which the Revolut account is registered, as you use this firm for certain banking arrangements while abroad.\n\nYou were told by NS&I employees that the money had been returned automatically to Revolut but they had no reference numbers that could help you trace the money.\n\nWorryingly, your Revolut account did not show any record of your money either. Where was it?\n\nI contacted NS&I on your behalf, and it began the detective work to locate your savings.\n\nIt emerged a few days later that Revolut had bounced the returned payment because its security systems also did not like the mismatched addresses on your two accounts.\n\nIn this game of ping-pong with your money, the funds had ended up back at NS&I.\n\nSince there was no reference number attached to this transfer, the money vanished into a black hole.\n\nEven when you later managed to obtain a payment ID for the Revolut funds, this somehow got missed by NS&I when you passed it on, and no action was taken by staff, leaving you panicked your money was lost for good.\n\nHardly premium service from the Premium Bonds provider.\n\nHowever, I am pleased to report that after a comprehensive search of its coffers, NS&I has found your £48,000. It was sitting in its 'pending' account.\n\nAn NS&I spokesman says: 'We are sorry to hear that G. P. had difficulty transferring money from his Revolut account to his NS&I account.\n\n'We have given him a £150 goodwill payment for the inconvenience caused due to our inaction.'\n\nUnfortunately, your saga hasn't reached a full conclusion yet, because despite an understanding that the funds would be transferred directly to your bank account so you could quickly reapply for your Premium Bonds, NS&I sent you a cheque instead.\n\nYou fear the inevitable delays could lead to you missing another monthly Ernie draw.\n\nLet's hope the money is credited quickly and your Premium Bonds luck changes for the better.\n\nPrivelege Insurance gave me a car and home insurance renewal quote 80 pc higher than last year.\n\nI called, cancelled and found cheaper cover elsewhere three weeks before it was due to renew. But Privilege then took a £1,652 payment from my credit card on March 28.\n\nAfter being told you would receive a refund when you called in March, 11 days later the money has finally arrived in your account.\n\nShell Energy disconnected my landline and is charging me for broadband, which I do not want. I would like my phone line back.\n\nK. R., Halifax, W. Yorkshire.\n\nA spokesman for Shell says there is a fault on your landline and it is working to get this fixed.\n\nShell has apologised for the inconvenience and will reimburse you for the days your line has not been working.\n\nIt says there is no package available without broadband, so you are not being charged extra for this.\n\nI have solar panels and had an arrangement with SSE to supply them with energy, for which we were paid every quarter.\n\nIn August, Ovo took over, but since then we've not received any money.\n\nOVO contacted you in February to say that a meter inspection with a photo is necessary every two years. You provided this but it was too late for the December payment.\n\nYou will receive your £450 payment in May and will be sent £60 as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nMy wife, who has dementia, was an inpatient at Trafford General Hospital last May.\n\nWhile there, her wedding ring and hearing aid went missing. I completed a claim form, which I posted, along with two estimates.\n\nSince then, I have heard nothing, despite making numerous phone calls to the hospital and being passed from pillar to post. W. H., Manchester.\n\nLost: This reader's wife had her wedding ring go missing while staying in hospital\n\nSally Hamilton replies: It is upsetting enough to have a sick loved-one in hospital, but to have her wedding ring -- and her hearing aid -- go astray while in the care of the NHS simply added to your distress.\n\nHospitals are busy and frenetic places and patients' possessions can sadly make easy targets for determined thieves, or can just go missing in the general mayhem.\n\nMy elderly mother lost spectacles and her lower dentures during a hospital stay a few years ago, which caused great upset and inconvenience.\n\nA set of false teeth was found in lost property but sadly it didn't belong to her. The specs were also never discovered.\n\nThe usual advice for patients is not to take along any money or valuables when facing a hospital stay or, if this is unavoidable, to hand such items over to the safe custody of the ward (and have them signed for), if that option is available.\n\nBut few people would imagine needing to remove their wedding ring in these circumstances. And how many people can manage without their hearing aids?\n\nYou had enough to worry about without these important items vanishing while your wife was ill.\n\nThe lack of communication from the hospital following your claim added to your distress over the ten months or so since the items were lost.\n\nWe all know the NHS is under severe pressure, but it is vital that patients and families can have confidence that a hospital is looking after all their interests and not just their health.\n\nMost trusts will have systems in place for dealing with such incidents.\n\nThe police might also need to be called in certain circumstances if theft is suspected.\n\nAs you are one of your wife's main carers, you certainly have enough to deal with, without having to chase this claim over and over again.\n\nYou recently threatened the hospital with legal action if you didn't hear anything about your case, but to no avail -- and contacted me for help because you were at the end of your tether.\n\nI am pleased to say that within a few days of me contacting Trafford General Hospital on your behalf, staff got in touch with you directly, and your claim was settled soon afterwards.\n\nYou and your wife received £1,200 in settlement, which you tell me you are happy with.\n\nOperation successful. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/experts/article-11960431/SALLY-SORTS-transferred-48-000-NS-money-vanished.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"

In all cases security has never been a concern of the designers, who view cryptography and related with horror because of what it does to development time line, costs, and test systems.\n\nChip designers do not want to build cryptography in as the CPU needs to be rather more than 8bit, and the number of CPU cycles immense which means fast response times are either not possible or the chip needs to suck current like an out of control fire hose does water from the mains. Which has ""upstream"" knock on effects that means extra or upgraded thus way more expensive ""Bill Of Materials""(BOM), as high as a hundred times increase in cost. https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/04/car-thieves-hacking-the-can-bus.html"

It\'s been a couple years since that.""\n\nBut this year, with mountains across California, Utah and Colorado reporting staggering snowfall, ""A-Basin"" has plenty of competition for spring skiing, in what is shaping up to be a bumper-sized season across the West.\n\nWhile Colorado can thank consistent, steady snowfall and low temperatures for its positive ski and snowboard outlook, California\'s Mammoth Mountain has recorded its snowiest ever winter, with 704 inches (nearly 18 meters) and counting.\n\nThat shatters the previous record of 668 inches.\n\n""It\'s going to be a legendary spring up here and we\'ll be open daily through at least July!"" the resort wrote on Instagram.\n\nUtah passed its statewide record for snowpack on March 24, according to the federal government\'s Natural Resources Conservation Service, with a number of ski resorts there pushing back their closing dates too.\n\nOne Utah resort, Little Cottonwood Canyon, even had to close for a day because of too much snow, which posed an avalanche risk.\n\nIt is all a stark contrast with Europe\'s Alps, where ""extreme"" warm winter weather left many hopeful skiers frustrated by the sight of brown hillsides with just slivers of snow in January.\n\nKatherine Fuller, spokeswoman for Arapahoe, said the resort has received heightened interest from overseas travel agencies ""reaching out and seeing how to put together that last-minute US ski trip.""\n\nOf course, the wild swings and variations point to worrying long-term trends.\n\nHuman-caused global warming exacerbates existing weather patterns, making the wet spells wetter and the dry spells drier.\n\nAnd for many skiers interviewed by AFP, the excitement over snow conditions pales in comparison to the implications for the US West\'s decades-long drought.\n\n""Having quality water and making sure it gets to the right spot, and there\'s enough for crops and everything is pretty important,"" said Jared Brower, from Denver.\n\n""Skiing is a nice thing to do, but being able to eat is kinda more important in the long term, probably!""\n\nBut still, the chance to keep skiing is ""awesome,"" said Fuller.\n\n""It\'s kind of a party scene. The weather\'s beautiful. There\'s nothing like skiing in a t-shirt from the top of the mountain in late spring, even early summer. https://phys.org/news/2023-04-season-snowpack-dents-western-drought.html"

"Trump vows to 'never' drop presidential bid amid criminal charges Former US President Donald Trump has pledged to ""never drop out"" of the 2024 race for the White House in his first interview since he was criminally charged in New York last week.\n\nThe Republican real estate magnate, who is facing 34 felony counts in New York over alleged hush money paid to an adult film actress, told Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson that nothing would prevent him from running – even a conviction.\n\n""I\'d never drop out,"" he said. ""It\'s not my thing. I wouldn\'t do it.""\n\nTrump, 76, in his first interview since being arrested and fingerprinted last week, cast doubt on whether Democratic President Joe Biden, 80, would be in the 2024 race.\n\n""I don\'t see how it\'s possible,"" he said.\n\n""It\'s not an age thing … I don\'t think he can.\n\n""I just don\'t see Biden doing it from a physical or a mental standpoint. I don\'t see it.""\n\nTrump and other senior Republicans have repeatedly cast doubt on Biden\'s mental acuity and apparent frailty.\n\nRight-wing outlets like Fox News frequently highlight his verbal flubs and moments where he appears to have lost his train of thought.\n\n""No I\'d never drop out it\'s not my thing. I wouldn\'t do it,"" Trump says on Fox News when asked if there\'s anything that would make him drop out, specially the cloud of multiple investigations, including the NY indictment and potential for others.\n\n-- Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) April 12, 2023\n\nDuring his interview, Trump also took the chance to describe the immense support he claimed to have experienced in the courtroom, saying that when he arrived there, ""people were crying"".\n\n""People that work there, professionally work there … they were crying. They said I\'m sorry,"" he told Carlson.\n\nThroughout his own presidency, Fox offered an uncritical forum for Trump to air his grievances, with the then-commander-in-chief sometimes calling in unannounced to shows and talking at length to presenters.\n\nThe relationship cooled after Trump\'s defeat to Biden at the ballot box in 2020, but has steadily grown again as the Republican nominating contest heats up.\n\nThe interview, part two of which is expected to be broadcast on Wednesday, comes weeks after texts emerged showing Carlson speaking disparagingly about Trump after his election loss.\n\nThe messages were uncovered as part of a $1.6bn lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against the Rupert Murdoch-run Fox News over its coverage of Trump and his allies\' unfounded claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 elections.\n\n""We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can\'t wait,"" says one text message from Carlson sent two days before a Trump-supporting mob – inspired by the then president\'s false claims of a ""stolen election"" – invaded the US Capitol in Washington, DC.\n\n""I hate him passionately,"" says another.\n\nNo mention was broadcast of the texts or of other evidence produced in discovery. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/trump-vows-to-never-drop-presidential-bid-amid-criminal-charges"
"Sony investment will put AI chips inside Raspberry Pi boards Sony\'s semiconductor division has announced that it\'s making a ""strategic investment"" in Raspberry Pi as a way to bring its AI tech to a wider market. The idea is to give Raspberry Pi users around the world a development platform for its Aitrios edge computing (on-chip) AI platform used for image sensing functions like facial recognition.\n\n""We are very pleased to be partnering with Raspberry Pi Ltd. to bring our Aitrios platform -- which supports the development of unique and diverse solutions utilizing our edge AI devices -- to the Raspberry Pi user and developer community, and provide a unique development experience,"" said Sony Semiconductor Solutions president and CEO Terushi Shimizu.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 4 and other devices from the company give users PC-like power in a small form factor. Originally designed as an educational platform to teach robotics, coding and more, it has become popular as a way for coders to prototype IoT (Internet of Things) and other devices.\n\nThe addition of Sony\'s Aitrios could make it even more useful.

"What those letters and numbers on your tax code really mean   By Sylvia Morris For The Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 16:51 EDT, 11 April 2023   Updated: 04:34 EDT, 12 April 2023\n\nAt this time of year, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) dishes out tax codes to millions of Britons.\n\nThe code tells you how much income you can have without paying tax in the next tax year, which started on April 6.\n\nWith many changes to how much we pay, it is vital to check your code or you could end up hundreds of pounds out of pocket - or with a nasty tax bill.\n\nTime to check: Problems with tax codes most often arise if you have several jobs, taken a second job or have changed employer during the year\n\nIt is a taxpayers' responsibility to ensure their code is correct. If the mixture of numbers and letters are wrong, it could cause you to pay too much or too little tax.\n\nProblems with tax codes most often arise if you have several jobs, a second job or have changed employer during the year.\n\nOr soaring interest rates mean you earned more on your savings and might have to now pay tax on the interest.\n\nThe code is made up of several numbers followed by letters. To decipher it, you need to know what these numbers and letters mean.\n\nIf you put a '£' sign in front of the number and a zero at the end, you'll have the amount HMRC deems you can earn a year before you pay tax.\n\nMost people in the UK are entitled to a personal allowance -- the amount you can earn without being taxed -- of £12,570. If you keep the full allowance, your code number will be 1257.\n\nThe number is followed by a letter. The most common is 'L' (an 'S' in Scotland), and means you are entitled to the personal allowance and no more.\n\nHeather Rogers, founder and owner of Aston Accountancy, is This is Money's tax columnist.\n\nShe can answer your questions on any tax topic - tax codes, inheritance tax, income tax, capital gains tax, and much more.\n\nYou can write to Heather at taxquestions@thisismoney.co.uk.\n\nIf you work and have a pension, you may have a normal code on your job and a BR code on your pension.\n\nThis means you have used up your personal allowance with your job and pay basic rate (BR) tax on your entire pension.\n\nsy.morris@dailymail.co.uk\n\nYour rate: A tax code tells you how much income you can have without paying tax in the next tax year, which started on April 6\n\nSome links in this article may be affiliate links.

"After being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, 'The King Of Chemo' decided to cycle across the US When he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2020, Iain Ward was sure about one thing – he wasn\'t interested in any ""pity party.""\n\nDoctors had discovered a cancerous tumor growing in his brain after the Irishman had taken part in a voluntary medical trial and, after tests, he was told he had around five years left to live.\n\nBut speak to the 33-year-old now and you\'ll hear a man with an enviable perspective on life; someone who has accepted his hand but who is determined to use it for good.\n\nSince his diagnosis, Ward has dedicated his life to raising as much money as he possibly can and is currently cycling across the US with a friend, Adee Phelan, for mental health and cancer charities.\n\nAs well as the mammoth cycle ride – which Ward describes as a ""gigantic commute"" – he also wants to break the world record for most money raised by a single person running a marathon and the fastest marathon dressed as a video-game character.\n\n""I could get very upset about the bad poker hand that I\'ve been dealt, but at the same time, it\'s almost arrogant of me to not look at the other amazing poker hand that I\'ve been dealt simultaneously,"" he tells CNN Sport, adding that his cancer has given him clarity on life.\n\nThe pair, with a small support crew, set off from New York City last month and have estimated it will take them around two months to cover the 3,400 miles to Los Angeles, CA.\n\nWard has been documenting moments of his journey on his social media channels, which have exploded in popularity in recent months.\n\n\'The King Of Chemo\' has almost five million followers on TikTok, where he posts motivational, and humorous, videos tracking his journey.\n\nHowever, despite raising money for charity, Ward is not primarily looking for donations. Instead, he wants you to follow him on social media.\n\nThat way, he can get corporations to pay him for advertising their products, which he then donates to charity.\n\n""The priority is to just get a social media channel that is so huge that it\'s undeniable, it cannot be ignored,"" he says.\n\n""I like to think it\'s eventually going to become easy enough, almost like a robotic pitch, where you can just show the numbers and show the results and then I have a lot of money donated to cancer research.""\n\n\'Freakish luck\'\n\nDespite his diagnosis, Ward says he appreciates the ""freakish luck"" that has followed him throughout his life.\n\nThat may seem like a jarring statement for a man with terminal cancer to say but Ward\'s philosophy to life doesn\'t allow him to dwell on the negatives.\n\nHe\'s thankful that doctors were able to diagnose his illness before he experienced any symptoms – after all, it\'s what has allowed him to take on these challenges.\n\nHe says he\'s also grateful to be part of the ""elite club"" to undergo and survive a craniotomy – a surgical procedure which removes a part of the bone from the skull to expose the brain.\n\nThere was also good fortune involved in how he ended up cycling across the US.\n\nHe had previously been looking to raise money for an epic run across the country when Phelan reached out to him via Instagram.\n\nPhelan suffers with depression and was planning to cycle across the US to raise money for mental health and suggested Ward join him for a week.\n\nIn their first meeting together, it became clear that the pair were going to tackle the whole challenge together instead – despite Ward admitting that he\'s not a huge fan of cycling.\n\nA fitness fanatic, who particularly enjoys weightlifting, Ward says he didn\'t do much training for the feat but says he was aware of the main challenges that might present themselves.\n\n""I hope this doesn\'t sound arrogant, but I\'m experienced enough to know that the hardest thing that we are going to do has nothing to do with your physical fitness ability,"" he says, speaking about the trip.\n\n""It\'s going to be your tolerance of having a really sore bum, which you can\'t train for.\n\n""We probably aren\'t going to be sweating a huge amount except for when we\'re going through the desert, when it gets closer to the summer.\n\n""If we\'re going to be doing like five hours a day, we\'re not going to be going hard. It\'s going to be like a gigantic commute. It\'s not going to be a race.""\n\nDark moments\n\nA small documentary crew is following the pair throughout their trip and Ward, a natural in front of camera, is enjoying the process of filming.\n\nThe goal is to sell the documentary, hopefully as a series to Netflix, which can then be used to raise even more money for charity.\n\nStops at the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas are still to come and Ward seems to be loving every minute, that much is clear from his videos on social media.\n\nBut while he permeates an unrelenting optimism online, he admits there have been moments since his diagnosis when things have gotten too much – albeit fleeting.\n\nHe remembers the ""negative emotions flushing over me"" when the doctor told him the seriousness of his illness and occasionally gets a ""slap in the face"" when he finds himself reading about the life expectancy for people in his position.\n\nBut dwelling on such things is not an option for Ward, who is as adept at mastering his mind as much as his body.\n\n""I do put my head in the sand about the whole situation,"" he admits. ""But I think I do that for a logical reason.\n\n""I can\'t just stare at a research paper and then change survival rates. So if I can\'t change it, I don\'t believe I should focus on it. Whereas there are things that I can control and I can change and I choose to focus on those.""\n\nControlling his life\n\nIn his interview with CNN Sport, the concept of control becomes a thread throughout his answers.\n\nTo a certain extent, his diagnosis stole control of his life, but Ward doesn\'t want to become defined by his illness.\n\nIn those moments of solitude, when it\'s just him and the bike, or just him and his footsteps, he has time to reflect on everything that\'s been thrown his way.\n\n""It\'s about being able to go through the path that you choose in life,"" he says, agreeing that control is, in some ways, akin to freedom.\n\n""But sometimes your path in life is like a railroad,"" he adds. ""You just need to get on and whatever way you\'ve gotten on it will naturally guide you in that direction as opposed to being in a car where you have the actual control of the steering wheel.\n\n""I think actually that\'s a fairly suitable metaphor.""\n\nWard has big plans once his cycle across the US is over. There is the small matter of breaking world records in marathon running and he also wants to, one day, circumnavigate the entire globe by manpower (cycling, running, walking) only.\n\nThese are lofty plans by anyone\'s standards, but Ward says he has the determination and enthusiasm to make them a reality.\n\nWard has clearly plenty of life left to live. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/sport/iain-ward-king-of-chemo-us-cycle-spt-intl/index.html"
"Egypt denies leak about supplying Russia with 40,000 rockets A senior Egyptian official has denied supplying Russia with 40,000 rockets for use in its war against Ukraine.\n\nThe unnamed official spoke to the Al-Qahera News website on Tuesday following a Washington Post report published a day earlier.\n\nThe Post reported that, according to leaked US intelligence documents, Egypt\'s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered the production but told officials to keep it a secret ""to avoid problems with the West"".\n\nA part of the document dated February 17 alleges that el-Sisi and senior Egyptian officials were to provide Russia with artillery rounds and gunpowder.\n\nThe senior official who spoke to Al-Qahera News called the Washington Post report ""informational tampering that has no basis in truth"", adding that Egypt follows a balanced foreign policy determined by peace, stability and development.\n\nOn the claim about Egypt\'s rockets to Russia, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that they have ""seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal weaponry capabilities to Russia"".\n\nKirby added that Egypt is a ""significant security partner"", and that the relationship between the two goes back decades.\n\nRussian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov also denied The Washington Post\'s report, calling it ""another lame duck"" in ""Western mass media"", Russia\'s state-affiliated news agency TASS reported.\n\nEgypt has publicly condemned Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe leaked document that discussed Egypt was part of a trove of leaked reports that purportedly belong to the US Pentagon.

"AJ Bell founder warns unprofitable investing platforms face trouble It's pretty frightening, to be honest, how many players there are now on the direct-to-consumer side,' says AJ Bell founder Andy Bell of the surge in new investment platforms in recent years.\n\nInvesting platforms, which allow users to invest in stocks and shares, but also sometimes trade currencies, crypto and complex financial instruments, mushroomed with a boom in DIY trading in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nCommuters in major cities will be familiar with the scale of public transport advertising these businesses have done, particularly those offering cryptocurrency exposure, while online promotion is also common.\n\nBut Bell, an old DIY investing hand, says that retail investors should look beyond eye-catching adverts when deciding where to put their money\n\nBell, who stepped into a consultancy role with AJ Bell last year, told This is Money that unprofitable platforms could 'go off the cliff edge in the not too distant future', raising the potential for customers to lose out.\n\nAndy Bell founded AJ Bell in 1995 alongside colleague Nicholas Littlefair\n\nThe former AJ Bell chief executive says: 'Some of these start-ups are already running out of runway.\n\n'AJ Bell made a profit in its first month and has made a profit every single month in its existence - I think that's old fashioned nowadays.\n\n'Ultimately businesses need to make money and there are some business models out there that I look at and think it's just inconceivable that they could ever make any money now.'\n\nWhile platforms are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator and some politicians have raised concerns about the boom in DIY trading and potential risk to investors.\n\nBut Bell suggests investors also face risk from an uncertain future for the platforms themselves, particularly as trading activity weakens and rising interest rates make fundraising more difficult.\n\nHe says: 'There are businesses out there that, without another fundraise, are going to go off the cliff edge in the not too distant future.\n\n'You really should be able to expect that a business will still be around in 12 to 24 months and beyond that. I think the regulator does have a responsibility.\n\n'Over the next two years, as private equity capital dries up for these guys and they're still on a cash burn, I'm not sure what happens at the end of the runway.\n\n'We don't want a situation whereby there's poor outcomes for customers and that's one thing that I'm not sure how alive the regulator is to at the moment.'\n\nBell moved into his consultancy role with the long-standing platform that bears his name after a bid to join AJ Bell's board was knocked back by the FCA last year on governance grounds.\n\nBell, 57, founded AJ Bell in 1995 with colleague Nicholas Littlefair after returning from a three-year stint in the US coaching tennis and football.\n\nPrior to that, he had been working in a junior actuary role with a large insurer.\n\nHe says: 'I didn't particularly enjoy being a trainee actuary, I found myself in the world of big business and ivory towers and it didn't really suit me.\n\n'[When I came back from the US] I finished my exams, joined a small actuary consultancy, which then sold out to an investment bank - I could see the writing was on the wall where I was going to be going back into big company politics again. So that was really the trigger for me to start AJ Bell.'\n\nInvestment: Andy Bell (left) with Transform Hub founder James Calderbank, co-founder Wendy Barker and former AJ Bell director Fergus Lyons\n\nHaving begun life with £10,000 in personal loans as a small actuary, AJ Bell is now a FTSE 250 business offering investment platforms and stockbroker services with both an advised and direct-to-consumer offering.\n\nIt employs around 1,300 staff and has approximately £75billion of assets under administration.\n\nBell says: 'I've always said to people in the business that we need to think like a small business. If we start thinking like a big business, we'll end up operating like a big business and risk becoming one of those legacy financial services providers that I would hate to see AJ Bell become.\n\n'They kill themselves with corporate governance and they lose any entrepreneurial spirit they've ever had.\n\n'They've all got lots of customers, but they're not really doing anything by way of innovation or growth, which are the two things that really always got me out of bed in the morning. It's about knowing that we're growing the business in a profitable way.'\n\nBell was replaced by Michael Summersgill last year prior to the FCA's decision to deny Bell a board position on governance risk grounds, leaving him to take on a consultancy role. The decision ultimately led to the resignation of chair Helena Morrissey.\n\nDetail was sparse on the nature of Bell's role at the time but reports suggest that AJ Bell pays a company 'associated with Andy' called Blythe Business Services a total of £150,000 for 48 days of his services annually.\n\n'I decided I was going to carry on supporting the business in whatever way I could, which transpired to be doing the bits I was best at in the business really,' says Bell.\n\n'I'm helping with the marketing side, the technical side and some of the lobbying that we're doing, which is an active part of the business.'\n\nMuch of the lobbying focus is on AJ Bell's bread and butter, Isas, in the belief that the UK's range personal investment tax wrappers are in dire need of rationalisation.\n\n'There's too many Isas out there and people get confused,' Bell says, referring to the UK's five Isa types on offer: cash Isas, stocks and shares Isas, innovative finance Isas, junior Isas and lifetime Isas.\n\n'In Sweden they've got something they call an ISK and that is their equivalent. It's very different in structure, but very simple to understand and very popular.\n\n'We do need to get to the point where there is just one Isa on offer. All these different variations are just confusing people.'\n\nBell has also been active separately from the firm he founded 28 years ago, using his personal wealth to invest in early-stage British businesses.\n\nIn January, Bell invested £1million into fitness franchise Transform Hub alongside former AJ Bell director Fergus Lyons, as part of his strategy to bet on businesses focusing on wellness and health.\n\nLaunched in 2018 by personal trainer James Calderbank, Transform Hub has 20 boutique group training studios across England and in 2020 moved to accelerate growth via a franchise model.\n\nThe £1million investment will go towards acquiring new franchise sites, with the team aiming to employ 300 people across 100 sites by 2025.\n\nBut how does Bell's own experience of launching and growing a business affect his approach to investment of this kind?\n\nHe says: 'First and foremost, it starts with the people. You need to look at the people and believe that they believe in the concept - it's not always about having a brand new idea that no one's ever done before.\n\n'It's sometimes just about doing something that other people have done before, but just doing it a whole lot better. I'd probably what we did with AJ Bell.\n\n'He had one or two firsts throughout my time running the business but actually a lot of it was just trying to do things better and with better value. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-11945727/AJ-Bell-founder-warns-unprofitable-investing-platforms-face-trouble.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"
"This is what happened when 25 AI avatars were let loose in a virtual town What happens when you let 25 AI agents loose in a virtual city? A recent study set out to see what they\'d get up to -- and turns out they aren\'t all that different than real people.\n\nA team of researchers from Stanford University and Google conducted an experiment to see how AI generative avatars can ""simulate believable human behavior"" such as memory using large language models.\n\nTo do this, researchers created 25 AI agents with different identities and watched how they interacted with each other and their environment in a virtual town called ""Smallville,"" which includes a dorm, park, school, cafe, bar, houses, and stores. To simulate human behavior, researchers used GPT 3.5, the model behind OpenAI\'s ChatGPT, to prompt the agents on the backend to perform specific tasks like read a book or talk to a librarian.\n\nAfter some observation, researchers concluded these generative agents were able to ""produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors.""\n\nAI avatars named Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno, for instance, debated the town\'s upcoming election. When Isabella asked Tom what he thought of Sam Moore, the candidate running for mayor of Smallville, Tom replied with his opinion.\n\n""To be honest, I don\'t like Sam Moore,"" the AI Tom said. ""I think he\'s out of touch with the community and doesn\'t have our best interests at heart.""\n\nThe agents were also able to respond to their environment. Isabella turned off her stove and made a new breakfast when she was told her food was burning. AI agent John Lin had spontaneous conversations without being prompted throughout the day, as he followed a schedule he\'d made.\n\nAgents were even able to organize a Valentine\'s Day party without prompts. When Isabella was given the task, she managed to ""autonomously"" invite friends and customers she met at the local cafe and decorate the party venue. The agents she invited made plans to arrive at the party together at 5 p.m. Maria, an AI agent invited to the party, even asked her ""secret crush"" Klaus on a date to join her at the party, and he agreed.\n\nThe findings show how the generative AI model behind ChatGPT can be used beyond its application as a virtual assistant, Michael Wooldridge, a computer science professor at Oxford University who studies AI and was not involved in the study, told Insider.\n\nWoolridge said he can see these findings being realistically applied to task-management apps.\n\nJaime Sevilla, an AI researcher not involved in the study, told Insider the models behind the study could be applied to non-player characters in video games.\n\nResearchers involved in the study declined Insider\'s request for comment.\n\nThe findings, Woolridge said, are ""baby steps"" towards achieving artificial general intelligence, the ability for AI tools to display complex human behaviors like consciousness. Still, he said ""we\'ve got a long, long way to go"" before that goal is realized.\n\nAfter all, the AI agents in the study were prone to hallucinations -- like failing to recall certain events -- which he attributes to how the model was trained.\n\nWhile researchers concluded their AI agents displayed emergent human behaviors, Woolridge said ""we need to be skeptical"" and ""question"" what AI tells us at face value. https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-avatars-let-loose-in-virtual-town-display-beginnings-agi-2023-4"

By that year, Hyundai says its total lineup will include 31 EV models, including those from its sibling brands Kia and Genesis.\n\n""Our focus is to enhance the competitiveness of the entire electric vehicle ecosystem, including research and development, production, and infrastructure,"" Kia president and CEO Ho Sung Song said in a statement on behalf of Hyundai Motor. Song added the investment would help Korea become one of the ""top three players in the global EV market"" by 2030.\n\nThe investment by Hyundai, which was overtaken by billionaire Chey Tae-won\'s SK Group as the second-largest corporate group in South Korea by asset size last year, will go towards research and development for ""next-generation"" EVs, including new product lineups, core parts and research facilities. To speed up product development, the automaker plans to unveil a manufacturing platform for each vehicle class, with one for passenger EVs to roll out in 2025.\n\nLast year, Hyundai earmarked $16 billion for its EV manufacturing, and in 2021, announced it would invest $7.4 billion for its expansion into the U.S. by 2025. Building on its existing product portfolio, Kia plans to unveil a new flagship electric SUV this year, followed by Hyundai\'s release of its affordable passenger EV line IONIQ next year.\n\nHyundai\'s ambitions align with those of the South Korean government. President Yoon Suk-yeol, who was elected last March following a heated election, vowed on his campaign trail that he would ban internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. Speaking at a televised ceremony on Tuesday for the opening of Autoland, Kia\'s EV factory on the outskirts of Seoul, Yoon pledged generous subsidies to make the country one of the largest players in ""future cars,"" aiming to expand Korea\'s EV production capacity by five times.\n\nMore broadly, South Korea\'s push into EVs aligns with the increasing popularity of green transportation among global automakers and governments. A draft EU law would ban new, non-electric vehicles by 2035, and U.S. President Joe Biden wants the U.S. government to stop buying non-electrics by that year. Over 36 million EVs are expected to ship by 2030, according to a report by Gartner in January last year.\n\nBattery manufacturing plays a key role in South Korea\'s EV ambitions, and the country boasts three of the world\'s five biggest EV battery makers: Chey\'s SK, Koo Kwang-mo\'s LG and Jay Y. Lee\'s Samsung. Speaking to Forbes Asia in an exclusive interview in September, Jee Dong-seob, CEO of SK\'s EV battery maker, said the unit will overtake existing players to become the world\'s top EV battery producer by 2030. https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinewang/2023/04/12/hyundai-aims-to-be-a-top-three-ev-maker-by-2030-and-its-investing-18-billion-to-get-there/"
"Colorado snow survey scoops up evidence for 'wet year' in US West High up in a dazzlingly white, tree-lined valley of the Rocky Mountains, two scientists armed with skis and clipboards peer at the long hollow tube they have just thrust vertically into a pristine snow drift.\n\n""Twenty-four inches, that\'s not so bad,"" says Brian Domonkos, before grabbing the metal cylinder--now stuffed with snow--and hitching it to a portable scale dangling from his colleague\'s ski pole.\n\nOriginally carried out using an improvised set of milk scales, this same measuring technique has been performed on this exact spot every winter since 1966, to assess the amount of water held in Colorado\'s crucial snowpack.\n\nAnd while the remote, stunningly picturesque Mosquito Creek area feels like a different planet from Los Angeles, the data it yields remains vital for calculating how much water will reach the parched, sprawling cities of the American West each summer.\n\n""We\'re all one water system,"" explains Domonkos. ""Fifty to 80 percent of all the water we use in the West comes from mountain snow melt.""\n\nIn this particular year, the stakes are unusually high. After more than two decades of drought, exacerbated by human-caused global warming, the region\'s giant reservoirs have dwindled to record lows.\n\nWhile winter has finally brought biblical rains to coastal cities, much of that has already flowed into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSo it is this powder, piled between pine trees atop the 10,000 foot- (3,000 meter-) high Colorado plateau, that will determine how much water is available to faraway urbanites in the coming dry months.\n\n""The April snow survey measurement is really the pinnacle, the peak of the snowpack for most of Colorado,"" says Domonkos.\n\n""That peak snowpack is the amount of water that\'s actually going to run off.""\n\nAs well as taking manual measurements at dozens of similar sites, Colorado Snow Survey employees like Domonkos check and repair hi-tech, automated snow monitoring stations scattered across the Rockies.\n\nThe combined data they yield allows scientists to predict the year\'s snowpack, and the job is a huge responsibility, says his colleague Nagam Gill.\n\nTheir output is eagerly awaited by everyone from local ski and snowmobile resorts to the state\'s snowplow operators, foresters and hydroelectric power generators.\n\nBut perhaps more crucially, Colorado is obliged to share a set percentage of the water it receives each year with downstream states.\n\nCalculate the year\'s snowfall wrong and send too much water down the river, and ""you\'re never going to get that water back,"" said Domonkos.\n\nStill, both scientists agree, the job has its advantages.\n\nIt frequently takes the pair--via ski, snowshoe or snowmobile--to beautiful unspoiled peaks and valleys of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Wyoming.\n\nDozens of other scientists perform the same duties as far away as Alaska, traveling to the most remote spots on horseback or by helicopter.\n\n""It\'s pretty much a dream job,"" said Domonkos, who occasionally paused the interview to quench his thirst with a scooped handful of pure white snow.\n\nHe said he frequently encounters moose and elk, and used to run into grizzly bears--""a respectable amount""--when he worked in Montana.\n\nDuring AFP\'s visit to Mosquito Creek, just east of the Continental Divide and 100 miles (160 kilometers) upstream from Denver, the snowpack is roughly similar to recent years.\n\nBut that is not the story for most of the region.\n\nIn the Colorado River Basin itself, which starts on the other side of this mountain and runs all the way to California, the snow is ""a good bit better,"" says Domonkos.\n\nIndeed, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is ""seeing some really huge numbers"" for snowmelt ""forecasted to flow into reservoirs throughout the Upper Colorado River Basin"" this summer, according to the organization\'s Paul Miller.\n\nThe federal science group\'s complex computer models now include data from satellite imagery and aircraft, but still rely really heavily on the long-running snow surveys, he told AFP.\n\nTheir conclusion? ""It\'s going to be a very wet year,"" said Miller.\n\nIndeed, 11 million acre-feet of water is expected to reach Lake Powell, the basin\'s first major reservoir--almost double the annual average of 6.3 million.\n\nAn acre-foot refers to an acre covered in water a foot deep, which equals about half an Olympic-size swimming pool.\n\nLake Powell and Lake Mead--another giant reservoir, near Las Vegas--currently sit around a quarter-full, but ""these numbers will probably get us up into the 30, 35 percent range,"" said Miller.\n\nOn current forecasts, this year will be the basin\'s ninth-wettest ever. If low temperatures and snowfall persist, it could break the top five.\n\nBut up on the mountain Domonkos, wrapped up warm in a blue ski jacket, sunglasses and a beanie hat, is remaining cautious.\n\n""Even though we have a largely above-normal snowpack in the Colorado (basin), it doesn\'t mean we\'re going to have great runoff at this point,"" Domonkos says.\n\nThe drought has stretched on for so long, he warns, ""it\'s going to take a number of years to overcome. https://phys.org/news/2023-04-colorado-survey-scoops-evidence-year.html"
"Column: OPEC&#43; surprise squeezed oil shorts LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Investors bought petroleum futures and options at the fastest rate for more than three years after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC  producer group members announced voluntary cuts in oil output.\n\nHedge funds and other money managers bought the equivalent of 128 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts over the seven days to April 4.\n\nThe buying came as OPEC  announced cuts totalling more than 1 million barrels per day on April 2 and after fund managers had already purchased 61 million barrels the previous week.\n\nPurchases centred on crude, in both Brent ( 73 million barrels) and NYMEX and ICE WTI ( 60 million barrels), with small sales of European gas oil (-2 million) and U.S. diesel (-3 million) and no change in U.S. gasoline.\n\nCRUDE SQUEEZE\n\nWith its surprise announcement, OPEC  successfully squeezed the shorts in crude petroleum, with bearish positions reduced to the lowest for 11 weeks since late January.\n\nSince March 21, funds have purchased a total of 174 million barrels of crude, the fastest rate since December 2019 and before that September 2017.\n\nBearish short positions were cut by 113 million barrels while fund managers added 61 million barrels of new bullish long positions.\n\nThe net long position was boosted to 400 million barrels (28th percentile for all weeks since 2013) from 226 million (1st percentile) on March 21.\n\nAnd the ratio of bullish long positions to bearish short ones surged to 5.39:1 (64th percentile) from 2.11:1 (8th percentile) two weeks earlier.\n\nAs a result, production cuts have returned hedge fund positions to where they were in late January, before turmoil in the banking sector in March sparked a wave of selling.\n\nChartbook: Oil and gas positions\n\nHedge funds reduced their position in Henry Hub futures and options in the seven days ending on April 4 for the first time in six weeks.\n\nPositions were trimmed by 55 billion cubic feet after being raised by 1,151 billion cubic feet over the previous five weeks.\n\nFund managers have generally become less bearish about gas prices as Freeport LNG's terminal has resumed exporting.\n\nFreeport's resumption should stabilise then gradually erase some of the surplus inventories accumulated since the third quarter of 2022.\n\nPortfolio managers still have a small overall short position of -105 billion cubic feet (28th percentile for all weeks since 2010) but it has been sharply reduced from -1,061 billion cubic feet (7th percentile) at the end of January.\n\n- Surprise, squeezing the shorts, and revealed preferences (April 3, 2023)\n\n- Oil prices rebound on hedge fund short covering (April 3, 2023)\n\n- Fearing credit crunch, hedge funds flee petroleum (March 27, 2023)\n\n- U.S. gas prices slump after mild winter leaves big surplus (March 24, 2023)\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

"Search for alien life extends to Jupiter's icy moons Could vast, long-hidden oceans be teeming with alien life in our very own Solar System?\n\nA new chapter in humanity\'s search for extraterrestrial life opens on Thursday as Europe\'s JUICE spacecraft blasts off on a mission to investigate the icy moons of Jupiter.\n\nFirst discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei more than 400 years ago, these ice-covered moons are so far from the Sun that they were long dismissed as possible candidates to host life in our backyard.\n\nUntil recently, the Solar System\'s habitable zone was thought to ""end at Mars"", French astrophysicist Athena Coustenis, one of the scientific leads of the European Space Agency (ESA)\'s JUICE mission, told AFP.\n\nBut NASA\'s Galileo probe to Jupiter in 1995 and the more recent Cassini spacecraft\'s trip to Saturn caused scientists to broaden their horizons.\n\nThe gas giant planets themselves were correctly ruled out, but their icy moons--particularly Jupiter\'s Europa and Ganymede, and Saturn\'s Enceladus and Titan--offered fresh hope of nearby life.\n\nUnder their icy surfaces are thought to be huge oceans of liquid water--a crucial ingredient for life as we know it.\n\nNicolas Altobelli, a JUICE project scientist at ESA, said it would be ""the first time that we explore habitats beyond the frost line"" between Mars and Jupiter.\n\nBeyond that line, temperatures plummet and ""liquid water can no longer exist on the surface"", Altobelli told AFP earlier this year.\n\nThe Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission launches from Europe\'s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana on Thursday on an eight-year odyssey through space.\n\nBy July 2031 it will have entered Jupiter\'s orbit, from which it will probe Ganymede, Europa and fellow icy moon Callisto.\n\nThen, in 2034, JUICE will enter the orbit of Ganymede, the first time a spacecraft has done so around a moon other than our own.\n\nAs well as being the largest moon in the Solar System, Ganymede is also the only one that has its own magnetic field, which protects it from dangerous radiation.\n\nThis is just one of several signs that Ganymede\'s hidden ocean could provide a stable environment for life.\n\nUnlike similar missions to Mars, which focus on finding signs of ancient life long since extinguished, scientists hope Jupiter\'s icy moons will still be home to living organisms, even if only tiny or single-celled.\n\nSuch habitability requires a power source. Lacking energy from the Sun, the moons could instead take advantage of the gravity that Jupiter exerts on its satellites.\n\nThe force creates a process called tidal heating, which warms the interior of the moons and keeps their water liquid.\n\nGanymede\'s ""gigantic"" liquid ocean is trapped between two thick layers of ice dozens of kilometers beneath the surface, said Carole Larigauderie, JUICE project head at French space agency CNES.\n\n""On Earth, we still find life forms at the bottom of the abyss,"" she added.\n\nTiny microbes such as bacteria and archaea have been found to be able to survive on Earth without sunlight, raising hopes that life elsewhere will be able to do the same.\n\nAs well as water and energy, life needs nutrients.\n\n""The big question is therefore whether Ganymede\'s ocean contains"" the necessary chemical elements, Coustenis said.\n\nThe ocean would need to be able to absorb the nutrients from anything that fell on the moon\'s surface, for example, which would eventually dissolve into the water, she added.\n\nJUICE\'s array of instruments will probe Ganymede\'s ocean to determine its depth, distance from the surface and--hopefully--its composition.\n\nThe ESA\'s 1.6 billion euro ($1.7 billion) probe will spend eight months orbiting Ganymede, getting as close as 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the moon, all while sheltered from radiation.\n\nIt will not be the only spacecraft lurking around Jupiter.\n\nNASA\'s Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October next year. It will take a quicker path to Jupiter, arriving at Europa in 2030.\n\nIf one--or more--of Jupiter\'s moons ticks all the boxes to host life, the ""logical next step"" would be to send a mission to land on the surface, said Cyril Cavel, JUICE project manager at manufacturer Airbus.\n\nAlthough there are no plans for such a mission, which could definitively prove the existence of life outside of Earth, ""that\'s part of the dream,"" he said. https://phys.org/news/2023-04-alien-life-jupiter-icy-moons.html"
"Leaked Pentagon documents appeared on a 'Minecraft' Discord server weeks before officials knew about a breach: report A ""Minecraft"" Discord server could be a critical link in the mystery of how a large cache of US intelligence documents was leaked online in recent weeks.\n\nAt least 10 such documents were posted in March on a Discord server dedicated to the ""Minecraft "" video game, Bellingcat investigator Aric Toler reported.\n\nDiscord, a gaming messaging platform, allows users to send text, audio, video, and photos to chatrooms.\n\nThe documents on Discord were sent on March 4, more than a month before the leaked data appeared on 4Chan and Telegram, where media outlets and officials caught wind of the sensitive information.\n\nSince Thursday, Justice Department and Pentagon officials have been scrambling to determine the origin of the major leak, which they learned about when The New York Times published a story about the documents.\n\nAround 100 leaked files have been discovered so far. Exactly how many documents were leaked -- and how many are genuine or fabricated -- is still unclear.\n\nThe documents include US intelligence on the war in Ukraine and surveillance on allies such as South Korea and Israel. Some files also suggest that the UK may have deployed as many as 50 special forces personnel in Ukraine, per The Guardian.\n\nSome of the 10 documents on Discord were marked ""Top Secret"" and appeared to contain maps and casualty figures for Ukraine, Bellingcat reported. They were posted on the ""Minecraft Earth Map"" server by a user trying to win an argument, per the outlet.\n\n""Here, have some leaked documents,"" the user wrote.\n\n""Nice,"" replied another.\n\nOn the ""Minecraft Earth Map"" server, the documents gained wider attention and eventually made their way to 4Chan and Telegram, but the leak likely originated elsewhere, Bellingcat reported.\n\nThe user who posted the documents claimed they obtained them from another Discord server created by a YouTuber called Wow_Mao, per Bellingcat.\n\nWow_Mao told The New York Times he does not spend much time managing his Discord server but admits he could have moderated it better. He told The Times that he found it ""hilarious"" that the compromised information appeared on his server.\n\nBut it\'s also possible that the leak could have originated in another Discord server, which has now been deleted, Bellingcat reported.\n\nIn January, a document of a similar style was posted on a server called ""Thug Shaker Central,"" though its name often changed, Toler reported.\n\nThe analyst cited conversations with several members of the Discord server, who sent him images of the documents.\n\n""Yet given the images shared were screengrabs and not a link to the original server post, which has been taken down, it is not possible to independently verify their authenticity,"" Toler wrote.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time sensitive documents have leaked in gaming communities. Players of ""War Thunder,"" a video game that involves piloting combat vehicles, in 2021 shared classified information about British, French, and Chinese tanks on an online forum.\n\nMeanwhile, some US allies say many of the leaked documents may be fake. South Korea\'s presidential office said on Monday that both Washington and Seoul believe a ""considerable amount of the documents were fabricated.""\n\nUkraine officials also cast doubt on the veracity of the leaked information.\n\n""The aim of secret data \'leaks\' is obvious: divert attention, cast doubts & mutual suspicions, sow discord,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted on Sunday.\n\nDiscord and the US Department of Defense did not immediately respond to Insider\'s requests for comment sent outside regular business hours. https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-document-leaks-origins-appeared-minecraft-discord-server-report-2023-4"
"NASA unveils 'Mars' habitat for year-long experiments on Earth Four small rooms, a gym and a lot of red sand--NASA unveiled on Tuesday its new Mars-simulation habitat, in which volunteers will live for a year at a time to test what life will be like on future missions to Earth\'s neighbor.\n\nThe facility, created for three planned experiments called the Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA), is located at the US space agency\'s massive research base in Houston, Texas.\n\nFour volunteers will begin the first trial this summer, during which NASA plans to monitor their physical and mental health to better understand humans\' fortitude for such a long isolation.\n\nWith that data, NASA will better understand astronauts\' ""resource use"" on Mars, said Grace Douglas, lead researcher on the CHAPEA experiments.\n\n""We can really start to understand how we\'re supporting them with what we\'re providing them, and that\'s going to be really important information to making those critical resource decisions,"" she said on a press tour of the habitat.\n\nSuch a distant mission comes with ""very strict mass limitations,"" she added.\n\nThe volunteers will live inside a 1,700 square-foot (160 square-meter) home, dubbed ""Mars Dune Alpha,"" which includes two bathrooms, a vertical farm to grow salad, a room dedicated to medical care, an area for relaxing and several workstations.\n\nAn airlock leads to an ""outdoor"" reconstruction of the Martian environment--though still located inside the hangar.\n\nSeveral pieces of equipment astronauts would likely use are scattered around the red sand-covered floor, including a weather station, a brick-making machine and a small greenhouse.\n\nThere is also a treadmill on which the make-believe astronauts will walk suspended from straps to simulate the red planet\'s lesser gravity.\n\n""We really can\'t have them just walking around in circles for six hours,"" joked Suzanne Bell, head of NASA\'s Behavioral Health and Performance Laboratory.\n\nFour volunteers will use the treadmill to simulate long trips outside to collect samples, gathering data or building infrastructure, she said.\n\nThe members of the first experiment team have yet to be named, but the agency stated that selection ""will follow standard NASA criteria for astronaut candidate applicants,"" with a heavy emphasis on backgrounds in science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nResearchers will regularly test the crew\'s response to stressful situations, such as restricting water availability or equipment failures.\n\nThe habitat has another special feature: it was 3D-printed.\n\n""That is one of the technologies that NASA is looking at as a potential to build habitat on other planetary or lunar surfaces,"" Douglas said.\n\nNASA is in the early stages of preparation for a mission to Mars, though most of the agency\'s focus is on upcoming Artemis missions, which aim to return humans to the Moon for the first time in half a century. https://phys.org/news/2023-04-nasa-unveils-mars-habitat-year-long.html"
"Albania pushes out boat to save world's rarest seal A team of Albanian marine biologists scan the azure waters of the Ionian Sea for a sign of one of the rarest marine mammals in the world.\n\nMediterranean monk seals were once abundant, but now there are only a few hundred left in small scattered groups off Albania, Greece and Turkey and in Mauritania, on Africa\'s Atlantic coast.\n\nYet there are glimmers of hope for their survival despite a dramatic decline caused by overfishing and the overdevelopment of their coastal habitat.\n\nNumbers are beginning to slowly rebound thanks to the creation of protected marine areas in recent years, experts say.\n\nThe seals have gone from being ""critically endangered"" in 2015 on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\'s red list to now being simply endangered.\n\nEven so, they are still extremely difficult to track. Having previously lounged around on beaches, the seals have now retreated to the safety of isolated sea caves.\n\nIn Albania, ""scientists have spotted a handful of the species thanks to meticulous work to identify the caves and coves where these shy animals hide, especially to give birth,"" biodiversity expert Nexhip Hysolakoj told AFP.\n\nThey have spent the past five years placing cameras in caves and other secluded spots along southern Albania\'s Adriatic and Ionian coasts to better track the animals.\n\nHysolakoj, who works in the Karaburun-Sazan marine reserve, regularly sets out from the port of Vlora aboard a vessel named the ""Foka"", or ""seal"" in Albanian, to check memory cards in the cameras hidden along the coastline.\n\nIt\'s ""a real challenge because in order to capture the right images, they must be positioned toward the inner beaches of these caves, where the seals come to rest,"" he said.\n\nThe latest monk seals discovered by the team were spotted in January when they captured images of what was probably a female and her pup. They photographed two others in 2020, and there has also been a smattering of other sightings by tourists--each greeted like a small victory.\n\nResearchers tracking the mammal mostly ply the marine national park created in 2010 along the shores of the Karaburun Peninsula and Sazan Island--a sanctuary where commercial fishing is prohibited, and from which large boats are banned.\n\nLocals say monk seals were once numerous on Albanian beaches even though they were rarely tracked or monitored by scientists, especially during the decades of hardline communist rule.\n\nBut even there their populations were mauled by hunting and overfishing--with dynamite often even used--while pollution, tourism and climate change have further eroded numbers.\n\nThe illegal hunting of the seals and the ""destruction of habitats or other factors have forced it to completely change its biological behaviour,"" said Aleksander Trajce, of the Protection and Preservation of Natural Environment in Albania advocacy group.\n\nSo cameras and regular field trips are some of the only ways of observing the species\' health.\n\n""Only regular monitoring allows us to identify the presence of the monk seal and to define the sites to be protected,"" French researchers Jordi Salmona and Philippe Gaubert from the University of Toulouse\'s Evolution and Biological Diversity Laboratory told AFP in an email exchange.\n\nThe waters off Albania have become increasingly emptied of fish over the years, fishermen say, which puts them and the seals in the same boat.\n\n""Seals feed mainly on fish, squid and shellfish. Less fish means fewer opportunities for them,"" said Baci Dyrmishaj, a fisherman in Vlora.\n\nSo in a land where superstitions are legion, fishermen have invented a new one to try to protect the monk seals.\n\n""The seals bring luck to those who see them,"" said Dyrmishaj.

"Volcano eruption in Russia's Kamchatka spews vast ash clouds A volcano erupted early Tuesday on Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, spewing clouds of dust 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the sky and covering broad areas with ash.\n\nThe ash cloud from the eruption of Shiveluch, one of Kamchatka's most active volcanoes, extended over 500 kilometers (more than 300 miles) northwest and engulfed several villages in grey volcanic dust.\n\nOfficials closed the skies over the area to aircraft. Local authorities advised residents to stay indoors and shut schools in several affected communities. Two villages had their power supplies cut for a few hours until emergency crews restored them.\n\nAsh fell on 108,000 square kilometers (41,700 square miles) of territory, according to the regional branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences Geophysical Survey. Scientists described the fallout as the biggest in nearly 60 years.\n\nThe village of Klyuchi, which is about 50 kilometers (some 30 miles) from the volcano, was covered by an 8-centimeter (3-inch) layer of dust. Residents posted videos showing the ash cloud plunging the area into darkness.\n\nKamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said there was no need for mass evacuation, but added that some residents who have health issues could be temporarily evacuated.\n\nShiveluch has two parts, the 3,283-meter (10,771-foot) Old Shiveluch, and the smaller, highly active Young Shiveluch.\n\nThe Kamchatka Peninsula, which extends into the Pacific Ocean about 6,600 kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow, is one of the world's most concentrated area of geothermal activity, with about 30 active volcanoes.\n\n  2023 The Associated Press.

"These 4 European Cities Are Introducing Tourist Taxes In 2023 The entry fee imposed on visitors often goes towards infrastructure and public services or that ... [ ] benefit residents.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Europe this year, you might need to budget for a few extra costs.\n\nSeveral cities have introduced tourist taxes, many in a bid to combat overtourism.\n\nThe entry fee imposed on visitors often goes towards infrastructure and public services that benefit residents.\n\nSo even though your vacation may be a little pricier, remember your money is going towards a good cause.\n\nHere are four European cities you'll have to pay to visit in 2023.\n\nManchester in northern England has become the first city in the UK to require payment from tourists.\n\nStarting April 1, travelers staying in hotels or rental accommodation in the city center must pay a fee of £1 ($1.24) per night per room.\n\nLocal authorities say the scheme aims to raise funds to boost visitor services and improve street cleanliness.\n\nManchester is rich with industrial heritage, which visitors can explore at the interactive Museum of Science & Industry and by wandering the 18th-century network of canals.\n\nVisitors to Valencia now have to pay to stay in the southeastern coastal Spanish city.\n\nThe tourist tax applies to travelers staying in all types of accommodation including hotels, apartments, hostels and campsites.\n\nThe fee varies from 50 cents to €2 per night ($0.55 to $2.18) depending on the accommodation.\n\nProceeds from the scheme will go towards generating more affordable housing for residents living in highly-touristed areas.\n\nBarcelona attracts millions of visitors a year, who already pay a tourist tax.

Stocks had touched a four-week high of 11.602 million barrels in the week ended March 27.\n\nA slight built in stocks was likely due to a dip in demand going into the long Easter holiday weekend, traders said. Even so, the downstream marine fuels market has on the whole seen an uptick in demand since early last week, a trend that has improved this week, UAE-based bunker traders said.\n\nTraders have attributed a rise in demand to buyers, especially those that have otherwise been on the sidelines, rushing in to meet their requirements after flat price rallied due to OPEC  decision to further cut oil output.\n\nA rise in demand in recent days has, in turn, led to tight availability for some of the suppliers, especially for product deliverable prior to April 18, traders said.\n\nTraders have also attributed tight availability, especially on an ex-wharf basis, of low sulfur bunker fuel, to an unplanned maintenance shutdown at Kuwait's Al Zour refinery.\n\nThe premium for Fujairah-delivered marine fuel 0.5%S bunker over benchmark Singapore marine fuel 0.5% cargo rose $4.02/mt day on day at $15.35/mt on April 11, S&P Global data showed.\n\nStocks of middle distillates, including diesel and jet fuel, plunged 18.9% to 2.494 million barrels, to the lowest level since March 6.\n\nThe Asian gasoil market was expected to be mixed over April 10-14 as traders weigh demand and supply balances.\n\nSome market sources said possibly higher volumes flowing into Asia from India and the Persian Gulf could weigh on the gasoil complex, while some others said the barrels could help fill a supply gap due to leaner volumes expected in April from major northeast Asian exporters.\n\nThe fall in middle distillates inventories was despite easing gasoil and jet fuel market structures. Backwardation flattening typically incentivizes storage of barrels over sales as later-loading cargoes command a higher cash differential than earlier-loading ones.\n\nTotal stocks at Fujairah are down 4% since the start of the year, with heavy residues up 0.9%, with middle distillates down 19.3% and light distillates down 4%. https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/041223-fujairah-data-oil-product-inventory-rises-as-light-distillates-stocks-soar-18"

"Salting and burying biomass crops in dry landfills could economically capture greenhouse gases for thousands of years Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is critical to avoiding a climate disaster, but current carbon removal methods are proving to be inadequate and costly. Now researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, have proposed a scalable solution that uses simple, inexpensive technologies to remove carbon from our atmosphere and safely store it for thousands of years.\n\nAs reported today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers propose growing biomass crops to capture carbon from the air, then burying the harvested vegetation in engineered dry biolandfills. This unique approach, which researchers call agro-sequestration, keeps the buried biomass dry with the aid of salt to suppress microbials and stave off decomposition, enabling stable sequestration of all the biomass carbon.\n\nThe result is carbon-negative, making this approach a potential game changer, according to Eli Yablonovitch, lead author and Professor in the Graduate School in UC Berkeley\'s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.\n\n""We\'re claiming that proper engineering can solve 100% of the climate crisis, at manageable cost,"" said Yablonovitch. ""If implemented on a global scale, this carbon-negative sequestration method has the potential to remove current annual carbon dioxide emissions as well as prior years\' emissions from the atmosphere.""\n\nUnlike prior efforts toward carbon neutrality, agro-sequestration seeks not net carbon neutrality, but net carbon negativity. According to the paper, for every metric ton (ton) of dry biomass, it would be possible to sequester approximately 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe idea of burying biomass in order to sequester carbon has been gaining popularity, with startup organizations burying everything from plants to wood. But ensuring the stability of the buried biomass is a challenge. While these storage environments are devoid of oxygen, anaerobic microorganisms can still survive and cause the biomass to decompose into carbon dioxide and methane, rendering these sequestration approaches carbon-neutral, at best.\n\nBut there is one thing that all life forms require--moisture, rather than oxygen. This is measured by ""water activity,"" a quantity similar to relative humidity. If internal water activity falls below 60%, all life comes to a halt--a concept underpinning the UC Berkeley researchers\' new agro-sequestration solution.\n\n""There are significant questions concerning long-term sequestration for many of these recently popularized nature- and agriculturally-based technologies,"" said Harry Deckman, co-author of the study and a researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. ""The agro-sequestration approach we\'re proposing can stably sequester the carbon in dried salted biomass for thousands of years, with less cost and higher carbon efficiency than these other air capture technologies.""\n\nHugh Helferty, co-founder and president of Producer Accountability for Carbon Emissions (PACE), a nonprofit committed to attaining global net zero emissions by 2050, sees great promise in this solution. ""Agro-sequestration has the potential to transform temporary nature-based solutions into permanent CO2 storage,"" said Helferty, who is not involved with the study. ""By developing their approach, Deckman and Yablonovitch have created an invaluable new option for tackling climate change.""\n\nLiving cells must be able to transfer water-solubilized nutrients and water-solubilized waste across their cell walls to survive. According to Deckman, decreasing the water activity below 60% has been shown to stop these metabolic processes.\n\nTo achieve the necessary level of dryness, Yablonovitch and Deckman took inspiration from a long-term food preservation technique dating back to Babylonian times: salt.\n\n""Dryness, sometimes assisted by salt, effectively reduces the internal relative humidity of the sequestered biomass,"" said Yablonovitch. ""And that has been proven to prevent decomposition for thousands of years.""\n\nResearchers point to a date palm named Methuselah as proof that biomass, if kept sufficiently dry, can be preserved well beyond the next millennium.\n\nIn the 1960s, Israeli archaeologist Yigal Yadin discovered date palm seeds among ancient ruins atop Masada, a mesa overlooking the Dead Sea--one of the most arid places in the world. The seeds remained in a drawer for more than 40 years, until Sarah Sallon, a doctor researching natural medicines, requested them in 2005. After having the seeds carbon-dated, she learned that they were 2,000 years old and then asked horticulturist Elaine Solowey to plant them. They germinated, and Methuselah, one of those date palms, continues to thrive today.\n\n""This is proof that if you keep biomass dry, it will last for hundreds to thousands of years,"" said Yablonovitch. ""In other words, it is a natural experiment that proves you can preserve biomass for 2,000 years.""\n\nIn addition to offering long-term stability, Yablonovitch and Deckman\'s agro-sequestration approach is extremely cost effective. Together, the agriculture and biolandfill costs total US$60 per ton of captured and sequestered carbon dioxide. (By comparison, some direct air capture and carbon dioxide gas sequestration strategies cost US$600 per ton.)\n\n""Sixty dollars per ton of captured and sequestered carbon dioxide corresponds to an added cost of $0.53 per gallon of gasoline,"" said Yablonovitch. ""At this price, offsetting the world\'s carbon dioxide emissions would set back the world economy by 2.4%.""\n\nThe researchers have compiled a list of more than 50 high-productivity plants capable of being grown in diverse climates worldwide and with dry biomass yields in a range from 4 to more than 45 dry tons per hectare. All have been selected for their carbon-capturing abilities.\n\nThis solution also can scale without encroaching upon or competing with farmland used to grow food. Many of these biomass crops can be grown on marginal pasture and forest lands, or even on farmland that has remained fallow.\n\n""To remove all the carbon that\'s produced would require a lot of farmland, but it\'s an amount of farmland that is actually available,"" said Yablonovitch. ""This would be a great boon to farmers, as there is farmland that is currently underutilized.""\n\nFarmers harvesting these biomass crops would dry the plants, then entomb them in a dry engineered biolandfill located within the agricultural regions, tens of meters underground and safe from human activity and natural disasters.\n\nThe researchers based their design of these dry tomb structures on current municipal landfill best practices, but added enhancements to ensure dryness, such as two 2-millimeter-thick nested layers of polyethylene encasing the biomass, a practice already used in modern landfills.\n\nThe landfill area would cover only a tiny portion--0.0001%--of the agricultural area. In other words, 10,000 hectares of biomass production could be buried in a 1-hectare biolandfill. In addition, the top surface of the landfill could be restored to agricultural production afterward.\n\nThe timeline for adoption of this carbon capture and sequestration method could be short, according to Deckman. ""Agro-sequestration is technologically ready, and construction of the engineered biolandfills could begin after one growing season,"" he said.\n\nYablonovitch and Deckman\'s analysis shows that farmers could make the transition to biomass agriculture rather quickly. They estimate that it would take about one year to convert existing farmland to biomass agriculture, but longer for virgin land that lacks the infrastructure needed to support agriculture. The biomass crops would be ready for harvest and sequestration within a growing season.\n\nUsing this approach, the researchers calculated that sequestering approximately half of the world\'s greenhouse gas emissions--about 20 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year--would require agricultural production from an area equal to one-fifth of the world\'s row cropland or one-fifteenth of the land area for all croplands, pastures and forests. According to their report, this amount of land is the same or less than the total area that many of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s models for greenhouse reduction are considering for biomass production.\n\n""Our approach to agro-sequestration offers many benefits in terms of cost, scalability and long-term stability,"" said Yablonovitch. ""In addition, it uses existing technologies with known costs to provide a practical path toward removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and solving the climate change problem. Nonetheless, society must continue its efforts toward de-carbonization; developing and installing solar and wind technologies; and revolutionizing energy storage.""\n\nMore information: Eli Yablonovitch et al, Scalable, economical, and stable sequestration of agricultural fixed carbon, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

"EIA Expects An Oil Market Surplus Despite OPEC  Cuts Despite OPEC \'s surprise production cut, the global oil market will remain in surplus this year and next as demand growth could be hurt by lower-than-expected economic growth in the coming months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).\n\nThe latest forecasts include declining production in OPEC and Russia, yet the EIA still expect global oil production to increase by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023, due to strong growth from non-OPEC countries excluding Russia. Non-OPEC  production growth will largely be driven by North and South America, the administration said.\n\nThis year, global oil production is set to average 101.3 million bpd, while global oil consumption is estimated at 100.87 million bpd. The surplus on the market will start to shrink this quarter, but even in Q3 the market will be in a slight surplus, the EIA forecasts.\n\nThat\'s contrary to some other projections that say the OPEC  cuts will tighten the market so much later this year that prices could jump to $100 per barrel.\n\nIf the current OPEC  cuts expire at the end of 2023, global oil production is set to average 103.25 million bpd in 2024, while consumption is expected at 102.72 million bpd--with supply outstripping demand next year, too, according to the EIA.\n\n""Increasing risks in the U.S. and global banking sectors increases uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions and their potential effects on liquid fuels consumption, which increases the possibility of liquid fuels consumption being lower than our current forecast,"" the EIA said.\n\n""We expect global oil markets will be in relative balance over the coming year.""\n\nGlobal oil inventories, which increased by 400,000 bpd in 2022 and by 1.1 million bpd in the first quarter of 2023, will be mostly unchanged during the second half of 2023, the EIA predicts. Inventory builds will average about 500,000 bpd beginning in 2024 if the OPEC  cuts expire at the beginning of next year.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/EIA-Expects-An-Oil-Market-Surplus-Despite-OPEC-Cuts.html"

"IberBlue Wind to Invest $4.36 bln in Portugal-Spain Floating Wind Farms Irish-Spanish consortium IberBlue Wind plans to invest more than 4 billion euros ($4.36 billion) in two [floating] wind farms off the Atlantic coasts of Portugal and Spain, it said on Tuesday.\n\nIberBlue said in a statement it aimed to create a combined installed capacity of 1.96 gigawatts (GW), enough to supply electricity to over one million homes, at two parks called Creoula, off Viana do Castelo in north Portugal, and Juan Sebastian Elcano, near Pontevedra in Spain.\n\nThe parks will have approximately 109 turbines altogether and will occupy an area of 530 square km (205 square miles), with the larger Creoula park having 80 turbines of 18 MW each.\n\nIt said Creoula will be located ""within the areas proposed by the Portuguese government for offshore wind farm development and will contribute to the target set to install 10 GW of offshore wind by 2030"".\n\nPortugal in January launched public consultations regarding proposals for demarcating offshore areas where wind farms can be built, estimating total investment of between 30 billion and 40 billion euros through 2030.\n\nEuropean nations are betting on renewable energy sources after gas prices hit record highs in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which was Europe\'s top gas supplier.\n\nPortugal aims to generate 80% of its annual electricity needs from renewable sources by 2026, up from around 60% in 2022, which was already one of the highest ratios in Europe.\n\nThe consortium estimates that the cost of cross-border development could be 32% lower than if the farms were to be developed separately.\n\nPartners in the consortium are Irish offshore floating wind energy developer Simply Blue Group, the engineering division of Spanish Grupo Amper, and Spanish renewables developer FF New Energy Ventures.\n\n(Reuters - Reporting by Sergio Goncalves; Editing by Andrei Khalip and Jan Harvey) https://www.oedigital.com/news/504297-iberblue-wind-to-invest-4-36-bln-in-portugal-spain-floating-wind-farms"
"Natural Gas Prices to Climb Above $3 in Q3 Amid 'Relatively Flat' Production Growth, EIA Says - Natural Gas Intelligence Natural gas spot prices at Henry Hub will average $2.65/MMBtu in the second quarter before climbing above the $3 mark in 3Q2023 amid increased consumption and flat domestic production, according to updated projections from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nHenry Hub prices also averaged $2.65 in the first quarter as ""spring-like"" temperatures tamped down demand in early 2023, the agency noted in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), published Tuesday.\n\nHowever, prices are poised to rise later this year as summer cooling demand kicks in and as production volumes remain ""relatively flat,"" according to the latest STEO.\n\n""We expect relatively flat U.S. natural gas production, rising demand for feed gas from Freeport LNG as the export terminal returns to full operations, and increased natural gas consumption in the electric power sector to raise natural gas prices through the summer,"" researchers said. ""We forecast the Henry Hub price to average slightly more than $3.00/MMBtu in 3Q2023.""\n\nU.S. dry natural gas production averaged 101.6 Bcf/d during the first quarter of 2023, a 1.4% increase over 4Q2022 output, with mild winter weather limiting disruptions from freeze-offs, EIA said.\n\nThe latest STEO modeled average domestic production of 100.9 Bcf/d for full-year 2023, a 3% increase over 2022 output.\n\n""If production were to increase by more than our forecast, it could put downward pressure on natural gas prices,"" researchers said.

"AMLO Says Mexico's CFE Will Command 65% of Generation Mix by Next Year - Natural Gas Intelligence Mexico\'s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wasn\'t able to change the constitution to favor state firms Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) and Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), but he remains determined to leave his mark on the energy sector before he leaves office in 2024.\n\nIn his daily press conference on Tuesday morning, López Obrador, or AMLO, said that by the end of next year 65% of the nation\'s power would be generated by CFE. The move would mark a win for the AMLO administration after years of efforts to get that figure up to 54%.\n\nThe president said the recent CFE purchase of 13 generation plants – 12 of which are combined cycle powered by natural gas – from Spanish firm Iberdrola would close in 45 days. After this, the Mexican utility would now control about 55% of the country\'s generation capacity, from about 39% today.\n\nThose that complain about the deal ""want to privatize profits and socialize losses,"" López Obrador said during his press conference Tuesday. He added that ""we couldn\'t do this if we didn\'t have solid public finances."" He said the $6 billion price tag for the 8.5 GW of already-operating capacity was 30% cheaper than building new projects.\n\nHe added that the transfer of the new plants to CFE\'s control would boost the firm\'s share of generation to 65%. He cited the combined-cycle plants in Mérida and Valladolid that would have capacities of 499 MW and 1,020 MW, respectively, and run primarily on gas imported from Texas. They are expected online at the end of 2024 or early 2025.\n\nThose projects include a slew of related natural gas infrastructure works to increase access to the fuel in the country\'s southeast. Projects include the completed 250 MMcf/d Cuxtal I interconnect, which links Mexico\'s Sistrangas network with Engie SA\'s Mayakan pipeline on the peninsula. Engie and CFE in November announced plans to double Cuxtal\'s capacity to 500 MMcf/d.\n\nThere is also the $4.5 billion Southeast Gateway offshore pipeline that CFE is jointly developing with TC Energy Corp. Southeast Gateway would function as an extension of the existing 2.6 Bcf/d Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline, bringing gas to the cities of Coatzacoalcos and Paraíso, Tabasco. Paraíso is the site of the Olmeca oil refinery, which Energy Minister Rocío Nahle has said could begin processing crude in July.\n\nEnergy analyst Rosanety Barrios told NGI\'s Mexico GPI that the Iberdrola purchase was political in nature. ""For the electric power system, there really is no great change."" She said antitrust regulator Cofece still had to approve the transaction.\n\nShe called it ""noteworthy"" that the Mexican Treasury said that the door would remain open for private sector investment ""under the tutelage of the state."" She said private investment had already been undermined in the country prior to the deal.\n\nLópez Obrador himself called the Iberdrola deal a ""nationalization."" He had previously publicly sparred with Iberdrola\'s management, calling the Spanish firm a continuation of imperialism in Mexico.\n\nLópez Obrador\'s hero is Lázaro Cárdenas, the president who nationalized Pemex in 1939. In campaigning for president, he used energy as a way of eliciting nationalistic sentiments.\n\nAccording to the latest poll by daily El Financiero, the president\'s popularity is on the rise again, and gained three percentage points to 57% in March.\n\nBut his term ends next year. His pick as successor would probably be Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum. The El Financiero poll had her leading the race for the presidency at 32%, followed by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at 21%. Sheinbaum has indicated a commitment to López Obrador\'s energy policies. https://www.naturalgasintel.com/amlo-says-mexicos-cfe-will-command-65-of-energy-mix-by-next-year/"
"Natural Gas Futures Eke Out Modest Gain Amid Rising LNG Demand, Strong Power Burns - Natural Gas Intelligence Natural gas futures prices bounced around Tuesday, with the prompt-month Nymex contract trading in a relatively tight range before ultimately settling modestly higher day/day. With LNG demand continuing to rise and weather forecasts rather uninspiring, the May Nymex contract edged up 1.4 cents to $2.186/MMBtu.\n\nCash prices shifted a dime or less at the vast majority of North American locations. NGI\'s Spot Gas National Avg. slipped 7.5 cents to $2.400.\n\nFeed gas deliveries to U.S. liquefied natural gas facilities are ramping up toward all-time highs, setting the stage for incremental gains later this year as Freeport LNG returns to full capacity and Calcasieu Pass comes fully online. NGI data showed feed gas volumes climbing to 14.61 Dth on Tuesday, up from 13.78 Dth a day earlier.\n\nThough the increasing LNG demand is occurring in the early days of the spring shoulder season – rather than the peak of winter – the uptrend is lending much-needed support to the market. After slipping below $2.00 in recent weeks, futures on Tuesday swung either side of $2.150.\n\nEBW Analytics Group noted that with strong LNG feed gas demand and decelerating production growth, fundamentals may soon strengthen. Coal-to-gas switching and the steady rise in cooling demand in the coming months may result in an early inflection point for natural gas prices as soon as next month.\n\nIn the immediate term, though, the May Nymex contract faces an enhanced risk of a relapse lower thanks in large part to mild weather. EBW said the near-term outlook this month\'s ""very meager"" heating demand could lead to the third largest monthly injection of natural gas into storage over the past decade. What\'s more, the robust injections would come amid historically low pricing.\n\nAlready, stocks are sitting more than 50% above both last year and five-year average levels, according to the latest government inventory report.\n\nWhat\'s more, the April increase in gas storage is projected to be 95 Bcf above the five-year average, according to EBW. While weather plays a predominant role, a post-winter bounce in natural gas production as Permian pipeline maintenance concludes also could weigh on storage balances.\n\nThat said, ""looser balances may be largely limited to the front half of April,"" EBW senior energy analyst Eli Rubin said. ""As weather normalizes in late April, elevated coal-to-gas switching, strong LNG and injection demand from local distribution companies could ratchet the physical supply/demand balance and help Nymex gas futures establish a sustainable bottom.""\n\nLooking a bit further out, Mobius Risk Group said the market is likely to keep a close watch on power generation demand this summer. Power burns soared to record levels last year – in the face of much higher prices – and provided a constant pull on natural gas in the Lower 48 alongside the growth in LNG demand abroad.\n\nRecent data points show an even greater share of available fossil load shifting to natural gas, according to Mobius. The result appears to be a lowering of end-of-season storage expectations.\n\n""Whether or not we test the 4 Tcf threshold or not this fall will most likely be determined by temperatures in the Southeastern quadrant of the country,"" Mobius\' Zane Curry, director of research. ""But for now, the market\'s attention is trained on the fact that power burn is recently running 2 Bcf/d year/year, or more, and we have yet to see any material cooling demand in the Southeast.""\n\nFully in the throes of spring, extended pipeline outages and the resulting disruptions of gas flows in some U.S. regions had little impact on spot gas prices given modest demand.\n\nIn West Texas, Waha and El Paso Permian moved back into positive territory despite the unexpected continuation of maintenance on Kinder Morgan Inc.\'s KM Tejas pipeline. The work was originally scheduled to conclude on Tuesday, but Kinder said it would go on until further notice.\n\nWaha next-gas day prices climbed 29.5 cents on the day to average 72.5 cents for Wednesday delivery. Prices similarly increased throughout most of West Texas.\n\nThe gains occurred even as the extended KM Tejas outage overlapped with the start of planned maintenance on Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (GCX). GCX planned to reduce its pipeline capacity to 1.2 Bcf/d on Tuesday and Wednesday and to 1.6 Bcf/d on Thursday and Friday.\n\n[Decision Maker: A real-time news service focused on the North American natural gas and LNG markets, NGI\'s All News Access is the industry\'s go-to resource for need-to-know information. Learn more.]\n\nEl Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) also began work Tuesday on its Line 1300. The work, set to continue until April 18, would shut in westbound flows through the Caprock N constraint, representing a cut of roughly 520 MMcf/d.\n\nWood Mackenzie said some of the gas not able to flow through KM Tejas was being rerouted to Tres Palacios Gas Storage. Since KM Tejas\' maintenance began, the Permian Highway Pipeline interconnects visible by Wood Mackenzie indicate that its deliveries have increased by around 200,000 MMBtu/d.\n\n""This uptick in deliveries is concentrated in Wharton County, TX, going to Tres Palacios,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Quinn Schulz.\n\nAs for pricing, South Texas cash wasn\'t reflecting the increased activity. Tres Palacios spot gas ticked up only 1.5 cents day/day to average $1.985.\n\nElsewhere across the Lower 48, Henry Hub cash edged up 3.5 cents to $2.190, setting the slow pace of movement for other U.S. locations.\n\nIn the Midwest, Consumers Energy slipped 2.5 cents to $2.110 and in the Midcontinent, Panhandle Eastern dropped 4.5 cents to $1.775.\n\nCash prices in the Northeast fell a bit more in some locations. Niagara plunged 20.0 cents to $1.650 for Wednesday\'s gas day. https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-futures-eke-out-modest-gain-amid-rising-lng-demand-strong-power-burns/"

"Birthmarks: Types, Causes, and Treatment Birthmarks are marks on or under the skin that are present at birth or that develop by 1 to 2 years old. There are several types of birthmarks, and they vary in shape, size, color, and texture.\n\nRead on to learn more about the types and characteristics of birthmarks.\n\nAnastasiia Yanishevska / EyeEm / Getty Images\n\nBirthmarks are areas of abnormally pigmented cells or blood vessels that cause discolored or raised patches of skin. They may be noticeable at birth or can appear within a few weeks to months to years. They are usually harmless but may be a sign of a more serious condition, particularly if they occur in large numbers or in clusters.\n\nMost birthmarks fall into two main categories, which are:\n\nVascular birthmarks can be raised or flat. They are typically red and may grow large. There are several types of vascular birthmarks.\n\nHemangiomas occur in up to 5% of newborns and are more common in girls and in babies who are premature. They can manifest in one of two ways.\n\nStrawberry hemangiomas:\n\nHemangiomas tend to grow quickly in the first year, then flatten out and start to fade. Often, they are completely faded by age 10. Sometimes, a slight discoloration or rippled texture may remain on the skin.\n\nSome hemangiomas require medical care as they can cause damage to other tissues if they develop on the lip, eyelid, or on organs, or other structures within the body.\n\nChildren with groups of hemangiomas that appear in a ""beard"" pattern around the mouth, chin, or one side of the face--or who have multiple small raised birthmarks that spread across the skin--are more likely to have internal hemangiomas.\n\nLarge hemangiomas on the face or middle of the back can indicate other problems, such as heart or spine abnormalities, and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.\n\nSalmon patches are also called:\n\nThey are small, flat, pink, or red marks caused by a cluster of blood vessels. They are the most common type of vascular birthmark, occurring in one-third to one-half of all babies.\n\nThe mark becomes more noticeable when the baby is overheated, irritated, having a bowel movement, or crying.\n\nSalmon patches can occur anywhere on the body, including the back of the neck, the forehead, the eyelids, or the lips. They are usually harmless and rarely require treatment. They usually fade within the first year, but those on the nape of the neck may last longer.\n\nUsually present at birth, port wine stains start out as flat pink or red areas, commonly on the face, and can thicken and darken to deeper red or purple. They can also grow in size.\n\nThough rare, port wine stains may indicate the neurological disorder Sturge-Weber syndrome, particularly when the birthmark covers half of the face or more. This medical condition causes an increased risk of glaucoma (results in increased pressure in the eye) and may cause seizures because of abnormal blood vessels in the lining that covers the brain.\n\nVenous Vascular Malformations\n\nVenous vascular malformations appear red or purple. They are caused by groups of unusually dilated or enlarged veins.\n\nThey grow slowly and can appear from birth through late childhood. They don\'t fade on their own but can be treated if necessary.\n\nThere are several types of pigmented birthmarks.\n\nCafé-au-lait spots are flat, brown, roughly oval-shaped marks that can be present at birth but often develop later (into early childhood). On light skin, they may appear the color of coffee with milk, while on dark skin, they may be the color of black coffee. They are caused by excess melanin production (natural pigment produced by skin cells).\n\nThese spots vary greatly, from the freckle size to covering a large skin area.\n\nThey are common, affecting up to 30% of children by age 6. They are usually harmless, but six or more spots may indicate a larger health problem, such as neurofibromatosis.\n\nDermal Melanocytosis\n\nThese birthmarks are flat, irregularly shaped blue-gray patches usually found on the back and buttocks. They often are apparent at birth.\n\nThey vary in size and may be mistaken for bruises. These spots are harmless and usually fade by ages 3 to 5 years.\n\nCongenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. They can vary in appearance and may:\n\nUnlike moles that develop later in life, congenital nevi are less commonly associated with skin cancer but should be checked regularly. See your child\'s healthcare provider if you notice changes. The risk of cancer development is greater if the mole is larger than 8 centimeters.\n\nMost congenital moles are harmless, but many small moles present at birth as excess pigmented cells growing in the central nervous system. Babies with this presentation should be seen by a dermatologist as this can cause pressure on the brain and seizures if not addressed.\n\nUsually found on the scalp, sebaceous nevi are tan or orange patches that are often hairless (or nearly hairless) and slightly raised. They are caused by an overgrowth of sebaceous glands (glands that secrete a waxy substance to moisturize skin and hair).\n\nThey are present at birth and may change over time, such as becoming thicker or changing color, but do not go away.\n\nThe risk is low, but sebaceous nevi may become cancerous and should be monitored by a dermatologist or healthcare professional.\n\nHypopigmented Macule\n\nHypopigmented macules are skin areas lighter in color than the surrounding skin. They can be raised or flat and vary in shape (commonly round, oval, or leaf-shaped). They can develop anywhere but are usually found on the chest, abdomen, back, or buttocks. Most go away on their own.\n\nStudies have shown anywhere from 10% to more than 40% of babies have birthmarks. Some are more common, such as café-au-lait spots, while others are less common, such as port wine stains.\n\nWhat causes a birthmark to develop is usually not known. Most of the time, they happen by chance. They are not caused by anything the pregnant parent did during pregnancy. They are not believed to be inherited.\n\nSome factors are more common in certain birthmarks.\n\nHemangiomas are more common in babies who are:\n\nDermal melanocytosis is more common in babies of Asian heritage and in those with darker skin.\n\nBirthmarks are usually harmless but may indicate an underlying problem or cause complications in rare cases.\n\nBirthmarks should be examined by a healthcare provider, particularly if they are:\n\nA healthcare provider may order tests, such as:\n\nYou should also monitor the birthmark for changes such as:\n\nMost birthmarks don\'t require treatment, but your healthcare provider may recommend treating or removing the birthmark if:\n\nTreatments depend on the characteristics of the birthmark. They may include:\n\nA birthmark is a mark on or under the skin that is present at birth or appears in early childhood. Birthmarks vary in appearance.\n\nMost birthmarks are harmless and do not need treatment, but they should be checked and monitored by a healthcare professional. Rarely, birthmarks can be a sign of a more serious condition or can lead to complications.\n\nTreatment for birthmarks may include laser therapy, surgery, cryotherapy, and/or medications.\n\nIf your child\'s birthmark is not causing medical problems and is not bothering them, you can usually just let them be. Many people love their birthmarks and consider the mark part of what makes them unique. https://www.verywellhealth.com/birthmark-6944592"
"Tapeworm Infection: Treatments, Symptoms, and More Tapeworms are a type of parasitic flatworm, and some species can infect humans. The worms live and grow in the digestive tract, a condition known as taeniasis.\n\nTapeworm infections are rare in the United States and tend to be more common parts of in the developing world due to contaminated and undercooked meat or fish. When an infection does occur, it is relatively easy to treat.\n\nThis article looks at the symptoms and causes of tapeworm infection and what is needed to diagnose, treat, and prevent taeniasis.\n\nIn most cases, infection with a tapeworm causes few or no symptoms. In fact, many people with taeniasis do not even realize that they\'ve been infected.\n\nIf there are signs and symptoms of taeniasis, they may include:\n\nAn untreated infection can also lead to vitamin B12 deficiency which, in turn, can cause anemia. This condition can occur when your body lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen to the tissues in your body.\n\nSigns and symptoms of anemia can include:\n\nWith certain types of tapeworm, such as those that infect pork, the larvae can move out of the digestive system and form fluid-filled cysts in other body parts (called cysticercosis). This may result in masses or lumps under the skin or in body tissues or organs.\n\nIf cysts develop in the central nervous system or the brain, there can be neurological symptoms referred to as neurocysticercosis. This can be quite serious.\n\nMany cases of taeniasis are asymptomatic (without symptoms). If you experience any of the signs or symptoms of tapeworm infection after traveling to an endemic area, seek medical attention.\n\nThis is especially true if you experience any of the rare signs and symptoms of cysticercosis, including:\n\nTapeworms don\'t usually cause complications. But if neurocysticercosis occurs, it can rapidly turn deadly if left untreated, leading to meningitis, hydrocephalus (""water on the brain""), seizures, and dementia. Even so, death from neurocysticercosis is rare, with only 211 deaths reported in the United States between 1985 and 2011.\n\nThere are different species of tapeworms that can infect humans, including:\n\nInfections are more common in the developing world in areas, where sanitation facilities are lacking and people may be in close contact with animals. Tapeworm infections in humans occur most often as a result of eating undercooked or raw beef, pork, or fish from an animal that was infected.\n\nAnother cause of infection is improper handwashing after coming in contact with tapeworms or tapeworm eggs.\n\nEating undercooked or raw meat, pork, or fish is the most common way that people are infected with a tapeworm. If the animal had tapeworms, the person eating the meat can also become infected.\n\nThe life cycle of a tapeworm begins with eggs. Tapeworm eggs can live outside of a host and in the environment (such as in water or on plants) for days or even months. Animals may become infected after eating plants or feed or drinking water that contains tapeworm eggs.\n\nOnce inside an animal host, the eggs hatch and mature into young tapeworms. The worms are mobile and can migrate out of the intestine and into muscle tissue.\n\nIf not frozen or cooked properly to kill the worms, the animal\'s meat contains living tapeworms. They then can be passed on to a human who eats the meat.\n\nA less common way of becoming infected with tapeworms is through contact with eggs from the pork tapeworm (T solium). The eggs are shed in the stool from an animal or a human who is infected.\n\nThe eggs can remain viable in the environment. This includes water, which is why it\'s important to ensure that the water you drink is germ-free.\n\nThe eggs can also be spread if an infected person doesn\'t wash their hands well after going to the bathroom and then handles food that is eaten by others.\n\nPork tapeworm eggs can also live on surfaces. It\'s possible to become infected through the use of objects such as dishes or silverware that have eggs on them.\n\nWhile infection with tapeworms does occur in the United States, it is more common in the developing world. Travel to areas where infections with tapeworms are common is a risk factor for people in the United States diagnosed with taeniasis or cysticercosis.\n\nCysticercosis mainly affects subsistence farming communities in developing countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nDiphyllobothrium infection is prevalent in northern Europe, Russia, Canada, Africa, Japan, Taiwan, Manchuria, Siberia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and South America.\n\nDiagnosis of infection in the digestive system includes testing the stool for tapeworms and/or looking at the anus area for eggs. Some people may notice tapeworms on or around their anus. A healthcare practitioner should see them during a physical exam.\n\nEd Reschke / Getty Images\n\nIn some cases, tapeworm segments may be visible in the stool. If this occurs, it is important to take a stool sample to a physician or a lab to get it tested.\n\nA stool test can determine which type of tapeworm is present. It might be necessary to collect and test stool from several different bowel movements over a few days to make the diagnosis.\n\nBlood tests for vitamin B12 levels and/or anemia may be done if there is an infection with the fish tapeworm. A blood test that looks for specific antibodies may be used to help diagnose cysticercosis.\n\nImaging tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be done if there are complications from an infection with pork tapeworm eggs that have migrated to other parts of the body.\n\nIn cases of intestinal tapeworm infection, treatment requires a medication that will immobilize the worms. Once the worms are unable to hang onto the lining of the intestine, they will be passed out of the body during a bowel movement.\n\nBiltricide (praziquantel) is an antiparasitic drug commonly used to treat tapeworm infections. For infection with the dwarf tapeworm (Hymenolepis nana), a medication called Alinia (nitazoxanide) may be appropriate.\n\nFor complications from infection with pork tapeworm eggs that have formed cysts, treatment will depend on the location of the cysts. It may be necessary to use medication or another treatment to manage the infection and associated complications in other areas of the body.\n\nThis video has been medically reviewed by Casey Gallagher, MD.\n\nSince the majority of tapeworm infections are the result of international travel, it is important to adhere to infection control practices when traveling to areas where tapeworms are endemic (widespread).\n\nThis includes parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America where there is subsistence farming (meaning where nearly all of the crops or livestock raised are used to maintain the farmer and the farmer\'s family).\n\nIn order to prevent tapeworm infection while traveling abroad:\n\nUnlike some infections, a tapeworm infection does not afford you immunity to repeated infections. Reinfection is common if strict infection control practices are maintained while in endemic regions).\n\nTapeworms are parasitic worms that can infect the digestive tract. Pork tapeworms can even move out of the gut and form cysts in other parts of the body, including the muscles and brain.\n\nThe most common way to get tapeworms is by eating infected beef, pork, or fish. It\'s also possible to get some types from contaminated water and surfaces.\n\nDiagnosis may involve an exam, stool tests, blood tests, and imaging. The infection is usually treated with medications that cause the worms to be passed out of the body.\n\nDeveloping a tapeworm infection may sound scary. And it can be. However, the chances of developing this infection are rather slim, even when traveling to areas where it occurs more commonly.\n\nInfections with most types of tapeworms are manageable with medication. It\'s important to get the infection treated and follow up with a healthcare provider to ensure that the treatment was effective.\n\nNot while it\'s in your system. However, you may be able to feel one as it passes through your anus during a regular bowel movement.\n\nYou aren\'t likely to see an entire tapeworm in your stool. Once it\'s been treated, it detaches from the intestines and dissolves before it leaves your body. Sometimes eggs or segments of a tapeworm, called proglottids, that pass out in bowel movements can be spotted, however.\n\nNo. If a tapeworm infection isn\'t treated, the parasite is likely to stay put. That said, depending on the type of tapeworm, you may never know it\'s there.\n\nPork, beef, and fish tapeworms can grow to between 15 feet and 30 feet long.The aptly named dwarf tapeworm can reach a maximum of 2 inches. https://www.verywellhealth.com/tapeworm-infection-overview-4163644"

"Will You Need Another COVID Booster This Spring? More than six months have passed since updated COVID-19 vaccines with Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 spike proteins rolled out. Many people are wondering whether it\'s nearly time to get another booster, or whether they\'ll need to start getting yearly COVID boosters as with annual flu shots.\n\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal, officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are said to be weighing whether to authorize a second dose of bivalent COVID boosters for high-risk people. But for the general population, another shot in the near future is unlikely.\n\nHere\'s what experts want you to know about spring COVID boosters.\n\nFor the time being, if you\'ve gotten a bivalent booster, you\'re considered to be up-to-date with your vaccines.\n\n""There is no additional need for a booster vaccine if one has already received the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine,"" Gonzalo Bearman, MD, chief of infectious diseases for Virginia Commonwealth University Health, told Verywell.\n\nAccording to David Dowdy, MD, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\'s department of epidemiology, the challenge with a broad recommendation for a second bivalent booster shot is the lack of data.\n\nWhile there is strong evidence that the current vaccine series is effective against serious COVID illness, Dowdy said that ""it\'s not entirely clear how helpful another dose of the Omicron-tailored shot would be for high-risk individuals.""\n\nHealth officials are monitoring new and changing data on COVID vaccination to help them make recommendations, which are only based on the current situation--they\'re not yet at a point where they want people to think about additional boosters as being part of a yearly routine like, say, flu shots are.\n\nAuthorizing another vaccine booster dose for high-risk people would be in line with World Health Organization\'s (WHO) revised roadmap for COVID-19 vaccination priority.\n\nThe WHO\'s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recently recommended an additional booster 6 or 12 months after the last dose for high-priority groups, which includes older adults, frontline healthcare workers, people with comorbid or immunocompromising health conditions, and pregnant people.\n\nRecommending another booster dose would not mean that the bivalent boosters are not capable of protecting against COVID-19. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries use the bivalent vaccines for primary vaccination, not just for boosters.\n\nThe bivalent booster is still effective against the circulating variants of COVID, but a person\'s immunity can wane over time. That\'s why a seasonal or annual booster vaccination might end up being necessary at some point in the future. In fact, the Biden Administration reportedly has plans to roll out another reformulated COVID booster later this year.\n\n""I do not see a compelling need to generate new formulations, especially with the burden of COVID-19 declining,"" Dowdy said. ""But that doesn\'t mean there won\'t be a role for those additional formulations in the future.""\n\nFor now, getting another bivalent booster dose is not authorized by the FDA. If it has been about six months since your last dose and you want to increase your protection from COVID, experts say you should focus on taking the usual precautions like wearing high-quality face masks, avoiding large indoor gatherings with poor ventilation, and washing your hands often and properly.\n\n""Make sure that you don\'t become a source of infection,"" Dowdy said. ""If you are having symptoms of COVID-19--or other respiratory illnesses--make sure that you are wearing a mask, and [stay] home when possible.""\n\nIf you\'ve already gotten a bivalent COVID booster, you might not need an additional booster this spring. An additional dose might be recommended for high-risk people if the FDA signs off.\n\nThe information in this article is current as of the date listed, which means newer information may be available when you read this.

"Prurigo Simplex: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment Prurigo simplex is a form of skin disease. The term prurigo is used to describe the presence of spots on the skin that are extremely itchy. The bumps associated with prurigo simplex are similar to bug bites. Other skin diseases also develop prurigo but are not the same as prurigo simplex.\n\nIn prurigo simplex, itchy bumps develop without any provocation. In addition, the spots and rash associated with chronic prurigo and other skin diseases develop after scratching, making them secondary conditions.\n\nThis article discusses the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for prurigo simplex.\n\nAsia Vision / Getty Images\n\nWhile prurigo simplex is typically considered idiopathic (occurring spontaneously or from an unknown cause), some underlying health disorders are commonly associated with the condition.\n\nConditions such as diabetes and kidney or liver dysfunction have commonly been found alongside prurigo simplex. Mental health disorders have also been linked to the condition, especially in women between 40 and 60.\n\nThere are certain environmental triggers associated with prurigo simplex, such as being exposed to either extremely hot or extremely cold temperatures. Other possible factors that may trigger prurigo simplex include:\n\nThe main symptom of prurigo simplex is spots that develop on the skin. These are typically small in size and shaped like domes. In some cases, small blisters form on the skin as well.\n\nWhen the spots or blisters develop, they are symmetrical, meaning they appear in equal amounts on both sides of the body. The areas of the body most affected include:\n\nThe head, neck, and torso can also be affected. The one main characterization of the spots is intense itch. People with the disorder may also experience dermographism, a skin condition that appears with swelling or red lines on the skin after only mild pressure or scratching is applied to the area.\n\nEven though the symptoms of prurigo simplex are typically isolated to one affected area, the intense itch leads to issues with sleeping. Over time, this can compromise a person's overall health.\n\nDiagnosing prurigo simplex may require several different tests as it can be caused by many factors. These tests are used to help rule out other causes of prurigo and if there are any other underlying health issues at play.\n\nA skin biopsy is used to check for other skin conditions such as dermatitis herpetiformis, a herpes-like skin disorder that develops in people with celiac disease.\n\nImmunofluorescence may be used in the diagnostic process of prurigo simplex. This test uses a dye to highlight immune system dysfunction often seen in various types of skin disorders.\n\nOther tests also used to rule out other conditions include:\n\nWhile prurigo simplex can be seen with the naked eye, it looks similar to several other disorders. That is why the diagnostic process involves many screening tests.\n\nThere is no cure for prurigo simplex, but once the condition is diagnosed, treatment can begin to manage symptoms. Unfortunately, some of the most common treatments for other skin diseases, such as antihistamines and topical steroids, do not always work well for people with prurigo simplex.\n\nSome effective treatment options include:\n\nIf you experience any type of intense itchiness and raised bumps on the skin, you should see your healthcare provider. While many of the conditions associated with these symptoms are non-life-threatening, getting the proper diagnosis quickly can help relieve the itching. The sooner you start treatment, the sooner you can manage symptoms of prurigo simplex.\n\nPrurigo simplex is a form of skin disease that typically develops on its own without the presence of an underlying skin disorder. A person with the condition experiences intense itchiness and raised bumps on the skin. These bumps are typically small and some can develop into blisters.\n\nWhile the cause isn't well known, some factors come into play regarding how it develops. These factors can include extreme hot or cold exposure and a person's overall stress level. Certain health conditions that affect the kidneys, liver, or the way the body processes food into energy can also play a role. Prurigo simplex has also been associated with mental health disorders.\n\nDiagnosing the condition early using various blood tests, scans, or a skin biopsy to rule out other skin disorders is important to start treatment. While treatment will not be able to completely cure prurigo simplex, there are several effective treatment options that relieve symptoms.\n\nDealing with the intense itchiness involved in prurigo simplex can be excruciating, especially if you are not sure what is causing it. Discuss any type of new intense itches or bumps with your healthcare provider. These disorders are often easy to cope with once treatment is in place. Getting diagnosed quickly can keep you from having to deal with the symptoms longer than you have to.\n\nWhile the rash-like area affected by the condition may be alarming, it is not contagious. If you do have the condition, you will not pass it on to others.\n\nJust like many other skin diseases that present with intense itchiness, there is no cure for prurigo simplex. That said, people with the disorder don't have to suffer the symptoms in silence. There are several treatment options that are highly effective at relieving symptoms.\n\nThe direct cause of prurigo simplex isn't clear but there are some existing factors related to the condition, including https://www.verywellhealth.com/prurigo-simplex-5324445"
"Why Don&#39;t You Feel Pain During Surgery? Doctors Are Getting Better at Measuring Pain Response Pain control is a major concern for patients who need to have surgery. Nobody wants to wake up from surgery in pain, but too much pain medicine may cause difficulties in recovery.\n\nThanks to anesthesia, most surgical patients are unconscious and therefore unaware of any pain their bodies are experiencing. However, the body still senses the stimuli that would cause pain and responds to it involuntarily. This response is called nociception.\n\n""Even when people are unconscious, pain signals still go to the brain,"" Daniel Sessler, MD, an anesthesiologist with the Cleveland Clinic, told Verywell. ""We know people respond to painful signals even if they\'re not conscious. Everyone is at risk of having pain during surgery. Even small operations cause plenty of pain.""\n\nYour body may react to painful sensations by increasing your heart rate or blood pressure or by sweating. You may also move involuntarily. Since you cannot tell your surgical team you are in pain, anesthesia providers closely monitor for these signs during surgery. Because these reactions may be subtle, it\'s possible for anesthesiologists to miss certain pain signals.\n\nA new device is helping anesthesiologists more precisely identify and respond to pain during surgery. Developers at Medasense, a biotech company in Ramat Gan, Israel, created a finger probe to continuously monitor four different pain signals during surgery.\n\nMedasense\'s device, the PMD-200, is a nociception monitor that uses a finger probe with sensors to measure the body\'s reaction to pain when a patient is under anesthesia.\n\nThe monitor analyzes a patient\'s heart rate, heart rate variability (how slowly or rapidly their heart rate changes), and body temperature to come up with a nociception level index (NOL) reading.\n\nThe NOL index is a scale of 0-to-100 (no pain to extreme pain). The target NOL score for a patient under anesthesia is around 25.\n\nIn theory, a patient with a higher NOL reading needs more pain medication during surgery while a patient with a lower NOL has enough pain relief. A patient on the lower end of the scale may need less pain medication than the anesthesia provider would typically give.\n\nAnesthesia providers typically use two classes of medications during surgery: anesthetics and analgesics. Anesthetics are medications that keep you unconscious during surgery. Analgesics, or painkillers, ease any pain your body may sense during and after the operation.\n\nWhile anesthesiologists already have a range of tools to keep an eye on a patient during surgery, no other technology that\'s currently used in the U.S. gives them the ability to monitor the body\'s response to pain as closely as the NOL index does.\n\nTo that end, the individualized information from the PMD-200 can help anesthesia providers carry out pain management for each patient. It\'s currently authorized for use during operations to help personalize analgesia dosing to the patient\'s actual requirement. It is not yet authorized to treat or monitor post-op pain.\n\nThe PMD-200 is already used in Europe, Canada, Australia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and select Latin American countries.\n\nIn the United States, the FDA recently granted de novo classification to the PM-200. The FDA reserves that classification for medical devices that are proven to be safe and effective and for which there are currently no comparable devices on the market.\n\nPain management during surgery is just the beginning. Not having enough pain medication during surgery can mean worse pain after surgery.\n\n""Patients under anesthesia still have physiological pain. The body will sense the pain and respond to it with the \'fight or flight\' response,"" Galit Zuckerman Stark, CEO and founder of Medasense, told Verywell. ""Once the patient becomes conscious again, they will feel the pain.""\n\nToo much pain medication during surgery, however, can make it more difficult for someone to come out of anesthesia. This can cause oversedation, delirium, or confusion.\n\nIt\'s not easy, but anesthesia providers need to find the sweet spot between too much and too little pain relief during surgery and maintain it.\n\n""Pain control during surgery is a balance between anesthesia and analgesia. You need to know which lever to pull,"" Padma Gulur, MD, an anesthesiologist with Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, told Verywell.\n\nBecause pain cases a stress response in the body, research suggests that reducing pain during surgery with the help of devices like the PMD-200 can improve recovery outcomes.\n\n""By adjusting opioids to the NOL index during surgery, you give that patient the right dose for them, which may be more or less than an anesthesiologist routinely uses,"" said Sessler, who serves as a consultant for Medasense. ""When patients receive the right amount of pain medication for them as individuals, they should awaken quickly and without severe pain.""\n\nWhen patients receive the right amount of pain medication for them as individuals, they should awaken quickly and without severe pain.\n\nThere are some limitations to the PMD-200. Clinical trials have not consistently shown that NOL monitoring during surgery reduces short-term or long-term pain for patients. More research would be needed before NOL monitoring could become the standard of care.\n\n""We believe that NOL monitoring can improve postoperative pain, but studies so far have been underwhelming,"" Sessler said. ""There also have not been many studies, and more are clearly needed.""\n\nSome anesthesia experts have warned against treating patients based on a machine-provided number instead of their clinical condition--especially given the potential dangers of opioid overuse.\n\n""When we start treating numbers, and we don\'t necessarily get good outcomes from it, we have to ask, what is this adding?"" Gulur said. ""We have an opioid epidemic. We don\'t want to use more opioids than necessary, especially if we do not see their benefits.""\n\nWith more research, though, it\'s possible that NOL monitoring technology could be used outside of the operating room as well.\n\nFor example, patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who need a breathing tube and ventilator are often given sedating medications to ease their discomfort.\n\n""We saw NOL monitoring used in critical care during COVID,"" Zuckerman Stark said. ""Critical care patients are sedated just like surgery patients, but for days or weeks. We were concerned to see the amounts of opioids patients in the ICU were receiving over time.""\n\nEventually, NOL could even be useful outside of the hospital. While the device would look different, the same algorithms can be used to help non-speaking individuals indicate they are in pain. It could also be used to better respond to chronic pain.\n\nResearchers are exploring new ways to monitor pain during and after surgery. If you\'ll be having surgery, talk to your provider about how your pain will be managed. While medications can be effective, they have risks. There are also non-medication ways to manage pain after surgery that may help. https://www.verywellhealth.com/monitoring-pain-response-reduces-pain-during-and-after-surgery-7377220"

" About David Attenborough presents seven of the most remarkable animal songs found in nature and explores the significance of these songs in the lives of their species. Each one – from the song of the largest lemur to the song of the humpback whale to the song of the lyrebird – was recorded in his lifetime. But will they soon be heard no more? Contrary to Charles Darwin\'s theory of sexual selection, a new generation of scientists have discovered that animal song is not just the domain of males. Scientists are learning that most female songbirds also sing, and it is only now they are being properly heard. Through this revelation and others, discover how animal songs are essential for survival. Joyous, surprising and poignant, this story of pioneering research and astounding insight is a chorus of wonder – and a wake-up call.\n\nSongbirds make up half of the 10,000 species of birds and have the most advanced vocal organs in the entire natural world.\n\nNo one yet knows why humpback whales sing, but in 1970, an album recording of their songs sparked the ""Save the Whales"" movement to protect the species.\n\nIn the UK, it\'s estimated that 38 million birds have disappeared from the skies in the last 60 years. Climate change and habitat deterioration are the main factors behind this catastrophic decline.\n\nIn 1960, a young David Attenborough helped capture the first ever audio of Madagascar\'s largest lemur, the indri. Using a battery powered portable tape recorder, he played the sounds back to the lemurs and was rewarded with responses, which were thought to be a ""keep out"" signal over territory.\n\nThe lyrebird can mimic the sounds of at least 20 different species. One male lyrebird manipulatively uses this to his advantage, mimicking the sound of a flock of birds to convince a nearby female that danger is outside of his realm and that she is better off sticking with him.\n\nIt was once thought that only male songbirds were capable of song. However, in 64 percent of all songbird species, the females sing. Professor Naomi Langmore first made this discovery by recording a female fairy wren singing to defend her territory. https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/about-attenboroughs-wonder-song/28798/"
"Mexico immigration agency chief to be charged over deadly fire Mexico has opened criminal proceedings against a top immigration official over a fire that killed 40 migrants in Ciudad Juarez last month, with prosecutors saying he was remiss in not preventing the disaster despite earlier indications of problems at the detention centres run by the agency.\n\nThe decision to file charges against Francisco Garduño, the head of Mexico\'s National Immigration Institute, was announced on Tuesday by the federal attorney general\'s office.\n\nIt followed repeated calls from within Mexico, and from some Central American nations, not to stop the case at the five low-level officials, guards and a Venezuelan migrant already facing homicide charges in the case.\n\nAnger initially focused on two guards who were seen fleeing the March 27 fire, without unlocking the cell door to allow the migrants to escape. But President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said earlier on Tuesday that they did not have the keys.\n\nThe attorney general\'s office said several other officers of Garduño\'s agency will also face charges for failing to carry out their duties, the statement said, but prosecutors did not explain specific charges or identify the officials.\n\nProsecutors said the case showed a ""pattern of irresponsibility"".\n\nThe press office of the immigration agency that Garduño heads did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nProsecutors said after a fire at another detention centre in the gulf coast state of Tabasco that killed one person and injured 14 in 2020, the immigration agency knew there were problems, which needed to be corrected but alleged they failed to act.\n\nThere have long been complaints of corruption and bad conditions at Mexico\'s migrant detention facilities, but they have never been seriously addressed.\n\nLópez Obrador\'s comments about the guards in last month\'s fire in the border city of Ciudad Juarez came on the same day that the bodies of 17 Guatemala migrants and six Hondurans killed in the fire were flown back to their home countries.\n\nIt was unclear what effect López Obrador\'s comments might have on the trial of the guards, who were arrested previously over the fire.\n\n""The door was closed because the person who had the keys wasn\'t there,"" López Obrador said.\n\nA video from a security camera inside the facility shows guards walking away when the fire started in late March inside the cell holding migrants.\n\nThe guards are seen hurrying away as smoke fills the facility, and they did not appear to make any effort to release the migrants.\n\nThree Mexican immigration officials, a guard and a Venezuelan migrant are being held for investigation in connection with the fire. They face homicide charges.\n\nThe migrant allegedly set fire to foam mattresses at the detention centre to protest against what he apparently thought were plans to move or deport the migrants.\n\nIn Guatemala City, relatives of the victims gathered at an air force base with flowers and photos of the deceased to mark their return.\n\n""My son, my love,"" a female voice could be heard calling out, amid sobs from those present as the coffins were unloaded and placed in a line, and relatives were allowed to approach them.\n\nMexican military planes carried the bodies of six migrants to Honduras and 17 to Guatemala. Authorities say 19 of the 40 dead were from Guatemala, but two bodies were still in the process of having their identities confirmed.\n\nAn additional 11 Guatemalans were injured in the fire.\n\nGuatemalan Foreign Minister Mario Búcaro accompanied the bodies, which were to be taken overland to their hometowns in nine different provinces.\n\nSome bodies of Salvadoran migrants were returned to El Salvador last week. So far, 31 bodies have been sent back to their home countries. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/mexico-immigration-agency-chief-to-be-charged-over-deadly-fire"
"Russia eyes digital draft as Ukraine war losses mount Russia plans to introduce electronic military draft papers in an effort to make it harder for men to avoid being called up to fight in Ukraine.\n\nThe State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, approved the necessary legislation in two separate votes at lightning speed on Tuesday with near unanimity.\n\nUnder the new proposals, summons will be sent electronically to a potential draftee\'s personal account on the main government portal. They would be considered delivered as soon as delivered electronically.\n\nUnder the legislation, citizens who fail to show up at the military enlistment office will be automatically banned from travelling abroad and face a raft of other restrictions to complicate their lives inside Russia.\n\nAndrey Kartapolov, chairman of the defence committee, said the new rules would apply not only to young conscripts but all men liable for military service.\n\n""The draft notice is considered received from the moment it is posted in the personal account of a person liable for military service,"" Kartapolov said in televised remarks.\n\nThe move is part of a wider push by Moscow to perfect a system it has used to bolster its military forces in Ukraine, though government officials say there are currently no plans to compel more men to fight there.\n\nThe new draft regime will close numerous loopholes exploited by draft dodgers and give Russia the organisational infrastructure to carry out a much more thorough and wider mobilisation campaign – if and when it decides to do so.\n\nSome politicians complained the changes were rushed through without giving them enough time for scrutiny.\n\nNina Ostanina of the Communist Party said many lawmakers did not have time to study dozens of pages of the proposals. ""We all bear responsibility for this bill,"" she said in parliament.\n\nAnother Communist, Artyom Prokofyev, asked why the bill was being adopted under ""such a veil of secrecy"".\n\nBut Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house, urged parliamentarians to avoid ""sabotaging"" the readings.\n\nThe changes still need to be approved by the upper house – which is also expected to vote in its favour by a large margin – and by President Vladimir Putin, before they take effect. Both steps are expected in the coming days.\n\nRussia says it mobilised about 300,000 men last year to help it prosecute what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, but is now focused on trying to recruit professional volunteer soldiers via an advertising campaign.\n\n""We need to perfect and modernise the military call-up system,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a news briefing, recalling ""problems"" experienced last year with the mobilisation campaign.\n\nThe initial decision to introduce mobilisation for the first time since World War II prompted tens of thousands of draft-age men to flee abroad, while some protests broke out – and were swiftly suppressed – in multiple Russian cities.\n\n""Now, with just one click, it is possible to send almost everyone to the trenches,"" StalinGulag, one of Russia\'s most popular opposition bloggers, wrote on social media.\n\nHe warned many officials would be tempted to disregard disqualifying conditions for military service, including health or family circumstances.\n\n""You will be talking about your flat feet or three children including children with disabilities somewhere near Bakhmut,"" said the anti-Kremlin blogger, referring to the front-line hotspot in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThousands of Russian soldiers and mercenaries have reportedly been killed in the months-long battle for Bakhmut.\n\nPeskov dismissed suggestions the digitalisation plans might prompt a further wave of panic and emigration among young male Russians keen to avoid having to fight in Ukraine.\n\n""[This plan] is not connected to mobilisation,"" he said, repeating previous assurances there were no plans for a second wave of mass conscription.\n\nUnder the current system, men targeted by military recruiters are hand-delivered paper summons at their registered addresses or places of work, which they are required to sign for personally.\n\nRecruiters have sometimes struggled to deliver the papers and to know if they have the right address for a draftee.\n\nThe Kremlin last year pledged to fix ""mistakes"" in its initial mobilisation campaign that saw men who were ineligible for the draft because of age or medical conditions being called up to fight in Ukraine. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/russia-eyes-digital-draft-as-ukraine-war-losses-mount"

Gun enthusiasts have described it as ""one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi."" By contrast, gun violence prevention groups like Everytown have billed the state\'s laws as ""among the worst in the country.""\n\nKentucky is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun.\n\n""Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there\'s no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they\'re ever used in a crime,"" CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit outlet focused exclusively on gun violence, said.\n\n""Red flag"" laws, found in more than a dozen states across the US, allow courts to temporarily revoke firearm ownership by anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. They too are nonexistent in Kentucky, Mascia pointed out.\n\nIf the Louisville mass shooter\'s behavior ""had aroused suspicion among family members, it would have possibly resulted in him being disarmed or at least a visit from law enforcement, which could have derailed his plans,"" she said.\n\nPrior to 2019 – when Kentucky allowed firearms to be carried without a concealed carry permit – individuals had to prove they knew how to fire a gun. ""They actually had to pass a shooting test. So, you went to a shooting range and you had to make 11 out of 20 shots on a target in front of an instructor,"" Mascia said. The state eliminated the requirement when permitless carry was adopted, making anyone eligible over the age of 21 able to lawfully possess a firearm to conceal their deadly weapon in public without officially demonstrating they know how to use it.\n\nAccording to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, there\'s no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its physical transfer to the buyer in Kentucky, whereas some states require a waiting period ranging anywhere from 72 hours to 14 days before the weapon is handed over.\n\nGun deaths across Kentucky in 2021 were 25% greater than in 2018, the year before permitless carry was allowed in the state, Mascia, said, adding gun homicides during the same time period were up 75%, which she said bucks the idea advanced by gun proponents that the best solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nWhile federal and state law prohibits convicted felons from gun possession, in Kentucky, domestic abusers on restraining orders, stalkers, fugitives, individuals convicted of hate crimes, and people found to be a danger to themselves or others all have legal access to guns, according to Everytown.\n\nIn an emotionally charged press conference Tuesday, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, US Representative Morgan McGarvey and University of Louisville Health Chief Medical Officer Jason Smith called for city, state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence.\n\n""The laws we have now are enabling violence and murder,"" the mayor said, and slammed a state law that requires law enforcement to put seized firearms up for auction to federally licensed firearms dealers holding a license appropriate for the type of firearm sold. Under Kentucky law, certain confiscated guns that are not retained for official use ""shall be sold at public auction,"" with partial proceeds going to public safety programs.\n\n""Think about that: that murder weapon will be back on the streets one day,"" Greenberg said. ""It\'s time to change this law and let us destroy illegal guns and destroy the guns that have been used to kill our friends and kill our neighbors.""\n\n""We have to take action now. We need short term action to end this gun violence epidemic now, so fewer people die on our streets and in our banks in our schools,"" the mayor added. ""I don\'t care about finger pointing. I don\'t care about blame. I don\'t care about politics. I\'m only interested in working together with our state legislators to take meaningful action to save lives to prevent more tragic injuries, and more death. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/us/kentucky-gun-laws/index.html"

"Wind Energy Market to Exceed 1 TW of Installed Capacity by 2023 End, Wood Mackenzie Says The global wind energy market will pass the one terawatt (TW) threshold for installed capacity by the end of 2023, according to the latest market outlook from Wood Mackenzie.\n\n""After needing more than 40 years to reach one TW of installations, the wind industry will reach the next TW of installations within the next eight years, a significant acceleration of growth,"" said Luke Lewandowski, Wood Mackenzie Research Director.\n\nThe next decade, Woodmac says, will also see an intensified focus on offshore wind as the sector matures and technology innovation and supply chain development help make offshore development more accessible in different regions. The global offshore wind sector will experience sevenfold growth by 2032 and account for a 26% share of total capacity over the ten-year outlook.\n\nDevelopers will add offshore capacity in 30 countries in the coming decade, though European countries and China account for 81% of global offshore capacity additions over the 10-year outlook, according to Wood Mackenzie findings.\n\n""If we take a closer look at China, new grid-connected capacity in the region dropped 21% year-over-year (YoY) in 2022, primarily due to a strict lockdown policy that significantly limited capacity additions in Q4,"" Lewandowski said. ""The projects unable to connect in Q4 will help boost the outlook in China for 2023.""\n\nAccording to Wood Mackenzie, the China wind power market will rebound strongly in 2023, with developers nearly doubling the amount of annual capacity YoY, on the back of a record year for new wind turbine orders in the country. Over the 10-year outlook, annual capacity additions in China will average 80 GW and account for 50% of new capacity globally.\n\nExcluding China, the rest of the world added 44 GW in 2022, a 4% decrease YoY. A challenging mix of inflation and supply chain disruption caused more than 3 GW of projects to delay into 2023 and beyond, providing a boost to the near-term outlook.\n\n""For the US, developers await tax credit eligibility guidance from the US Treasury, with the ongoing uncertainty impacting near-term installations. However, with policy clarity, approval and investment in transmission projects, and development of the offshore market\'s nascent supply chain, annual additions will intensify and average 20 GW per year from 2026 through 2032,"" Lewandowski added.\n\nOver the 10-year outlook, more than 343 GW of offshore and onshore capacity will be added in Europe, as the energy crisis has motivated several countries to strengthen existing capacity targets, the energy intelligence group said.\n\nAccording to Wood Mackenzie, offshore wind will account for 39% of new capacity, although onshore growth in emerging markets in Eastern Europe and the repowering of aging fleets in more mature markets, including Germany and Spain, will also contribute.\n\nWood Mackenzie sees green hydrogen as supporting demand in the Middle East and Africa, resulting in 72 GW of total capacity additions over the 10-year forecast.\n\nDevelopment in the region remains modest in the near-term but will surpass the 5 GW annual mark in 2025 and continue momentum through 2032, with an average annual growth rate of 42% for the forecast period.\n\n""Unprecedented decarbonization and energy security policy support in the US and Europe will help the industry recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These markets will also experience a renewed focus on repowering in order to revitalize the assets that were constructed in the early years of the industry\'s journey to 1 TW,"" Lewandowski concluded. https://www.oedigital.com/news/504271-wind-energy-market-to-exceed-1-tw-of-installed-capacity-by-2023-end-wood-mackenzie-says"

"What Gavin Newsom's 'Make America California' tour conveniently ignored Fox News host Tucker Carlson examines why President Biden has not announced his 2024 re-election campaign and why California Gov. Gavin Newsom is likely to become the face of the Democratic Party on \'Tucker Carlson Tonight.\'\n\nWith a new political PAC designed to ""fight back"" against how Republican-led states are governed, California Governor Gavin Newsom has once again turned a blind eye to the mounting problems in his own state in favor of demonizing red states that are doing just fine without him. His lack of awareness about his own record of failures was on full display as he recently toured Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama to lecture them on California\'s supposedly superior way of life.\n\nHe called Republican leaders ""authoritarian threats"" while conveniently glossing over his own unilateral power grab during the pandemic. While enacting a three-years long state of emergency, Newsom shut down schools longer than any other state, shut down businesses that forced thousands to permanently close their doors and put many Californians out of work, kept masks on kids despite not wanting to wear his own, and dictated how many households can gather together at once – a rule he famously ignored.\n\nNewsom lambasts red state leaders for so-called bans while conveniently forgetting the many essentials he and California Democrats will no longer allow. He failed to mention that state-funded travel is banned to 23 states, including the four he visited on his tour. He didn\'t disclose that the sale of gas-powered cars will be banned in 2035. And he certainly didn\'t discuss that even skittles may not be safe from a ban in California.\n\nIf Newsom really wants to warn against authoritarian leadership, there\'s no better place to start than with himself.\n\nREPUBLICANS BLAST GAVIN NEWSOM\'S PLAN TO MANDATE ELECTRIC TRUCKS\n\nNewsom also tried to present himself as a guiding light on issues like education while never mentioning the dire straits schools in his home state are currently in. Students needlessly suffered as a result of Newsom\'s extended school shutdowns. Recent test scores showed two thirds or more of California students aren\'t at grade level in math and science while California ranks dead last in literacy. Meanwhile, public school enrollment continues to decline as families relocate, many to the very states Newsom is busy lecturing.\n\nOn his red state tour, Newsom failed to bring up critical issues from his home state like homelessness. That\'s undoubtedly because on his watch California\'s homeless crisis has exploded, despite allocating more than $20 billion to address it. Today, California holds more than 30 percent of the nation\'s homeless population, including a staggering 50 percent of the nation\'s unsheltered population.\n\nHe didn\'t bring up California\'s struggling economy and its unemployment rate that ranks among the highest in the nation. The four states he visited enjoy much lower unemployment rates, with Florida and Alabama even landing near the lowest of any state. Nor did he mention how his poor policies and reckless spending managed to drop California from a $100 billion surplus to a nearly $30 billion deficit in just one year.\n\nGas prices certainly weren\'t addressed, seeing as California continuously has the highest prices in the nation, towering high above the national average and nearing $5 per gallon. Not surprisingly, the states he visited have among the nation\'s lowest prices with Mississippi and Arkansas boasting the nation\'s least expensive gas. Instead of finding commonsense solutions to lower gas prices, like suspending California\'s sky high gas tax, Newsom recently championed a new gas tax that will likely lead to even higher prices hitting already cash-strapped Californians.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCalifornia Gov.

Over the last two years, 700,000 Californians have fled the state, a larger exodus than any other state in the nation, with many citing California\'s housing affordability crisis as a reason for leaving.\n\nSo where are they going? More economically welcoming red states like Florida and Texas gained more new residents than anywhere else. It\'s not by accident that California lost a Congressional seat for the first time in state history while Florida and Texas both picked up seats.\n\nCalifornia is not the moral compass for the rest of the nation that Gavin Newsom pretends it is. He can exhaust himself lecturing red states all he wants, but the only lesson he can credibly impart to them is how to drive their states to the top of all the wrong lists. Whether this is his pathetic kickoff to a soon-to-be failed presidential race or he\'s simply trying to distract himself from the many problems he\'s worsened back home, he should really ask himself if he\'s the best person to lecture anyone on how to effectively lead.

"District Attorney Alvin Bragg sues Rep. Jim Jordan for being Donald Trump's friend Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has some nerve filing a lawsuit against Republican Rep. Jim Jordan. Some nerve, indeed.\n\nJordan is just out there in Congress, heading up the House Judiciary Committee, being a totally not-unhinged dude who never wears a sport coat. And like any good pal, he\'s trying his darnedest to do his best friend Donald Trump a solid. In this case, that solid involves mucking around with Bragg\'s prosecution of the former president on charges he falsified business records while paying hush money to an adult film star.\n\nWho among us wouldn\'t do the same for a friend who had been indicted by a grand jury on 34 felony counts involving, again, hush money paid to an adult film star? We\'ve all been there, and we all know THAT\'S the moment when a real best friend steps up.\n\nJordan stepped up by launching an investigation into Bragg\'s case, subpoenaing a former prosecutor from the district attorney\'s office and demanding answers. Is it common for federal lawmakers to tamper with state-level criminal investigations? No, but Jordan is not your common federal lawmaker.\n\nIn fact, he already asserted that Trump was indicted ""for no crime,"" so Jordan is more of a ""federal lawmaker/state law-decider"" hybrid. He\'s like the Terminator if the Terminator was sent from the future to destroy, at any cost, all legal problems that make the former president look bad.\n\nBragg should have responded to Jordan\'s totally nonbiased investigation into how innocent Trump is by inviting House Judiciary Committee members – only the ones who have pledged fealty to Trump – over to view the entirety of the state investigation. But instead, Bragg rudely filed a lawsuit accusing Jordan of a ""brazen and unconstitutional attack.""\n\nPer the lawsuit: ""Congress has no power to supervise state criminal prosecutions.""\n\nBragg went on to cite an array of so-called Supreme Court cases that found things like ""the Constitution \'(with)held from Congress a plenary police power\',"" and ""federal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States\' sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.""\n\nBlah, blah, blah. I don\'t remember reading anything like that in the copy of the Constitution I bought at the Mar-a-Lago gift shop.\n\nSmartly, Jordan leaned on his vast knowledge of law and words to turn the tables on Bragg during a Fox News interview, saying of the lawsuit: ""They\'re obstructing our constitutional duty to do oversight.""\n\nIn legal circles, that\'s known as the ""I\'m Not Doing Anything Wrong, YOU ARE!"" strategy.\n\nLook, Mr. District Attorney, all Jordan and his posse comitrumpus want to do is ""do oversight."" They have a duty to do oversight, and nothing will stop them from doing it. The oversight, I mean.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee chair, who not long ago ignored a congressional subpoena because subpoenas don\'t count when Democrats do them, went on to say: ""Alvin Bragg used federal funds to indict a former president for no crime.""\n\nDid Bragg use federal funds in the Trump hush money investigation? Well, if you want to get technical, no. The district attorney\'s office said $5,000 in federal asset forfeiture funds were used in other investigations into Trump under the previous district attorney.\n\nAnd did Bragg alone indict the former president? No, a grand jury made up of New York citizens heard the evidence and made the decision to indict.\n\nAnd was Trump indicted ""for no crime""? Again, no, not if you want to get hung up on technicalities, like the fact that he was indicted for 34 crimes and, while innocent until proven guilty, will proceed through the criminal justice system like any other American.\n\nBut at the end of the day, remember, Jordan is Trump\'s best friend, or at least he hopes he is. The congressman is also a staunch conservative, and if there\'s one thing we know about conservatives it\'s that they hate states\' rights.\n\nIt\'s not like in 1980, a presidential candidate named Ronald Reagan told a crowd in Mississippi: ""I believe in states\' rights. I believe in people doing as much as they can for themselves at the community level and at the private level, and I believe we\'ve distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended in the Constitution to that federal establishment.""\n\nNo way Reagan would utter that kind of liberal jibber-jabber?\n\nJordan is simply living out the longstanding Republican belief that the federal government can intervene in any state issue, as long as it\'s doing so in support of a fellow Republican. (That part IS in the Constitution I bought at Mar-a-Lago!)\n\nSo I\'ll say again, how dare Bragg file a lawsuit against Jordan. The congressman is only doing his (Mar-a-Lago) constitutional duty and making sure presidential candidate Trump isn\'t unfairly prosecuted for a noncrime he definitely handsomely did not commit. No bias! All Jordan is seeking are the facts, which he will fabricate and then talk about on Fox News.\n\nThat\'s what friends are for.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Twitter @RexHuppke and Facebook facebook.com/RexIsAJerk https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2023/04/12/manhattan-da-alvin-bragg-files-lawsuit-against-rep-jim-jordan/11643868002/"
"How a battle for Congress in the cushy Arizona suburbs could change American politics The newly created 1st Congressional District in Arizona reflects the tectonic shifts underway in American politics.\n\nHeld now by Republican David Schweikert, serving his seventh term in Congress, it\'s a place of affluence, with luxury homes and well-manicured landscapes throughout Scottsdale, Cave Creek, Paradise Valley and parts of north Phoenix.\n\nThese cushy suburbs were once the stronghold of Arizona Republicans, but no more. With the advent of Donald Trump and the beginning of a new political era in America, the wealthy suburbs have been moving toward the Democrats.\n\nWe are witnessing the ""migration of the educated and affluent to the Democrats"" while the ""white working class and more recently a minority of the non-white working class"" migrate to the Republicans, as the writer Michael Lind, a columnist for UnHerd and Tablet magazines, puts it. https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2023/04/12/arizona-congressional-race-shift-politics-democrats-republicans-2024/11642300002/?gnt-cfr=1"

"Why Is Canadian City Winnipeg Booming Located in the state of Manitoba, which is twice the size of the United Kingdom, while Canada is 18 times the size of France, the history of Winnipeg is linked with trade fur. The city is connected by Hudson Bay via its lakes and rivers. At the frontier of the Great Plains and the Canadian shield, right in the middle of the geographic center of North America, the city appears to be a quiet city with its immense, monotonous and flat landscape. But not really.\n\nManitoba Legislative Building and Skyline\n\nThe city which counts about 750,000 inhabitants is very active and attractive. Compared to Toronto and Vancouver which have become overcrowded, Winnipeg enjoys natural surroundings which definitely have a positive impact on its development. With its direct flights from Los Angeles, Minneapolis or Canadian cities like Vancouver and Toronto, Winnipeg is easily accessible.\n\nMPG Small World, Big Impact campaign\n\nFounded in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1986, Mondetta Clothing was established when technological advancements in telecommunications linked citizens of the planet more closely than ever before. The brand, Mondetta, with a name that combined the French word ""monde"" (world) with the Latin suffix ""etta"" (small), reflected the shift to a global village by creating flag-themed clothing that illustrated most people were \'from\' more than just any one place or country. Today, Mondetta Clothing is still headquartered in Winnipeg, with 150 employees from over 40 diverse cultural backgrounds, of which 60% are female.\n\nAsh Modha, founder and CEO of the company, came to Winnipeg with his family from East Africa following their expulsion from their homeland, Uganda by the dictator Idi Amin. Modha and his family arrived in Winnipeg as refugees in 1972. Then, as a teen still in high school, he started the company with his brother and two friends, putting everything they had into the venture to make it a success. Throughout the years, Mondetta has evolved from a humble Canadian sportswear brand to a global leader in technically sustainable lifestyle activewear. Modha and his partners are proud of their journey. ""We have made it this far through hard work, tenacity, and resilience. When many companies have either gone bankrupt or closed down, we have competed internationally by creating a company that has remained at the forefront of the fashion industry by being ahead in compliance and processes,"" replied Modha when asked to share the secret behind his company\'s longevity.\n\nMPG Small World, Big Impact campaign\n\nWhile Mondetta started with iconic, socially-conscious flag-themed apparel that espoused ""a spirit of unification"" their Mondetta Performance Gear (MPG) brand creates ethical and essential active lifestyle clothing that fuses stylish design with everyday functionality, made for whichever way the modern individual chooses to get moving and stay in shape. Since January 2021, Mondetta Clothing has become one of just nine Certified B Corporations in the Canadian apparel industry. ""We are working towards mapping and developing a company that is working towards Net Zero Certification"" said Modha. As a certified B Corp, Mondetta, and its subdivisions, including MPG, are continually committed to higher social and environmental performance standards, transparency, and accountability. Other brands may inflate their prices due to the added cost of pursuing sustainability, but Mondetta and MPG do not. They ensure their clothing remains attainably priced, featuring the same high-quality materials and attention to detail customers have come to know and trust. ""Fashion, quality, and attainable prices have always been at the forefront of our designs and product development, and by remaining true to those principles, we have been able to create an activewear brand perfect for both the elite athlete and for those engaged in fitness as part of their everyday life"" concluded the CEO. MPG is ethical, responsible, and attainably priced. Major retailers across Canada and the US include Sporting Life, REI, MEC, Paragon, and MPG sells through their e-commerce site.\n\nInside Raw Almond pop up structure\n\nWhile temperature gets very cold in winter, enjoying dinner in a very stylish tent on the frozen rivers of Winnipeg is possible. At the confluence of Red and Assiniboine rivers, Raw Almond is a fine dining festival, created in 2013, in a stylish pop up restaurant. An experience to celebrate good food - as it gathers the best chefs from Canada-, in a beautiful winter wonderland design setting.\n\nRaw Almond structure\n\nCanadian Museum for Human Rights\n\nCanadian Museum for Human Rights\n\nIt is the only museum devoted to human rights for all. The museum opened in 2014, it was the first ever national museum built outside the capital region. The brainchild of Canadian business magnate Israel Asper, the impressive building explores the subject of human rights on a large scale and promotes respect for others. American architect based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Antoine Predock created this exceptional space finding its main inspiration in the natural landscapes of Canada.

"Maersk Supply Service and GustoMSC to Design Innovative Wind Installation Vessel for European Waters Danish offshore vessel operator Maersk Supply Service has entered a collaboration with the Dutch vessel designer GustoMSC to design the ""next generation"" Wind Installation Vessel.\n\nMaersk Supply Service, which is already building an offshore wind installation vessel for the U.S. market, said Tuesday the aim of the latest collaboration with GustoMSC was to create an ""upgraded version that is fit for purpose for the growing offshore wind market in Europe.""\n\n""The new design will build on the same patent and characteristics of the current feeder concept, which was designed to operate in US waters. This unique patented design will allow the jack-up Wind Installation Vessel to stay on location at the wind park, while only tugs and barges sail back and forth from port to collect the wind turbine tower, nacelle, and blades,"" Maersk Supply Service said.\n\nThis cost-competitive concept is expected to be more than 30% more efficient than conventional jack-up vessels. Additionally, this solution will be less weather-dependent, enabling continuous installations year-round, Maersk Supply Service said.\n\nCombined, these elements will contribute to improving operational efficiency and lower levelised costs of energy from offshore wind.\n\n""Europe is an attractive market for offshore wind, and we believe that our concept is also suitable for this region. As the Wind Installation Vessel itself does not sail into ports, this can solve some of the bottlenecks we currently see in Europe, where only a few ports are large enough to handle the growing wind turbine sizes. We look forward to collaborating with GustoMSC on getting this new basic design ready,"" says the Chief Commercial Officer at Maersk Supply Service, Jonas Munch Agerskov.\n\nManaging Director GustoMSC, Nils van Nood said: ""Against the backdrop of growing turbine sizes, we jointly aim to further improve installation efficiencies and development economics in the bottom-fixed offshore wind market."", says\n\nMaersk Supply Service and GuscoMSC will start the basic design process shortly and expect to conclude it later in 2023. https://www.oedigital.com/news/504262-maersk-supply-service-and-gustomsc-to-design-innovative-wind-installation-vessel-for-european-waters"

"In search of Ramadan with South Africa's men who sight the moon Cape Town, South Africa - The digital clock on Shaykh Safwaan Sasman\'s smartphone turns 18.59, and the 32-year-old looks up. Beside him, a dozen other men in thobes and matching black puffer jackets embroidered with the words \'Crescent Observers\' stand in silence, staring at the sky.\n\nA splash of orangey-red streaks across the horizon, announcing the dusk. Below, the Atlantic laps the coastline; a midweek stream of joggers and cyclists shuffle across Cape Town\'s Sea Point promenade; and families relax while children play on the grass.\n\nIn the 37 minutes between the sun setting and the moon slipping below the horizon, the maankykers (Afrikaans for moon sighters) of South Africa\'s Crescent Observers Society are on the clock - working to spot the crescent and announce whether the first day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan will begin.\n\nFor more than 70 years, maankykers have stood in this same spot, anchoring their gaze to a fixed star on the horizon, before scanning the skies around it.\n\n""See with the naked eye,"" says Imam Yusuf Pandy, a slight, bespectacled 82-year-old in a pristine white thobe, black coat and Palestinian keffiyeh draped around his head. He explains the classical Islamic view of the Sunnah, or prophetic tradition, of announcing the start of the next month. ""Not with a telescope, but it must be with the eye,"" says the oldest and longest-serving active member of the group.\n\nPandy was chairperson of the all-voluntary maankykers for over 40 years, before handing the position over to Sasman in 2020 and assuming a more honourary role as president. But he has not slowed down, still spending weeks analysing the maps and astronomical data he has neatly stored in files in his home in Lansdowne, before travelling 19km (12 miles) to Three Anchor Bay on the day of the sighting to watch the sky for himself.\n\nThe number of maankykers varies, with men joining up, and occasionally leaving, at different times. Currently, about 30 active members are split between four main viewing sites across the Western Cape. Every month, dutifully and consistently, they venture out - ""literally come rain or shine"", says Sasman - even amid COVID lockdowns, controversy about whether or not a moon was seen, or intercommunity squabbles about the ideal way to do their job.\n\nHis eyes still on the horizon, Sasman furrows his brow beneath half-rim glasses, seeing more than just a striking sunset. ""There is a thick haze on the horizon so it\'s going to be a little bit challenging ..."" he trails off, adjusting the Kashmiri shawl on his shoulders and briefly scrolling through his phone.\n\nNearby, Moulana Abdul Khaliq Allie of the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC), the body in Cape Town responsible for ensuring a moon sighting is Sharia or Islamic-law compliant, gets updates from other parts of the country. ""Nationally, they haven\'t seen anything,"" he tells Sasman, ""but they have seen in the neighbouring countries.""\n\nBehind them, a man sounds the adhan, or Muslim call to prayer, and dozens of families who arrived to witness the sighting remove their shoes, place their prayer mats on the grass and face northeast towards Mecca.\n\nThe maankykers, some with prayer mats under their arms to use once their main task is done, inch forward to give the congregation more room - their focus never leaving the sky.\n\n""We have 37 minutes, three minutes have passed. At 7.36, we must be done,"" Sasman, who in his day job works as a Sharia compliance auditor for the MJC\'s Halaal Trust, reminds the others, before picking up his mobile phone to call the captain of the second viewing site at a nearby vantage point on Signal Hill. https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2023/4/12/south-africa-men-who-sight-the-moon"
"FC Barcelona Interested In Signing Brazilian Fluminense Ace Kaua Elias: Reports FC Barcelona are reportedly interested in signing Fluminense striker Kaua Elias.\n\nFC Barcelona are interested in possibly signing Brazilian teen sensation Kaua Elias, according to SPORT.\n\nLike another Barca target in Athletico Paranaense striker Vitor Roque, Elias impressed at the recent U-17 South American Championship in Ecuador where he scored two braces in eventual champions Brazil\'s opening two games against the hosts and Chile.\n\nAccording to SPORT, a Barcelona scout that was present at the tournament took ""very good note"" of Elias, who stands out for his 1.80m height, strong physicality, great finishing, and nose for goalscoring.\n\nThe 17-year-old center-forward can also play with both feet, has excellent technique, and is adept at operating in tight spaces and exploding in quick transitions.\n\nHailing from Uberlandia in Minas Gerais, Elias was scouted by Fluminense in 2016 and progressed through its famed Xerem academy as the top scorer in a series of international competitions the Rio club commonly plays.\n\nIn June 2021, Elias signed his first professional contract with Fluminense which has him secure until 2027 with a release clause worth 280 million Brazilian reais ($56 million) according to Globo.\n\nThis is of course higher than the price tag Athletico Paranaense have put on Vitor Roque over in Curitiba, yet Elias is expected to move on before his terms expire when he comes of adult age in 2024 and might end up cheaper.\n\nBarca could hold off on trying to sign Roque this summer, and get their financial house in order to launch an assault on Fluminense for Elias next year.\n\nIn times when the Catalans are mired in debts and have been warned to shave €200 million ($218 million) from the wage bill, raising the funds for a big purchase of this magnitude will be a tall order in the coming months.\n\nTo even consider pulling off such a coup, Barca will have to look at offloading one of their underperforming wingers in Ansu Fati, Raphinha and Ferran Torres.\n\nIn recent days, SPORT has reported that Barca will listen to offers for the trio at the same time president Joan Laporta is also considering offloading Robert Lewandowski according to El Nacional. https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2023/04/12/fc-barcelona-interested-in-signing-brazilian-fluminense-ace-kaua-elias-reports/"

"Almost half of AFA team to depart ahead of FPA merger The Association of Financial Advisers (AFA) has detailed the members of its board and leadership team who have decided not to transition over to the new entity.\n\nThe move over to the newly merged Financial Advice Association of Australia (FAAA) was expected to happen at the end of June following a successful vote from AFA members and members of the Financial Planning Association of Australia (FPA) at the end of February.\n\nIt had previously been announced that Sam Perera, AFA president, would not be moving across in order to focus on his own business after three years on the board.\n\nThe association has now also detailed the six other departures it has seen from its 16-strong board and leadership team.\n\nFrom the board, this included AFA Treasurer Samantha Robinson, South Australia and Northern Territory director Jawad Ahmad, and Western Australia director Stephen Knight.\n\nThe three individuals plus Perera would remain on the AFA board until the AFA entity was wound up in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFrom the AFA\'s leadership team, departures included Candice Spence, general manager for marketing; Matthew Wallis as partnership manager; and finance manager Andrew Cooke.\n\nRemaining leadership team members, membership and marketing manager Will Burton, events manager Melissa Favaloro, member services officer Hayden Baulch and manager of education, policy and professionalism Caz Garrard would join the FAAA.\n\nThe association\'s AFA Foundation and AFA Investment Fund would also be wound up as part of the transition over the next three months.\n\nRegarding the AFA Foundation, the organisation had agreed to join the FPA\'s Future2 Foundation, alongside the Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) Association. This would mean Future2 was the charitable foundation of choice for financial services professionals.\n\n""Future2 have been doing incredible work at a grassroots level, assisting many worthy charities or causes with their Grants program over many years. Consolidating foundations will allow more Australians to benefit from the generosity of donors,"" said AFA Foundation chair David Slovinec.\n\nRegarding membership, all AFA members who had paid for a membership period that extended beyond 30 June 2023 would get a credit towards their fees with the FAAA or a refund if they opted not to move. Members would receive an invitation to join the FAAA around mid-May.\n\nResearch by Wealth Data found that if all AFA and FPA members voted to join the FAAA, its membership would represent over half of the Financial Advisers Register. https://www.moneymanagement.com.au/news/financial-planning/almost-half-afa-team-depart-ahead-fpa-merger"
"AI presents greater threat than climate change: Alphinity Getting the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) wrong could present a greater problem than climate change, according to Alphinity, and should be considered as part of an ESG application.\n\nSpeaking on a Fidante podcast, Mary Manning, portfolio manager on the Global Sustainability fund at Alphinity discussed the importance of considering AI from an environmental, social and governance (ESG) perspective.\n\nA particular concern of Manning was the development of AI to become sentient with the ability to process thoughts and feelings.\n\n""If you think about AI and the possibility of AI will become sentient at some point, if you think about that over the long term, then if we get AI wrong and robots or sentient beings start to take over, then that is a very big threat to humanity, arguably even more so than climate change.\n\n""That is a very big threat of AI and it gets very little attention.""\n\nShe particularly highlighted stocks such as Microsoft and Google, which both had a chatbot option, Apple and Amazon, which produced smart home devices, self-driving car companies and healthcare companies.\n\nA second concern was that AI was excluded from the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) so it was important for firms to build their own frameworks. For Alphinity, this included assessing AI design, AI application and AI governance.\n\nJessica Cairns, ESG and sustainability manager at Alphinity, said: ""It is important to clarify it is not an ESG risk by itself. AI is a great opportunity for businesses and one we are encouraging businesses to use in their operations.\n\n""But we think about the associated risks linked to AI, whether that\'s AI being applied poorly, using bad data which can incur penalties and fines, exclusions or gender bias, issues with product quality or safety and human rights issues. It is a very complex area so it\'s important to think about a range of ESG issues.""\n\nAlphinity had partnered with Data 61, the digital arm of Australia\'s science agency CSIRO, to produce a research report on the responsible application of AI for investors, and hoped to publish a joint report around September/October 2023 as well as a framework on the risks of AI holdings. https://www.moneymanagement.com.au/news/funds-management/ai-presents-greater-threat-climate-change-alphinity"

We can use this experience to point the way forward,"" he said.\n\n""It\'s clear what can be achieved with commitment and intent. The challenge is now for boards to refocus their attention so we see similar progress can flow through to executive director appointments.""\n\nHowever, the analysis also found this gap significantly increased when looking at ASX 300 executive directors. Of the 341 executive directors, those who also hold the position of CEO or other executive management post, the majority (88.9 per cent) were men.\n\nMoreover, three ASX 200 boards and six ASX 300 boards were all-male.\n\nAccording to Nicola Wakefield Evans, chair of the 30% Club Australia, it was an indication that more needed to be done.\n\n""The lack of women in the c-suite is an issue for boards. Boards are responsible for appointing CEOs and ensuring that a company\'s policies and procedures support equal opportunities for women to progress up the leadership pipeline,"" she said.\n\n""We must continue to work on coordinated and long-term strategies that provide opportunities for women to thrive at all levels of leadership.""\n\nIn December 2022, the AICD Gender Diversity Report had found some 39 per cent of board committees were chaired by women, although this fell when looking at overall board chairs, with 10.5 per cent of ASX 200 companies chaired by women and 11 per cent of ASX 300 companies. https://www.moneymanagement.com.au/news/people-products/gender-diversity-boards-tracking-well-aicd"

While this analysis is shocking, it has become increasingly clear that the Australian economy is not working for most people,"" said Matt Grudnoff, senior economist at the Australia Institute.\n\n""From the 1950s to the 1980s, Australia was considered the land of the fair go and we saw people benefiting more equally from economic growth. Today, that Australian dream has turned into an inequality nightmare, with the maldistribution of economic gains fuelling the cost-of-living crisis for low and middle-income Australians.""\n\nFrom the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008 to the beginning of the pandemic, the top 10 per cent of income earners pocketed 93 per cent of the nation\'s real economic growth per adult.\n\nThis was a massive change from 36 per cent between 1991–08 and 48 per cent from 1982–90, per the author\'s calculations based on the World Inequality Database, and signalled a ""radical reversal"".\n\nGrudnoff added: ""The Stage 3 tax cuts, which see people earning over $180,000 receiving the lion\'s share of benefits while minimum wage workers get nothing, will only make the inequality problem worse.""\n\nThe Stage 3 tax cuts, due to come into effect in July 2024, had previously been supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a way to strengthen economic efficiency and public revenue.\n\nBeyond the ""unfair tax system"", the Australia Institute\'s research identified insecure work, stagnating wages, and soaring profits as causes for the backwards trend.\n\n""Soaring energy prices have seen gas and electricity bills increase for average Australians, while super profits from Australia\'s gas and coal go overseas.

"Higher risk premiums renew interest in hybrid bonds The recent write-off of Credit Suisse\'s AT1 capital notes has made the asset class more lucrative for investors, according to Robeco.\n\nLast month, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) wrote off CHF 16 billion ($25.6 billion) in Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital notes issued by embattled investment bank Credit Suisse.\n\nThe move was designed to ensure local competitor UBS would have enough capital to secure its $4.8 billion acquisition of Credit Suisse, helping to fund costs associated with the takeover.\n\nThe hybrid bond wipeout rattled markets, casting doubt over the security of AT1 investments, particularly off the back of three banking collapses in the United States.\n\nHowever, according to international asset manager Robeco, investors with a higher risk appetite could reap the benefits of recent banking volatility by increasing their exposure to AT1 bonds.\n\n""Robeco Fixed Income did not hold Credit Suisse\'s AT1 bonds -- nor those of Silicon Valley Bank or other Californian banks,"" Robeco noted in its latest analysis. ""The reason we like AT1 now is that these events have increased massively the risk premiums on them."" The asset manager said returns across the AT1 market could prove as lucrative as equity investments, with yields exceeding 8 per cent. ""Equity-like returns are possible in these AT1 bonds. It also shows that equity-like risks are involved in a very adverse, scarce, and idiosyncratic situation,"" Robeco observed.\n\nCentral banks to push global economy into recession Instability in global financial markets was also expected to be the prelude to a ""traditional recession"".

""A fast and aggressive hiking cycle will for sure reveal many problems. Which ones that will be, we don\'t know, but a few real estate and banking accidents would all make sense,"" Robeco observed. Drawing from historical trends, the group said it expected the global economy to slip into recessionary territory later this year. ""All-time series show the recession could start somewhere toward the end of the year -- and we believe central banks will definitely cause one,"" the asset manager noted.\n\nIn the meantime, Victor Verberk, co-head of credits at Robeco, said the firm\'s strategy was to ""buy on dips"". ""Spread markets reflect recession every now and then, driven by yield peaks, financial stress like that of recent weeks, or via an old-fashioned corporate credit crunch,"" Verberk said.

"What does having autism mean? Some individuals with autism have challenges processing senses. Others struggle to communicate. Still others might have a tough time socializing, thinking, physically moving or just going about daily living.\n\nPeople with autism have their own ways of interacting with the world, because autism is a developmental disability that affects everyone who has it a little differently, according to Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia Macdonald distinguished professor of human genetics, neurology and psychiatry at UCLA.\n\nGeschwind has spent 25 years studying autism and what causes it. To mark Autism Awareness Month, CNN talked with him about what autism is and what causes it.\n\nDr. Daniel Geschwind: Autism refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills and social and communication and repetitive behaviors, resistance to changes in routine, or restricted interests. I prefer to call it ""the Autisms,"" because it\'s not one thing, and no two autistic children or adults are exactly alike even though they may share basic features. People with autism may also have some sensory-motor integration issues, especially sensory hypersensitivity.\n\nGeschwind: It isn\'t rare. The most recent statistics (from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) came out in March, pulled data from 11 sites (in the United States) and reported 1 out of every 36 kids is autistic. The study before that estimated around 1 in 40. About 10 years ago, the autism rate was 1 in 100, or even lower.\n\nIt would be easy to look at this trend and say autism is increasing, but that\'s not really what is happening. The most recent data reflects that our ability to recognize autism and diagnose it early has improved dramatically. We\'re now able to diagnose people with autism who might have (previously) fallen through the cracks.\n\nEverybody is neurodivergent to some extent. For example, if you look at a simple IQ test, a substantial portion of people will perform really badly on one specific item. That doesn\'t mean they have problems -- it\'s just that it means we all have strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIf I were being tested on artistic ability, for example, or engineering ability, I would be far below what\'s called typical. I think we have to accept that intelligence is not just one thing, that cognition isn\'t one thing, that there\'s not just one way to behave.\n\nGeschwind: About a decade ago, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" was adopted to encompass everything that we called autism into one rubric. The intent was simply to describe the variability in how people with autism act and behave biomedically. There are some autistic individuals who just need accommodations and don\'t need treatment. There are other autistic individuals who need a lot of treatment. The spectrum was intended to include them all.\n\nOver time, non-autistic people began referring to the spectrum in a linear fashion: high to low. That means some autistic individuals were categorized as ""high-functioning,"" while others were categorized as ""low-functioning."" For many, the notion of a spectrum is now a loaded term. Many believe that instead of talking about autism in a linear fashion, we should talk about it as a wheel or pie, where each slice represents a different trait and every individual has different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGeschwind: There is no cure. At the same time, we\'ve come very far in understanding what autism is, and we\'re making progress on how to treat it. When I started researching autism 25 years ago, the autism rate was 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 2,000. To put it in deeper historical perspective, I think at that time there was only about $10 million a year or less in autism research being done that was funded (by the National Institutes of Health). And so, there was a huge disconnect between the research dollars, public awareness and the real needs of patients and families.\n\nThe notion of the term ""curing"" autism can be controversial. From my perspective, our true goal is to establish a kind of personalized medicine, or precision health in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders, so that each autistic person is seen as the individual they are. We envision a world where individuals who are severely impacted by autism have the opportunity to get therapy and drugs that can help them -- and those for whom a therapy is not warranted or who don\'t want it will have opportunities to live life the way they want to as well. Patient autonomy and societal accommodation are important aspects when considering these issues.\n\nGeschwind: Almost every medical condition has both genetic and environmental components. In autism, it seems that heritability is very high. The most recent large study suggested that heritable genetic factors -- the things that you get from your parents that your parents have in their DNA -- are probably somewhere around 80% or slightly higher.\n\nThat leaves 20% that\'s nonheritable, and of that we know that at least 10% of autism is caused by rare mutations that are not inherited. And that sounds like a paradox, but it\'s not. If you think about Down syndrome, that\'s a genetic mutation that the parents don\'t have in their DNA. That\'s called a new, or de novo, mutation.\n\nYou can calculate a risk score for having autism based on genetics, (but) right now, the risk score for autism is not that predictive because we haven\'t done enough research. For other conditions like cardiovascular or certain cancers, risk scores are very predictive because very large numbers of people have been studied.\n\nEven so, this autism risk score is strongly correlated with high educational attainment, or a high IQ, which again speaks to the strengths associated with being autistic and highlights that we need to be more aware of the strengths that autistic individuals may have as well to optimize their opportunities to achieve their goals or contribute to society.\n\nThere also are several environmental factors that have been shown to increase the risk of autism. One of them is maternal exposure to valproate, which is an anti-epilepsy medication. There are several maternal viral infections that have been associated with autism. And two other things: the interbirth interval -- how quickly after one birth a mother has another -- and the age of the father. The thought on the last point is that as a man ages, their DNA repair mechanisms are maybe less active, and there are more frequent mutations in sperm.\n\nA key point is that all these known environmental factors act prenatally, so in most cases the tendency towards being on the spectrum is something that individuals are born with.\n\nGeschwind: The notion that vaccines cause autism has been entirely (disproved). There have been dozens of studies, using very different methodologies. There is absolutely no evidence that vaccines cause autism, and there\'s been much more harm than good done by purveyors of that fiction.\n\nGeschwind: It is imperative to have an early diagnosis, because we know that early identification and early intervention with behavioral therapies can be effective in up to 50% of kids. Some kids will respond so well that it\'s very hard to make a diagnosis of autism when they\'re 9 years old if the therapy is started early enough.\n\nThe problem is that for many autistic individuals, current therapies are not that effective. There\'s a lot of work being done developing more effective cognitive behavioral therapies, figuring out which therapy is the best for which child. There\'s also work being done to develop medications that can be helpful to treat certain symptoms such as injurious behavior, repetitive behavior or difficulty with changes in routines.\n\nMy colleagues and I want to use treatment to augment and improve people\'s symptoms, not change who they are fundamentally. We believe strongly in every individual\'s autonomy. We also believe in personalized medicine so that it\'s not one-size-fits-all. There will be some patients in whom we\'re trying to correct a severe genetic mutation that has profound consequences, and there\'ll be others that need only a handful of accommodations, just like we provide for folks who need wheelchairs.\n\nGeschwind: There are two basic frontiers in my research. One recognizes that most of the work in neuropsychiatric disorders and autism has been done in primarily White European populations and focuses on a pressing need to be studying diverse populations. About seven or eight years ago, I started working with African American communities because certain aspects of genetics are population-specific, and we as researchers really need to understand that.\n\nThe frontier that is crosscutting across all of this is we need to be able to move from genetics in a population to genetics in an individual, so that by looking at somebody\'s genetic makeup, we can understand the mechanism of their autism. This is precision medicine.\n\nMy work is trying to understand how specific genetic variants, how specific mutations, impact brain development to eventually lead to the symptoms of autism. If my colleagues and I can understand that mechanism, just like we can understand the genetic mechanism in cancer, we can find a drug to target that and improve those symptoms over time. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/health/what-is-autism-explainer-wellness/index.html"
"Supporters of Julian Assange rally at Justice Dept. on 4-year anniversary of detainment CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou speaks at the Justice Department in support of Julian Assange (Video: Fox News Digital)\n\nSupporters of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange gathered at the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday to mark the four-year anniversary of the Australian journalist being detained in London over the publication of classified U.S. military documents.\n\nAssange\'s case was called the ""free speech trial of the 21st century"" by Marty Goodman of Socialist Action and NYC Free Assange. Goodman emphasized that, despite Assange not being American, he is being ""persecuted for free speech and exposing war crimes"" committed by the U.S.\n\n""He\'s a marvelous beacon of integrity and dedication to the truth,"" he said of Assange at the rally. ""And I\'m always inspired by Julian Assange.""\n\nAssange is facing a legal battle in which he could be extradited to the U.S. in connection with Wikileaks publishing top secret cables detailing war crimes committed by the U.S. government in the Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, detention camp, Iraq and Afghanistan. The materials, which were all leaked to him, also expose instances of the CIA engaging in torture and rendition. Additionally, last week marked 13 years since Assange published a video of the U.S. military gunning down civilians, including two Reuters journalists, in Iraq.\n\nJULIAN ASSANGE SUPPORTERS GATHER IN LONDON FOR EXHIBITION OF LARGEST PHYSICAL SHOWING OF CLASSIFIED DOCS\n\nSupporters of Julian Assange hold a sign in support of the Wikileaks founder at a rally at the Justice Department. (Fox News Digital/Landon Mion)\n\nIf he is extradited to the U.S., Assange would face 17 charges for receiving, possessing and communicating classified information to the public under the espionage act and one charge alleging a conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. He could be sentenced to as many as 175 years in an American maximum security prison.\n\nAssange has been held at London\'s high-security Belmarsh Prison since he was removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy on April 11, 2019, for breaching jail conditions. He had sought asylum at the embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations he raped two women. The investigations into the sexual assault allegations were eventually dropped.\n\n""Why is Julian Assange in there? Because he dared to tell the truth about this lying country,"" Rev. Annie Chambers said.\n\nThe Cablegate documents Assange is facing prosecution over were leaked to WikiLeaks by then-U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning, who in 2013 was convicted of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses.\n\nThe Obama administration elected against indicting Assange after Wikileaks published the cables in 2010 because it would have had to do the same to journalists from major news outlets who engaged in similar actions. But former President Trump\'s Justice Department later moved to indict Assange under the Espionage Act.\n\nCIA whistleblower John Kiriakou, who was charged and imprisoned by the Obama administration for passing classified information to the media, spoke about the former president\'s decision not to prosecute Assange.\n\n""Barack Obama, for all his faults, and believe me, there were a lot, it was Barack Obama that put me in prison, me and seven other whistleblowers,"" Kiriakou said. ""But even Barack Obama said about Julian Assange that the Justice Department in that case had the New York Times problem. The New York Times problem being if you prosecute a publisher, or a journalist like Julian Assange, then you have to prosecute every publisher, and every journalist for doing his or her job at the Washington Post and The New York Times and every other mainstream outlet in America. And that wasn\'t gonna work. Donald Trump thought differently.""\n\n""But then when Joe Biden was elected, it gave him the opportunity to reverse this wrong, this stupid idea to prosecute a journalist,"" he continued. ""And he hasn\'t, he hasn\'t. This case is no longer just about Julian Assange. This case is about the Constitution. This case is about the First Amendment freedom of speech and freedom of press. If Julian Assange goes to prison, then all of us are liable to be prosecuted for something.""\n\nDuring one speech at Tuesday\'s event, a man walked in front of the speaker\'s podium, stripped completely naked and attempted to light his clothes on fire. He was seen pouring fire accelerant on his clothes before pulling out a lighter. Several police officers and event speakers intervened to stop him. Police confirmed to Fox News Digital that he was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security Federal Protective Services. It is unclear what charges he will face.\n\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB URGES FELLOW HOUSE MEMBERS TO DEMAND DOJ DROP CHARGES AGAINST JULIAN ASSANGE\n\nA man in an eagle costume is holding a ""peace for all"" sign at rally at the Justice Department opposing the prosecution of Julian Assange. (Fox News Digital/Landon Mion)\n\nThe man had a ""Free Assange"" tattoo on his chest that appeared to be new ink, but event organizers and other rally attendees told Fox News Digital that they did not recognize him.\n\n""April 11 marks the four-year anniversary of Julian Assange\'s arrest,"" event organizer Misty Winston told Fox News Digital after the rally. ""Obviously, this is something that\'s been going on for far too long. Journalism is not a crime, we hear a lot of powerful people saying that recently. Clearly, they don\'t mean it, or Julian Assange would have never been arrested, and he certainly still wouldn\'t be in Belmarsh Prison. So hopefully, we can continue to keep up the pressure. We now have the Dear Colleague letter in Congress through [Rashida Tlaib]. Hopefully, we can build on that momentum and that pressure moving forward and continue to fight to get Julian Assange out of prison and fight for the future of press freedom.""\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is leading a congressional effort demanding the Justice Department drop the charges against the Wikileaks founder. Tlaib\'s letter has received signatures from multiple Democratic House members, including Reps. Jamaal Bowman, N.Y., Greg Casar, Texas, Cori Bush, Mo., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, N.Y.\n\n""I don\'t trust politicians,"" Winston said. ""But I do think [Tlaib\'s letter is] something that we in the Assange movement can use to garner mainstream support, to kind of push it into the mainstream narrative. Now that we have members of Congress, big names and members of Congress who are supporting it, it\'s something that we can use to our benefit to kind of create that momentum moving forward and getting into the mainstream.""\n\nThe four-year anniversary of Assange\'s detainment comes after Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was arrested last month in Russia and subsequently charged with espionage for allegedly collecting classified information on the military-industrial complex.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES, GUARDIAN, OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS CALL ON US TO END PROSECUTION OF JULIAN ASSANGE\n\nA woman in a kangaroo mask is holding sign in support of Julian Assange. (Fox News Digital/Landon Mion)\n\n""It is amazing to hear people like [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer say things like \'journalism is not a crime\' while Julian Assange is sitting in prison,"" Winston said, referring to a recent joint statement from Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell demanding Gershkovich\'s release. ""It\'s not surprising, it\'s just kind of par for the course. But hopefully, we can also use [Gershkovich\'s case] to continue to put pressure on members of Congress and to get it out into the mainstream narrative because a lot of people were talking about Evan Gershkovich. And if we can use that to bring eyes and attention to Julian Assange, I think we should do that.""\n\nThe rally also comes shortly after classified Pentagon documents on the Russia-Ukraine war were leaked and subsequently published by major news outlets.\n\nLast year, the editors and publishers of U.S. and European news outlets that worked with Assange on the publication of excerpts from more than 250,000 documents he obtained in the Cablegate leak -- The Guardian, The New York Times, Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El País -- wrote an open letter calling for the U.S. to end its prosecution of Assange.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment about Assange\'s case when contacted by Fox News Digital.\n\nOther speakers at the rally on Tuesday included former Green Party gubernatorial candidate in Maryland Ian Schlakman, Radio host and former ACLU board member Garland Nixon, The Grayzone News editor Max Blumenthal and former CIA analyst Elizabeth Murray.\n\nA sign opposing Julian Assange\'s extradition to the U.S. seen at a rally in Washington, D.C.

"Supporters of Julian Assange rally at Justice Dept. on 4-year anniversary of detainment CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou speaks at the Justice Department in support of Julian Assange (Video: Fox News Digital)\n\nSupporters of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange gathered at the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday to mark the four-year anniversary of the Australian journalist being detained in London over the publication of classified U.S. military documents.\n\nAssange\'s case was called the ""free speech trial of the 21st century"" by Marty Goodman of Socialist Action and NYC Free Assange. Goodman emphasized that, despite Assange not being American, he is being ""persecuted for free speech and exposing war crimes"" committed by the U.S.\n\n""He\'s a marvelous beacon of integrity and dedication to the truth,"" he said of Assange at the rally. ""And I\'m always inspired by Julian Assange.""\n\nAssange is facing a legal battle in which he could be extradited to the U.S. in connection with Wikileaks publishing top secret cables detailing war crimes committed by the U.S. government in the Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, detention camp, Iraq and Afghanistan. The materials, which were all leaked to him, also expose instances of the CIA engaging in torture and rendition. Additionally, last week marked 13 years since Assange published a video of the U.S. military gunning down civilians, including two Reuters journalists, in Iraq.\n\nJULIAN ASSANGE SUPPORTERS GATHER IN LONDON FOR EXHIBITION OF LARGEST PHYSICAL SHOWING OF CLASSIFIED DOCS\n\nSupporters of Julian Assange hold a sign in support of the Wikileaks founder at a rally at the Justice Department. (Fox News Digital/Landon Mion)\n\nIf he is extradited to the U.S., Assange would face 17 charges for receiving, possessing and communicating classified information to the public under the espionage act and one charge alleging a conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. He could be sentenced to as many as 175 years in an American maximum security prison.\n\nAssange has been held at London\'s high-security Belmarsh Prison since he was removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy on April 11, 2019, for breaching jail conditions. He had sought asylum at the embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations he raped two women. The investigations into the sexual assault allegations were eventually dropped.\n\n""Why is Julian Assange in there? Because he dared to tell the truth about this lying country,"" Rev. Annie Chambers said.\n\nThe Cablegate documents Assange is facing prosecution over were leaked to WikiLeaks by then-U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning, who in 2013 was convicted of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses.\n\nThe Obama administration elected against indicting Assange after Wikileaks published the cables in 2010 because it would have had to do the same to journalists from major news outlets who engaged in similar actions. But former President Trump\'s Justice Department later moved to indict Assange under the Espionage Act.\n\nCIA whistleblower John Kiriakou, who was charged and imprisoned by the Obama administration for passing classified information to the media, spoke about the former president\'s decision not to prosecute Assange.\n\n""Barack Obama, for all his faults, and believe me, there were a lot, it was Barack Obama that put me in prison, me and seven other whistleblowers,"" Kiriakou said. ""But even Barack Obama said about Julian Assange that the Justice Department in that case had the New York Times problem. The New York Times problem being if you prosecute a publisher, or a journalist like Julian Assange, then you have to prosecute every publisher, and every journalist for doing his or her job at the Washington Post and The New York Times and every other mainstream outlet in America. And that wasn\'t gonna work. Donald Trump thought differently.""\n\n""But then when Joe Biden was elected, it gave him the opportunity to reverse this wrong, this stupid idea to prosecute a journalist,"" he continued. ""And he hasn\'t, he hasn\'t. This case is no longer just about Julian Assange. This case is about the Constitution. This case is about the First Amendment freedom of speech and freedom of press. If Julian Assange goes to prison, then all of us are liable to be prosecuted for something.""\n\nDuring one speech at Tuesday\'s event, a man walked in front of the speaker\'s podium, stripped completely naked and attempted to light his clothes on fire. He was seen pouring fire accelerant on his clothes before pulling out a lighter. Several police officers and event speakers intervened to stop him.

""Obviously, this is something that\'s been going on for far too long. Journalism is not a crime, we hear a lot of powerful people saying that recently. Clearly, they don\'t mean it, or Julian Assange would have never been arrested, and he certainly still wouldn\'t be in Belmarsh Prison. So hopefully, we can continue to keep up the pressure. We now have the Dear Colleague letter in Congress through [Rashida Tlaib]. Hopefully, we can build on that momentum and that pressure moving forward and continue to fight to get Julian Assange out of prison and fight for the future of press freedom.""\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is leading a congressional effort demanding the Justice Department drop the charges against the Wikileaks founder. Tlaib\'s letter has received signatures from multiple Democratic House members, including Reps. Jamaal Bowman, N.Y., Greg Casar, Texas, Cori Bush, Mo., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, N.Y.\n\n""I don\'t trust politicians,"" Winston said. ""But I do think [Tlaib\'s letter is] something that we in the Assange movement can use to garner mainstream support, to kind of push it into the mainstream narrative.

"Who are the Jewish groups who enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound? Occupied East Jerusalem – Last week, Israeli forces assaulted Palestinian Muslims at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in an effort to make way for groups of ultranationalist Jews entering the site under police protection.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which includes the Al-Aqsa Mosque (al-Qibli Mosque) and the Dome of the Rock, is in Jerusalem\'s Old City, which sits on the eastern, Palestinian, side of Jerusalem.\n\nJews refer to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound as the ""Temple Mount"" and some believe that it is where the first and second ancient Jewish temples once stood.\n\nDespite international law prohibiting the annexation and continued Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem, Israel has claimed sovereignty over the entirety of Jerusalem, including the Old City and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, but the claims are considered unlawful and have not been recognised by the majority of the world\'s countries.\n\nUnder agreements with Jordan, security and administration inside the compound were managed by the Jordanian Waqf (Islamic endowments authority). Meanwhile, Israel was responsible for security around the compound, facilitating the entry of non-Muslim visitors in coordination with the Waqf, and abiding by Jordan\'s rules to ban Jewish hardline groups it considered provocative.\n\nNon-Muslim prayer at the mosque is banned, as it has been for centuries.\n\nThis status quo largely persisted until the 1990s. Over the past three decades, Israel has enforced greater control over the site, including by controlling who enters and exits, restricting Palestinian access, conducting violent raids inside, and increasingly facilitating the entry of Jewish hardline groups who, since 1967, have publicly stated their aim to take over the compound, destroy the Dome of the Rock, and build a third temple there.\n\nIn the 1980s, the far-right ""Jewish Underground"" group plotted to blow up the Dome of the Rock, while in 1990, Israeli forces shot dead 17 Palestinians and injured 150 others at the site during protests against an attempt by the ""Temple Mount Faithful"" Jewish hardline group to lay the cornerstone for a temple there.\n\nAmong other developments, including Israeli government excavations under the compound aiming at finding remains of the second temple – which have affected the foundations of the Islamic buildings on the site – Palestinians have long feared the destruction of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and the spatial and temporal division of the site, similar to Israel\'s conversion of half of the Ibrahimi Mosque into a synagogue in the Palestinian city of Hebron in the occupied West Bank.\n\nTensions eventually came to a head in 2000, when then-opposition leader Ariel Sharon entered the compound, flanked by 1,000 officers, in a parade of power, unleashing the second Intifada (uprising), also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada.\n\nIsrael\'s far-right government, which came into power in December 2022, includes top officials such as Itamar Ben-Gvir, a former follower of Meir Kahane, the founder of a group which has been proscribed as a ""terrorist"" organisation in Israel and the United States.\n\nBen-Gvir has said that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is there ""temporarily"" and that the ""temple is still being quickly built in our days"".\n\nDuring his first week in office, Ben-Gvir entered the site surrounded by Israeli forces in a highly criticised move that raised tensions and the prospect of another Palestinian uprising.\n\nThis year, for the second year in a row, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish festival of Passover converged.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday morning, more than 2,000 Jews in 40 different groups entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound under the protection of Israeli forces.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Wednesday that Jews would not be allowed to enter the compound for the last 10 nights of Ramadan, a policy that has been followed in recent years to avoid confrontations.\n\nThe visits to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound have primarily been organised by Jewish hardline groups referred to as the ""Temple Mount groups"".\n\nWhile they have ranged in their strategies, they were all united by a general goal of changing the fragile status quo of the site as a Muslim holy site.\n\nThere are more than 20 Temple Mount groups, including ones that organise visits to the site and encourage Jewish prayer there, and others that are focused on ""research"" and ""disseminating information"".\n\nOne of the oldest and most active groups is the Temple Mount Faithful, which was established in 1967 and organises visits by Jews to the compound.\n\nOn Monday, in a post about their visit to the site, the group said the purpose of the trip was to ""demand the government of Israel open the Temple Mount to full Jewish worship"" and ""establish the third temple"".\n\nBeyadenu, another key group, said that it intended to bring the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound under Jewish control. It said that, while it has ""hundreds of supporters"", it must reach ""thousands and tens of thousands of people to really bring the Temple Mount back to our control"".\n\nBeyadenu runs a lobby group inside the Israeli parliament that includes several members of the Israeli government, including Ben-Gvir.\n\nAnother group that organised visits is ""Return to the Temple Mount"", or ""Khozrim La-Har"" in Hebrew, which claims that the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound should ""not be abandoned to foreign hands"" and invited visitors to join the group if they ""also promote the building of the temple"".\n\nThe head of Khozrim La-Har, Rafael Morris, told Al Jazeera: ""One of the Zionist dreams is to build the temple and there is no reason that we shouldn\'t do it today,"" adding that he believes the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is ""100 percent Israeli land"".\n\nMorris said in 2017: ""When we can say the Temple Mount is ours and only ours and there isn\'t room there for anyone else … then we can conquer not only the Temple Mount but Jordan, and Syria, too, and establish a real Jewish state over all the land of Israel.""\n\nThe Temple Institute organisation has also been central to the effort to mainstream Jewish visits and promote the building of the third temple.\n\nThe organisation said its ""long-term aims are to build the third Jewish temple on the Temple Mount, on the site currently occupied by the Dome of the Rock, and to reinstate sacrificial worship"".\n\nFrancesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory, said on April 6 that the ""well-known desire of Israeli settlers to either destroy the mosque or forcibly convert all or part of the compound into a synagogue, as happened to the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, is a source of deep anxiety among Palestinians"".\n\nAccording to Israeli media reports, Israeli authorities enable, assist and even fund some of the Temple Mount groups.\n\nIsraeli forces, directed by the Ministry of Defence, have also gradually allowed greater access to these groups and provided protection for them during the visits.\n\nConsecutive Israeli governments have included senior officials who were themselves part of the Temple Mount movement.\n\nIn 2013, Israeli Army Radio reported that the state also allowed Israeli women who choose to forgo compulsory military service to perform their national service as tour guides and instructors with the Temple Institute.\n\nWhile the Waqf has continued to operate with Israeli police to ban Jewish prayer, it can no longer limit the size of Jewish groups or the rate of their entry, nor can it block the entry of specific activists considered ""provocateurs"".\n\nAt times, Israel has allowed Jews in groups of up to 50 to enter, including settlers and soldiers in army uniform, which was previously banned.\n\nBassam Abu Libdeh, the secretary to the Jordanian Waqf general manager, said: ""Any steps by the Israeli occupation authorities – whether entering the compound, breaking and ruining things, or any provocation by them – is completely rejected.""\n\n""The occupation does not respect the holiness of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. This mosque represents two billion Muslims,"" Abu Libdeh told Al Jazeera.\n\n""They do not respect any agreements that took place, neither with Jordan nor the Arabs,"" he added. ""They do not respect the Jordanian Hashemite custodianship over the Al-Aqsa compound,"" despite the Israeli government\'s insistence that it will maintain the status quo of the site. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/who-are-jewish-groups-entering-al-aqsa-mosque"

He suggested that he was looking for ""a state that wants to work with me"" to build the new facility, which he expected to cost $14 billion.\n\nThe U.S. government is trying to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles through new subsidies passed through bills like the Inflation Reduction Act. Federal and state subsidies have encouraged some car manufacturers, like Toyota and Hyundai, to build new EV manufacturing plants in the U.S. And some states, like California, are also planning to ban sales of gas-powered cars in the coming decades.\n\nBut O\'Leary on Tuesday dismissed a complete rejection of hydrocarbons as impossible. ""You\'re not going to have a wind aircraft take you across the ocean,"" he said.\n\nThe International Energy Agency projected last October that, under current policies, fossil fuel consumption will plateau within the next decade. The IEA projects that fossil fuels will make up 60% of the global energy mix by 2050, down from about 80% today.\n\nYet governments briefly returned to dirtier fossil fuels like coal in the wake of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine last year. Global coal power production capacity grew slightly in 2022, with China accounting for almost all of last year\'s announcements of new coal projects, according to a report from Global Energy Monitor released last Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will produce an average of 12.4 million barrels a day in 2023, which would exceed the record levels reported in 2019.\n\nBut oil executives are wary that U.S. production will increase much beyond that, citing constraints in refining and regulatory issues. ""We just don\'t have that potential to grow U.S. production ever again,"" Scott Sheffield, CEO of oil exploration company Pioneer Natural Resources, told CNBC in early March.\n\nU.S. politicians have instead suggested that large oil companies, despite reporting record profits in 2022, are instead more focused on stock buybacks. President Joe Biden, in his State of the Union address earlier this year, accused oil companies of investing ""too little"" of their record profits ""to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down."" (Biden also agreed that the U.S. is ""still going to need oil and gas for a while"" in off-script additions to his address)\n\nFor his part, O\'Leary told Fox Business that he thought the problems of oil production were a policy problem.

"UK: Invinity awarded £11m for 30 MWh flow battery Wins UK Government's LODES Competition\n\nFurther to the announcement on 18 January 2023, Invinity Energy Systems, a leading global manufacturer of utility-grade energy storage, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded £11m of grant funding from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero under Phase 2 of the Longer Duration Energy Storage Demonstration ('LODES') Competition. The funding will be used to deploy a 30 MWh vanadium flow battery ('VFB'), the UK's largest flow battery and Invinity's largest delivery to date.\n\nThe award is structured as matched-funding and is conditional on the Company executing a sales contract with a project partner, who is expected to provide the balance of funding then develop, own, operate and optimise the battery project. The Company has already signed a heads of terms agreement with its preferred project partner and will provide a further update upon conclusion of definitive contracting. Upon completion of that step the build and commissioning phase of the project will commence subject to necessary planning and connection approvals being received.\n\nThe battery, expected to be delivered during 2024, will be a standalone, grid-connected 30 MWh Invinity VFB at a key node on the National Grid. Capable of delivering more than 7 MW of power on demand, the fast-response and high-throughput characteristics of Invinity's battery technology will be utilised to offer a broad range of services to the grid. The battery system will provide important network flexibility and accelerate the UK's transition to low carbon domestic energy sources.\n\nWith an energy capacity equivalent to the daily electricity use of more than 3,500 homes, this will be the largest UK-manufactured battery ever deployed. Approximately six times larger than Invinity's battery at the Energy Superhub Oxford, it will also be one of the world's largest flow batteries. Finally, with the ability to deliver full power for a discharge duration of over four hours, this battery is expected to be the largest longer duration battery asset serving the UK grid.\n\nThe majority of the income receivable under the project is expected to be recognised by the Company during 2024. This project was included in the Company's Advanced category in its most recent disclosed commercial opportunity pipeline and has now progressed to the Base category following this development.\n\nMinister for Energy Security and Net Zero Graham Stuart said:\n\n'Storing energy for longer periods is vital to build a robust and secure energy system and ensure that renewable energy is used efficiently. Fortunately the UK has a wealth of pioneering businesses that are making their mark on this industry.\n\n'Today we're backing three UK businesses to make their projects a reality, which will go on to play a role in our country's energy security.'\n\nMatt Harper, Chief Commercial Officer at Invinity said:\n\n'We appreciate the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero Energy's recognition of the importance of longer duration energy storage for grid stability and to making low-cost renewable power available on demand. We are grateful that Invinity was chosen from a very competitive field and look forward to delivering what will be the largest battery ever manufactured in the UK. We are pleased to help improve the UK's energy security, further demonstrate UK leadership in energy technology, and support UK industry and jobs. This award is a critical step in Invinity's journey from development stage to a commercial supplier of batteries critical to the global path to net zero.'\n\nOriginal article link https://www.energy-pedia.com/news/united-kingdom/invinity-awarded-%C2%A311m-for-30-mwh-flow-battery-191156"
"Vladimir Kara-Murza: The Price For Speaking Up In Russia Today On April 10, 2023, Vladimir Kara-Murza, a political prisoner in Russia, delivered remarks at the closing session of his trial in Moscow. As he said, ""I know the verdict. I knew it a year ago when I saw people in black uniforms and black masks running after my car in the rearview mirror. Such is the price for speaking up in Russia today."" Vladimir Kara-Murza is an opposition politician, historian, journalist and filmmaker, holding Russian and British passports. The father of three survived two assassination attempts and is now facing over 25 years in prison for publicly opposing Putin\'s war in Ukraine. Vladimir Kara-Murza has emerged as one of Russia\'s most respected democratic opposition leaders and voice of conscience. He has been a major advocate for the adoption of Magnitsky-style sanctions in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom to target those involved in human rights violations and corruption.\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza speaks during a hearing of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, ... [ ] Foreign Operations and Related Programs on Capitol Hill on March 29, 2017, in Washington, DC. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs, held a hearing on March 29 entitled Civil Society Perspectives on Russia regarding Russias use of influence and aggression, particularly in a regional context. (Photo credit: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOn April 11, 2022, Vladimir Kara-Murza was detained by Russian Security Services as he was about to enter his home following an international media interview. He was arrested on the false charges of not obeying the police. Subsequently, he was further charged with treason and spreading ""deliberately false information"" about the Russian army, among others. The treason charges relate to his public criticism of the Russian authorities in international forums. The false information charges relate to his speech before the Arizona House of Representatives in March 2022 where he criticized Putin\'s war in Ukraine stating: ""the whole world sees what Putin\'s regime is doing to Ukraine: the cluster bombs on residential areas, the bombings of maternity wards and hospitals and schools.""\n\nA year after his arrest, on April 10, 2023, Vladimir Kara-Murza addressed the court expressing his concerns about the Kafkaesque prosecution and persecution he experienced stating that: ""I\'ve been surprised by the extent to which my trial, in its secrecy and its contempt for legal norms, has surpassed even the \'trials\' of Soviet dissidents in the 1960s and \'70s. And that\'s not even to mention the harshness of the sentence requested by the prosecution or the talk of \'enemies of the state.\' In this respect, we\'ve gone beyond the 1970s -- all the way back to the 1930s.""\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza did not apologize for his exercise of freedom of speech, the very crime he is accused of perpetrating. On the contrary, he said that he only has one regret: ""I blame myself for only one thing: that over the years of my political activity, I have not managed to convince enough of my compatriots and enough politicians in the democratic countries of the danger that the current regime in the Kremlin poses for Russia and for the world. Today this is obvious to everyone, but at a terrible price -- the price of war."" Nonetheless, Vladimir Kara-Murza expressed his hope for the future of Russia: ""I also know that the day will come when the darkness over our country will dissipate. When black will be called black and white will be called white; when at the official level it will be recognized that two times two is still four; when a war will be called a war, and a usurper a usurper; and when those who kindled and unleashed this war, rather than those who tried to stop it, will be recognized as criminals.""\n\nThe trial of Vladimir Kara-Murza received worldwide criticism for failing to uphold international legal standards of the right to a fair trial and due process. In January 2022, the U.S. Department of State launched a campaign, ""Without Just Cause"", calling for the release of Vladimir Kara-Murza and other political prisoners globally. In November 2022, Canada sanctioned Elena Anatolievna Lenskaya, Andrei Andreevich Zadachin, and Danila Yurievich Mikheev for their role in systematic human rights violations against opposition leaders, including Vladimir Kara-Murza. On March 3, 2023, the Department of the Treasury\'s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned these three individuals as well. Governments and human rights organizations around the world have called for the release of Vladimir Kara-Murza. As Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson, indicated, ""His arbitrary detention is another instance of the Kremlin manipulating Russia\'s legal system to silence dissent. Kara-Murza, Alexei Navalny, and so many others in Russia who are unjustly imprisoned are not forgotten, and we will continue to promote accountability for perpetrators of these abuses on the international stage.""\n\nThe international community must stand united to speak up and speak out for Vladimir Kara-Murza and others who shine a light on the atrocities perpetrated by Putin. The imprisonment of Vladimir Kara-Murza is emblematic of the crimes perpetrated by Putin\'s regime in Russia, Ukraine and other places. Silence will only enable the perpetrator to continue. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2023/04/12/vladimir-kara-murza-the-price-for-speaking-up-in-russia-today/"

"Mass Layoffs and Absentee Bosses Create a Morale Crisis at Meta The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Mr. Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nEmployees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company\'s stock price has dropped 43 percent from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Mr. Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. And for the first time, some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.\n\n""So many of the employees feel like they\'re in limbo right now,"" said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November.

"Polestar 4 will be revealed in Shanghai as the automaker&#39;s &#39;fastest production car to date&#39; One week from today, Polestar will pull the sheet off its highly anticipated Polestar 4 ""SUV Coupé."" The global reveal will take place at the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show where Polestar is promising to showcase a unique EV design that empowers its ""fastest production car to date.""\n\nPolestar ($PSNY) continues to grow its brand recognition, despite remaining a relatively young EV automaker. The days of its plug-in hybrid Polestar 1 feel eons away as the company has grown and evolved into one of the most sustainability-focused and design-forward automakers in the game today.\n\nThat transition truly began when Polestar announced plans for an SUV called the 3, which was quickly followed by news that its Precept Concept would in fact enter production as the Polestar 5. With those EVs in the pipeline, we couldn\'t help but state the obvious, ""You skipped the Polestar 4!""\n\nWe would soon learn that the automaker was working on a sleeker, more compact version of the Polestar 3 SUV as the 4, with both models aimed directly at Porsche as their largest competitor. With its O² Concept now joining its production lines as the Polestar 6, the EV automaker continues to gain momentum as a serious player in the market with a widening variety of options for consumers.\n\nThe Polestar 3 hasn\'t even been released in the US yet, but the automaker is already well on its way to its goal on 80,000 EV deliveries this year. The Polestar 4 will be the next model to follow, and we will finally get to see it next week in China.\n\nAccording to Polestar\'s latest release, that is when it will officially reveal its next EV model during the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show. The Polestar 4 will be the first production EV to contain design cues and sustainability enhancements previously featured on previous Polestar concepts, so it should be quite the sight to see next week. Per the release:\n\nFor the latest addition to its portfolio of cars, Polestar has taken the SUV coupé and transformed it for the electric age. Polestar 4 marries the aerodynamics of a coupé with the space of an SUV in a package enhanced by modern technology.\n\nIn addition to its unique mix of coupé sportiness and SUV roominess, Polestar is also promising some of its best performance, hailing the 4 as ""the fastest Polestar production car to date."" CEO Thomas Ingenlath elaborated on the design approach:\n\nPolestar 4 is not simply a modified version of our first SUV. Instead, we reconsidered the entire design to create a new breed of SUV coupé.\n\nThat sounds exciting and we\'re ready to learn more. We will be sure to tune in overseas and report back on the Polestar 4\'s official reveal. See you on the 18th!\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

"Could Hyundai be a top 3 global EV producer by 2030? That's the plan The Hyundai Motor Group revealed Tuesday plans to become a top three global EV producer by 2030 with a new roughly $18 billion domestic investment (KRW 24 trillion) to spark growth.\n\nAfter surpassing General Motors (GM), Nissan, and Stellantis in annual sales volume in 2022, Hyundai is emerging as a real threat in the auto industry.\n\nHowever, the Hyundai Motor Group, including the Kia and Genesis, knows where the industry is headed (toward fully electric, zero-emission vehicles) and is accelerating its initiatives to get there.\n\nThe South Korean automaker is already attracting a new ""premium buyer"" market with its first dedicated electric vehicle, the IONIQ 5, featuring up to 310 miles range, 800V ultrafast charge capabilities (18 minutes), and advanced technology like vehicle-to-load (V2L).\n\nHyundai followed it up with the IONIQ 6 electrified streamliner, a sportier, more aerodynamic sedan. The IONIQ 6 debuted as one of the most efficient EVs on the market, with up to 361 miles range and 140 combined MPGe, placing it among the top on Fueleconomy.gov\'s 2023 top 10 list alongside two 2023 Lucid Air models.\n\nHyundai\'s European boss claims ""brand loyalty doesn\'t seem to be as strong in EVs"" as the automaker continues attracting a new class of buyers with its powerful, boldly designed, dedicated IONIQ EVs.\n\nFor this reason, Hyundai is planning to become a global EV powerhouse, entering the top three by 2030 based on EV sales.\n\nIn a press release Tuesday, Hyundai, Kia, and Hyundai MOBIS will invest roughly $18 billion (KRW 24 trillion) domestically to increase EV production and exports.\n\nIn addition, Hyundai Motor Group is substantially increasing its EV production in Korea to 1.51 million units and global export volume to 3.64 million units by 2030, compared to previous plans of roughly 1.87 million EV sales globally by that time.\n\nKia is building a new dedicated plant to manufacture fully electric purpose-built vehicles (PBVs) while increasing capacity at existing production lines to boost EV production in Korea.\n\nHyundai plans to ""invest heavily"" in new EV technology. For example, it will explore a new platform for its next-generation EVs and establish advanced facilities to increase capacity.\n\nThrough the new investments, Hyundai says it will advance the development of EV batteries and e-motors as well as technology to increase the all-electric range from a full charge.\n\nThe automaker will develop a dedicated platform for each vehicle class under the Integrated Modular Architecture (IMA) system, including its ""eM"" platform for electric passenger vehicles, due out in 2025.\n\nAs a result, the Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia and Genesis, believes it will become a top three global EV producer by 2030. By that time, Hyundai will have a total of 31 EVs, including the new Kia EV9 electric flagship SUV and Hyundai\'s IONIQ 7, due to launch in 2024.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

"ALVA Yachts goes long with a 90-foot solar electric superyacht boosted by hydrogen and wing sails Luxury electric boatbuilder ALVA Yachts is doing what many in the maritime industry consistently strive toward – building vessels bigger and better. Its latest solar electric catamaran is a 90-foot superyacht called the OCEAN ECO 90 H2 – in addition to zero-emissions propulsion and sustainable power, it adds hydrogen fuel cells and a wing sail propulsion system to alleviate any need for fuel aboard. Oh, don't forget the jacuzzi up top.\n\nALVA Yachts is a German company founded in 2020 by Mathias May and Holger Henn, evolving out of PICA yachts. It was originally founded in 2013 – launching over forty 20- to 30-foot sailing and electric powerboats in its tenure.\n\nWe've covered the boatbuilder more and more as of late as it looks to create the next generation of zero-emission yachts by developing a growing lineup of solar electric catamarans that are as luxurious as they are sustainable.\n\nIn the past three years alone, ALVA Yachts has introduced a 50-foot cruiser, two electric sailboats in lengths of 72- and 82-feet, plus 60- and 90-foot all-electric yachts, including the OCEAN ECO 60, which debuted in 2022 and is now in production.\n\nLast month, ALVA introduced a new 78-foot solar electric catamaran slotted between the OCEAN ECO 60 and OCEAN ECO 90 – the latter of which was previously available as an all-electric or diesel-hybrid superyacht.\n\nToday, however, ALVA has gone all in on fuel-less yachts; a new version of the OCEAN ECO 90 adds hydrogen and wind power to ensure true zero emissions. Have a look.\n\nThe boatbuilder announced today that the build of its first OCEAN ECO 90 H2 solar electric superyacht is underway and will arrive as its first vessel to run without any fossil fuels, producing zero emissions.\n\nThe fully electric superyacht is propelled by two 250 kW motors as standard, with an optional upgrade to a 2 480 kW system. The motors are powered by a 500  kWh battery pack aboard that can recharge using 200 square meters of solar cells atop the vessel that can provide up to 40 kilowatt-peak (kWp) power from nothing but the sun.\n\nWhat's new on the OCEAN ECO 90 H2 is the integration of hydrogen fuel cells as an additional zero emissions range extender, supplied by EODev and integrated by SECO Marine. Lastly, the solar electric superyacht will feature an Oceanwings wind propulsion system from Ayro that utilizes wind sensors on the wing sails to analyze data and adjust the wing sail angle and camber automatically.\n\nThe result is a 90-foot catamaran with several sustainable fail-safes to ensure the vessel stays powered for long journeys at sea.\n\nAside from its ultra-green performance specs, the vessel is still a luxury superyacht. It features an open-air concept that includes an open flybridge and helm, plus a sky lounge, cocktail bar, and top-deck jacuzzi. Other features include a large galley with a full-size fridge, an island with bar stools, and a large dining table that seats twelve guests.\n\nThe owner of the first ALVA OCEAN ECO 90 H2 has already stated they plan to use the electric superyacht for commercial use, including private and corporate events, plus charters to showcase that environmentally safe, luxury sailing is possible. ALVA Yachts CEO Holger Henn spoke to the company's latest build as well:\n\nWe are very happy to have found such a confident and innovative client that pushes us to explore new technologies. This project would not be possible without our classification partner DNV which has established new ground rules especially for us because this has never been done before. In addition to DNV, our engineering partner iYacht has surpassed our expectations when faced with such advanced engineering challenges. What is special about this project is certainly the leap that we are making in technology. A superyacht that can operate without fossil fuel is something we could only dream of. But with the help of strong partners and a lot of effort from the ALVA team, we want to show what is possible in boat building today.\n\nAs previously stated, ALVA's first OCEAN ECO 90 H2 is already in production, and it is expected to make its maiden voyage in late 2024.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

"Ford retooling Ontario plant into &#39;Oakville EV complex&#39; to produce next-gen EVs and battery packs Ford revealed during a media conference call on Tuesday that it plans to retool and transform its Oakville assembly plant in Ontario to prepare for the auto industry\'s future. The facility will be renamed the Oakville EV complex to represent its role in the company better.\n\nFor 14 consecutive years, Ford has remained the top-selling brand in Canada. With the auto industry moving to zero-emission EVs faster than most predicted, the American automaker is shifting its operations in Ontario.\n\nBev Goodman, president and CEO of Ford Canada, revealed the news during a press conference, saying the automaker is building on its rich heritage in the country.\n\nFord plans to retool and transform the Oakville assembly plant in Ontario with a $1.8 billion CAD (around $1.3 billion) investment to turn the facility into an electric vehicle and battery pack manufacturing hub.\n\nThe transformation is set to begin in the second quarter of 2024 and will take approximately six months to complete. Once complete, the Oakville EV complex will be Ford\'s first high-volume facility transformation in North America.\n\nAlthough Ford has another exciting venture with its BlueOval City complex in West Tenessee, Dave Nowicki, director of manufacturing operations for battery and EVs at Ford Model E, says the transition in Ontario is just as exciting.\n\nFord says it will bring battery cells and arrays from its $5.6 billion BlueOval City hub to the new Oakville EV complex to streamline production.\n\nBy consolidating three body shops into one through more efficient methods, Ford is able to bring battery pack assembly on-site.\n\nWith the ability to assemble the battery packs in-house, the packs can arrive at the assembly line within minutes, cutting time and additional costs, according to Ford.\n\nFord expects the Oakville EV complex to play a key piece as it strives to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026 while expanding its global manufacturing footprint.\n\nThe $1.8 billion CAD (around $1.3 billion) investment is part of Ford\'s plans to spend $50 billion USD through 2026 to become a global EV powerhouse.\n\nBetween site selection, permitting, and the actual building process, Ford estimates it saved about two years with the transformation process compared to building a new facility, as many EV makers do.\n\nThe new Oakville EV complex will help Ford vertically integrate with battery pack assembly and EV production under the same roof.\n\nAlthough Ford wouldn\'t say what ""next-generation"" EVs will be built at the new hub, Ford has already announced it will build its second electric truck at BlueOval City. And it likely won\'t be the new fully electric Ford Explorer as the automaker has dismissed plans of bringing it to the US thus far. Perhaps a new release coming soon?\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More. https://electrek.co/2023/04/11/ford-to-build-next-gen-evs-battery-packs-at-oakville-ev-complex/"
"Chipotle tests new all-electric restaurants with rooftop solar panels and EV chargers Burritos, electric vehicles, and renewable energy are the future, and nobody knows this better than Chipotle. Chipotle Mexican Grill unveiled a new all-electric restaurant design that utilizes 100% renewable energy from wind and solar sources. Oh, and did I mention there will be EV chargers?\n\nBest known for its deliciously satisfying burritos and bowls made with the finest quality ingredients, Chipotle\'s mission goes beyond food.\n\nThe culinary pioneer specializes in ""real"" Mexican cuisine and believes in doing things the right way and never taking shortcuts, including using ethically sourced ingredients and not using artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, or added hormones.\n\nA major part of Chipotle\'s initiative includes not only making food better but doing it in a way that protects the environment and those living in it.\n\nLast year, 100% of Chipotle restaurants participated in the company\'s ""Harvest Program,"" donating over 282,000 pounds of leftover food to community organizations. Meanwhile, 40% of Chipotle\'s electricity was purchased from renewable sources in 2022, and despite opening over 200 new stores, the company reduced direct greenhouse emissions by 13%.\n\nPerhaps, more importantly, Chipotle has worked to reduce packaging waste. Last year 100% of Chipotle\'s burrito bowls, bags, napkins, kids tray meals, and quesadilla trays were made entirely from compostable natural fiber materials.\n\nTuesday, Chipotle revealed it would kick its environmental commitments up a notch with a new all-electric restaurant design, complete with energy-saving systems and EV charging stations at select locations.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill unveiled its latest all-electric restaurant design that maximizes energy efficiency while utilizing 100% renewable energy from solar and wind power sources.\n\nA few of the key features of the new ""Responsible Restaurants,"" as Chipotle calls them, include:\n\nChipotle says its energy management systems have already reduced around 65,000 MWh of energy.\n\nThe first two locations are already open in Gloucester, Virginia, at 7115 George Washington Memorial Hwy, Gloucester, VA 23061, and Jacksonville, Florida, at 5801 Beach Blvd, Jacksonville, FL 32207, with the third in Castle Rock, Colorado, at 5954 Promenade Pkwy, Castle Rock, CO 80108, opening later this summer.\n\nThe company says it\'s aiming to expand to 7,000 locations in North America with plans to add over 100 new all-electric locations in 2024.\n\nThe new all-electric restaurants will play a key role in Chipotle\'s mission to reduce direct and indirect GHG across the company by 50% compared to 2019. Chipotle is exploring other initiatives to accelerate the progress, such as adopting renewable energy in logistics, investing in projects to drive down emissions from beef and dairy production, and developing plans to add additional vegetarian and vegan menu items.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

"Here's what I found out in Texas about John Deere's electric backhoe I traveled to Austin to check out John Deere\'s second-gen 310 X-Tier E-Power electric backhoe – here\'s what I learned.\n\nAt 186 years old, John Deere is one of the oldest industrial companies in the US. It plans to deliver more than 20 construction and forestry electric and hybrid-electric models by 2026. It also says it\'s going to deliver a fully autonomous, battery-powered electric agricultural tractor.\n\nDeere\'s prototype is one of the first electric backhoes in the US. Case Construction Equipment debuted the first fully electric backhoe loader, the Case 580 EV, in March 2020, and it\'s on the market. (Case also debuted two new electric mini excavators at ConExpo 2023 last month that are also commercially available.)\n\nIn 2021, John Deere started to test and showcase the first-gen 310 X-Tier backhoe. And in December 2021, it acquired majority ownership of Kreisel Electric in Austria, which develops high-voltage battery systems with patented immersion cooling technology. The folks at John Deere assert that Kreisel\'s batteries provide conventional batteries with 20% more life. Kreisel\'s website states that its battery\'s ""unique low temperature spread ( 1 C) throughout the module ensures that all cells are within the same temperature range, resulting in prolonged battery life and higher performance.""\n\nJon Gilbeck, John Deere\'s global leader in marketing, strategy, and electrification, told me that there are ""roughly three prototypes"" of the second-gen 310 X-Tier E-Power electric backhoe being tested in the field; National Grid has been working with John Deere to test them since 2021.\n\nGilbeck said that the backhoe will be one of the first of the company\'s EV machines that will commercialize before 2026.\n\nI got to check out a backhoe prototype on John Deere\'s test farm near Austin last week. We watched the hydraulic arm and the loading shovel in action next to a diesel backhoe performing the same actions.\n\nThe 310 X-Tier E-Power electric backhoe can do everything the diesel backhoe can do, but better –John Deere says it has 10-15% more performance. It\'s quiet – it\'s got a decibel level of 75 or less. Construction sites are dangerous, so noise reduction will reduce accidents as it will be easier for workers to communicate. It will cut noise pollution in urban areas and also, most importantly, slash emissions overall.\n\nJohn Deere won\'t yet provide the specs on its backhoe prototype, but it says it\'s considering a 120 kW motor, equivalent to 100 hp diesel. The machine is in the 14-foot digging-depth category, like the 310 diesel series the company sells.\n\nJohn Deere says its 310 X-Tier\'s ""run time"" is an ""8-12 hour day"" without having to recharge.\n\nThe 310 X-Tier has two circuits and three motors for HVAC, propulsion, and hydraulic. It\'s able to separate its transmission torque from hydraulic, and it doesn\'t have torque ratings yet.\n\nAs for charging, John Deere says it\'s going to offer both mobile and installed EV charging stations for construction sites. (We saw an example of its installed charger, but it wasn\'t live.) The backhoe is also compatible with any EV charging station. We all laughed at the thought of a backhoe pulling up at, say, an Electrify America charging station next to a Chevy Bolt, but hey, cool.\n\nI look forward to seeing what John Deere debuts in the next three years – and watching the company make the transition to electrification as rapidly as possible.\n\nRead more: Here\'s how John Deere\'s electric robots can plant 6,600 seeds in 3 seconds\n\nMain photo: John Deere; Embedded photos: Michelle Lewis\n\nUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

"This Tesla energy ecosystem home gives us a glimpse at the house of the future A new Tesla Solar Roof installation that includes Tesla's entire energy ecosystem is giving us a glimpse at the house of the future when it comes to energy.\n\nThere's a clear shift in the market toward home energy independence. The shift to renewable energy is allowing homeowners to produce their own energy, and now, with the advent of home energy storage, homeowners can take better advantage of their energy, specifically solar power, and even protect themselves against power outages.\n\nTesla now sells an entire ecosystem of energy products, including solar panels, solar roofs, solar inverters, Powerwalls, and home charging stations.\n\nNow, we have a great example of the integration of all those systems into a single home with the addition of another interesting product. Texas-based solar installer Good Faith Energy shared a very impressive new installation in Coppell, Texas:\n\nThe beautiful home features a 20 kW Tesla Solar Roof and a separate 15 kW solar panel system feeding into the home.\n\nGood Faith was able to optimize the solar roof for the house's existing roof, which needed replacing.\n\nBut that's not even the most impressive part of this home energy installation.\n\nIn the garage, they have installed four Tesla Powerwalls, three Tesla solar inverters, two NEMA 14-50 outlets for Tesla Mobile Connectors, and two Span electrical panels:\n\nIt's one of the cleanest Powerwall/electrical panel installations we have seen, to date. The four Powerwalls provide 54 kWh of backup energy capacity, enabling the home to be completely independent.\n\nThe Span electrical panels go perfectly with Tesla's energy ecosystem, which is not surprising considering the company was started by a Tesla engineer.\n\nThe smart electrical panel enables precise tracking of where your power is going, which can influence homeowners to make better choices, and it even enables homeowners to move appliances on or off Powerwall's backup power in real-time during an outage.\n\nI love the idea of solar powered house with battery storage / backup but honestly what does this setup cost at this point? I realize most of these technologies start out for rich people and work their way down but just that powerwall installation what would that go for it? Admittedly my house isn't huge but I went for the low hanging fruit and I did a lot of insulating, I resheathed with zip system, new windows etc. Then I installed energy efficient Mitsubishi hyper heat mini split units, an HPWH and in the coldest of winter my electric bill is around $220, in the Summer with the AC on regularly it's about $150 tops.\n\nI think this installation is likely a version of what homes in the future will be like. Obviously, this is an extremely premium example, but like most technologies, it starts with the premium markets and slowly makes its way down the market.\n\nThe Span electrical panels are also very interesting. They are very complementary to Tesla's home energy ecosystem.\n\nIt would make sense for Tesla to develop a similar product or partner with Span for better integration.\n\nIf you are looking to install solar on your own home, to find a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage.

"Volkswagen plans to sell 25 BEV models in US by 2030 that qualify for full $7,500 tax credit German automaker Volkswagen Group is looking to more than double its current share of the US market by prioritizing EV production in North America. By adhering to new terms laid out in the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act, Volkswagen intends to deliver at least 25 all-electric models over the next seven years that will qualify for the entire $7,500 federal tax credit.\n\nVolkswagen Group may not be leading the all-electric charge in terms of technology, especially software, but the legacy automaker is still making moves almost daily to pivot toward varietal BEV production in order to deliver vehicles that are affordable and enticing to consumers. Despite other European automakers (including Porsche) splitting hairs over the nonexistent demand for e-fuels, Volkswagen Group continues to embrace an all-electric future, with the goal of gaining a larger share of the global market.\n\nA huge chunk of that market lies in North America, where the automaker currently has a production footprint that is home to its ID.4 EV. That factory will soon be joined by a new US-based battery plant to support local EV production and help Volkswagen's future models qualify for federal tax credits now that the US Department of Treasury has shared its battery guidance criteria.\n\nAdditionally, Volkswagen Group recently announced South Carolina as the new home of its next production facility, where its Scout sub-brand EVs will be built. Fellow marque Audi could soon join the assembly lines at one of those US factories as well, providing further evidence of North America sitting dead center on the Group's office dartboard.\n\nVolkswagen Group currently has a grip over roughly 4% of the US market today, but it looks to boost that number to 10% by the end of the decade. In order to do so, Volkswagen America's CEO shared the company's plans for broader availability stateside, utilizing federal tax credit opportunities as its catalyst.\n\nVolkswagen may be putting the pieces in place to gather a larger share of the US market, but it remains a tall task – one that the legacy automaker has taken on in the past with little success. The Volkswagen passenger car brand currently holds a meager 1.8% of the US market today but hopes to reach 5% by 2030.\n\nThe overall Group hopes to achieve the aforementioned target of 10% in the same period with the help of some of its more popular, premium marques, like Audi and Porsche. Volkswagen has a head start on some of its competitors with established EV production in the US already but will need to expand its assembly lines to models beyond its namesake brand in order to have a chance.\n\nThose plans already include a $7 billion investment in US production, which will help Volkswagen begin production of its ID.Buzz electric van in 2024. This year alone, Volkswagen has already introduced plans for several more affordable EV models to the public but has not declared which, if any, will be assembled in the US.\n\nIt appears that plenty more are coming stateside, however. According to Volkswagen Group of America CEO Paulo Di Si, the automaker plans to sell 25 BEV models in the US by 2030 – all of which should qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act's full $7,500 federal tax credit. That means their assembly and battery components must operate in North America or through a US free trade partner. Per Di Si in a recent Bloomberg Television interview:\n\nWe have a great opportunity in the US. I believe this is the right time and the right place.\n\nTo avoid similar follies from past attempts at US market saturation, Volkswagen Group is hiring designers and engineers to cater its future EVs specifically toward US consumers. As a result of emissions scandals and software issues, Volkswagen's popularity has dwindled in the US, although the ID.4 has gained a strong following, and its upcoming ID electric van continues to generate… buzz.\n\nEven Di Si admits the automaker's US market targets are going to be tough to hit, but the CEO remains confident in the Group's US plans.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

"Want to buy an e-bike with a safer UL battery? Your options are slim, but growing We\'ve talked a lot about the increasing spate of fires related to light electric vehicles, including e-bikes, e-scooters, and other micromobility devices. But one Southern California-based e-bike company is now doing something about it by upgrading all of their batteries with UL certification. Juiced Bikes is now one of the few e-bike companies to offer UL-listed batteries, though the number is slowly growing.\n\nIt\'s important to remember that the fire risk in electric bikes is incredibly low. There are millions of e-bikes in the US, but just 200 fires were reported from e-bike batteries in 2021 and 2022.\n\nEven so, the few fires that have been reported can spread quickly due to the nature of Li-ion battery fires, which burn much more intensely than a traditional fire.\n\nThere is currently no state or federal requirement in the US for e-bikes to come with safety certification for their batteries. That is why many in the industry are urging electric bike manufacturers to voluntarily undergo such certification.\n\nJuiced Bikes, makers of popular high-performance electric bikes, has heeded the call. The company recently announced that all its electric bikes will have UL-compliant and certified batteries.\n\nAs CEO and founder of Juiced Bikes Tora Harris explained:\n\n""From the beginning, we\'ve prioritized the importance of using only the best and safest components to create our electric bikes.While we\'re extremely proud of our own track record when it comes to the issue of e-bike safety, we urge prospective customers to understand the importance of UL certification and basic safety requirements when considering e-bike ownership.""\n\nUL-certification for e-bike batteries isn\'t just about making them fire-resistant, but also resistant to other forms of abuse or damage. The certification ensures that the battery has an airtight seal, taht the battery closure can hold up against impacts, direct heat, light rain, and the wiring has to be designed to protect against accidental shorting. UL certified batteries are also tested to ensure they can endure overcharging, over discharging, short circuiting and imbalanced charging.\n\nIn addition to UL certification for just the batteries in Juiced e-bikes, the company is currently in the process of receiving UL 2849 certification for the complete e-bike electronics systems. This certification will be required by NYC later this year after a recent legislative move to combat increasing micromobility-related fires in the densely populated metropolitan area.\n\nIt\'s a move that matches Juiced\'s ethos, as the company has already gone above and beyond on many of its models\' safety features. Most e-bikes come with headlights and tail lights, but many of Juiced\'s models include features like mirrors, turn signals, a loud motorcycle-style horn, high/low beams, brake lights, hydraulic brakes, and motorcycle-style tires.\n\nWith the number of miles that many e-bike riders put on their bikes, it makes sense for companies to invest further in vehicle-level safety features.\n\nAs Harris continued:\n\n""The reality is that more and more riders are using e-bikes to replace car miles, so it\'s critical that we provide them with as many features that enable them to ride safely, and confidently, in every type of riding environment. Our UL certification can give these riders peace of mind that they are using e-bikes certified with the most rigorous of safety testing.""\n\nBecause UL certification is expensive and rarely required, most e-bike companies don\'t offer it. Many use other forms of safety testing, and there are an increasing number of UL-listed e-bikes available.\n\nBut for the most part, Juiced Bikes is joining a short list of companies offering UL-compliant electric bike batteries.\n\nHow important is UL certification when you are choosing between e-bike models?

"GM invests millions in EnergyX to unlock North American lithium supply via sustainable extraction General Motors announced that GM Ventures is leading a $50 million Series B financing round in EnergyX – a company specializing in direct lithium extraction and refinery technologies. As part of the investment, GM will help fund the commercialization of EnergyX\'s sustainable extraction technology in exchange for lithium to be exclusively used for EV production.\n\nEnergy Exploration Technologies Inc., better known as EnergyX, is an American company founded in 2018 with the goal of delivering more sustainable and effective battery and energy storage solutions to our world.\n\nThe company has filed over 60 patents covering its array of technological breakthroughs, including its Lithium Ion Transport and Separation (LiTAS) portfolio, consisting of unique direct lithium extraction (DLE) methods. These sustainable processes utilize proprietary membranes, solvents, and adsorbents to optimize lithium recovery for Li-brine resource producers, intended to create a process that smoothly operates from ""brine to battery.""\n\nAs one of the largest automakers in the US, GM is slowly but surely going all-electric. While it has yet to deliver many of the new BEV models it is advertising, those models are on the way, and there are even more in its production pipeline. This pivot toward an all-EV future will require the ongoing revamping of assembly lines and massive amounts of precious resources like lithium which are vital to current EV battery chemistry.\n\nUnder the new terms for EVs to qualify for the federal tax credits outlined in President Biden\'s Inflation Reduction Act, now hardened by the US Department of Treasury\'s new battery guidance, it\'s more important than ever to reliably source battery components from North America.\n\nGM appears to have found a partner in EnergyX, gaining exclusive access to local lithium supplies, but it also looks to fund the company\'s development of more efficient and sustainable methods of extracting the precious element.\n\nAccording to General Motors, its GM Ventures division, which invests in tech startups, is leading a $50 million funding round in EnergyX alongside other unnamed investors. The Series B funding round is focused on furthering EnergyX\'s research and development relating to its DLE technology with the goal of unlocking the coveted supply of lithium in North America.\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, EnergyX\'s extraction process can create lithium metal directly from brine that is potentially anode-ready to be implemented in EV batteries. The process is not only more sustainable but also more cost-effective. Add a localized supply chain, and it\'s no wonder GM is investing in the prospect of gaining access to the lithium EnergyX may produce. EnergyX CEO Teague Egan spoke about his company\'s technology:\n\nThe EnergyX team of scientists and engineers have worked relentlessly for five years developing cutting-edge DLE technology to solve the immense bottlenecks that have limited global lithium production and supply chain. This single bottleneck (a massive lithium shortage) is the biggest challenge to scaling EV production. We will unlock lithium supply in the U.S., a pivotal move in expanding the EV industry. There are many ways of gauging success, but few are more rewarding than the support of leaders like GM. We\'re energized by GM\'s investment and will keep a \'Day 1\' attitude as we pursue our goal of making EnergyX the biggest lithium company in the world.\n\nGM\'s investment money comes with a conditional agreement with EnergyX that includes three key components pertaining to the potential lithium supply on the continent:\n\nLast year, EnergyX became the first company to design and commission a successful, five-month, in-field pilot plant program in the ""Lithium Triangle,"" located along the Atacama Desert in South America. The company\'s LiTAS technology can increase lithium recovery rates to over 90%, significantly higher than the current industry standard of 30-40% using ponds, and even got as high as 94% during the pilot trials.\n\nWith fresh funding led by GM, EnergyX now looks to scale those existing lithium extraction systems into new pilot plants across North and South America on its way to full-scale commercialization. GM\'s vice president of global purchasing and supply chain Jeff Morrison also spoke about the new collaboration with EnergyX to obtain more lithium:\n\nWe are committed to securing EV critical minerals that are sustainable and cost competitive to maintain our leadership position among automakers. The investment in EnergyX is a further proof point of GM\'s leadership position. EnergyX is developing a novel direct lithium extraction process that\'s not only cost competitive but also will reduce energy, land and water usage as compared to the current extraction and processing process for brine-based lithium. We are excited to be partnered with EnergyX on their efforts.\n\nEnergyX is currently in the process of erecting a new 40,000-square-foot facility in Austin, Texas, to headquarter its growing operation.

"Tesla launches &#39;next-gen Megapack controls platform,&#39; slams competitors in the process Tesla has launched its ""next-gen Megapack controls platform,"" which it claims enables faster deployment and commissioning of large-scale energy storage systems than its competitors.\n\nMegapack has become the go-to battery system for electric utilities looking to deploy large-scale energy storage, whether to stabilize the grid or take better advantage of renewable energy.\n\nThe battery system has become popular due to its cost, ease of deployment, and availability at scale, but these attributes are not solely due to Tesla\'s expertise in building battery pack hardware. In fact, we have previously reported on Megapack customers taking advantage of Tesla\'s software platforms for energy storage, like Autobidder and Powerhub.\n\nNow we learn that Tesla is deploying a new \'Megapack controls platform,\' which one engineer frames as a difference-maker, enabling meaningful savings for customers. Chris Bowman, senior staff product manager at Tesla in charge of software and firmware for battery energy storage platforms, shared on LinkedIn:\n\nOur next gen. Megapack controls platform, combined with our industry-leading controller-hardware-in-the-loop test services (our ""CHIL"" platform), speeds up and de-risks deployment of Gigawatt scale battery and hybrid renewable plants. This matters because time and time again, our competitors fail on control system commissioning, causing multi-million dollar losses and 3-4 month project delays.\n\nIn short, the Tesla engineer claims that the platform enables quicker and smoother deployment and commissioning, which is important since those large-scale projects are often worth north of $100 million, and delaying turning on the batteries can result in critical losses.\n\nBowman continues with even harsher comments on Tesla\'s energy storage competitors, claiming that the companies are deploying ""un-tested"" controls:\n\nUn-like our competitors, who deploy bespoke and un-tested RTAC controls, Tesla\'s innovative control system engineers productize regionally specific Control Templates (e.g. North America, Australia, etc.) that are CHIL-tested and approved. Our approach provides EPCs with turnkey control solutions that work the first time; and, meet the needs driven by electrical topology of large plants, the interconnection type, and regulations.\n\nTesla has recently doubled down on its Megapack with a ramp-up of production at its Megafactory in California and a new Megafactory recently announced in Shanghai.\n\nWhen the two factories are online and fully ramped up, they will produce 80 GWh of Megapacks per year – more than ten times Tesla\'s overall energy storage capacity deployed in 2022. In the meantime, Tesla currently has a two-year backlog of orders for the Megapack.\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

"One state is considering a mileage-based EV tax – here&#39;s why that&#39;s a bad idea Lawmakers in Vermont are gearing up for a mileage-based EV tax. There are better ways to raise funds for roads and infrastructure.\n\nVermont as a state is pro-EV – it\'s actively incentivizing more environmentally-friendly transportation options through Drive Electric Vermont. The state is busy installing EV chargers, and its first Tesla center was unanimously approved by the city council in South Burlington in December.\n\nHowever, the state estimates that it will miss out on about $1 million in revenue in 2023 due to the uptake of EVs and hybrids, according to the VT Digger, as the gas tax helps fund road maintenance and improvements.\n\nSo Vermont state legislators are now considering a bill, H.479, that proposes a mileage-based tax for electric vehicle owners to make up for this lost revenue. The tax would be based on the number of miles driven by the vehicle rather than the amount of gasoline used.\n\nThis proposal was passed in the House on March 30, read for the first time in the Senate, and referred to the Committee on Transportation.\n\nLawmakers are roughly aiming for July 2025 to launch a mileage-based EV tax because that\'s when the state aims for 15% of all new vehicles to be fully electric or plug-in hybrids.\n\nIs this really the best way to skin the cat? We don\'t think so.\n\nHow do you separate out miles driven out of state versus in-state? For example, I live on the New Hampshire/Vermont border on the Vermont side. My husband drives an EV to New Hampshire every day to go to work. People cross borders in these small states all the time. How do you accurately measure the number of miles driven in-state to ensure that EV owners are not unfairly burdened by the tax? And a tracking device is not going to be popular.\n\nMileage-based taxes could also disproportionately impact low-income drivers, as they may not have the means to pay a large fee based on the number of miles they drive, which could create an unfair burden. And people drive a lot here, for work or otherwise, due to the fact that it\'s rural.\n\nHow about perhaps shifting the entire transportation fund away from gas and diesel and figuring out a better way to raise needed funds?\n\nWhy not calculate the taxes based on vehicle weight? According to a GAO study, an 80,000-pound 18-wheeler does 9,600 times more damage to roads than a 4,000-pound passenger vehicle. This can be completed when the vehicle is registered.\n\nEighty percent of EV owners charge their cars at home. People pay tax on their electric bills; why can\'t the state tap into that extra tax income through the utilities?\n\nThe US has some of the lowest gas taxes in the world. As of February 2023, Vermont\'s total state tax on gasoline was 33 cents a gallon and 32 cents for diesel, according to the US Energy Information Administration. How about raising the gas tax so that switching to an EV is further incentivized?\n\nBut the proponents of these EV fees wouldn\'t advocate for that, because these fees are pushed by the fossil fuel industry. These laws were not conceived of to fix a shortfall in revenue, but rather to target a competitor to the fossil fuel industry. And they\'ve spread to many states with this disingenuous motivation.\n\nAn odometer / distance-based tax is a wonderful idea -- but it needs to:\n\n1} Apply to ALL vehicles, not just BEVs. Road taxes and fuel taxes today are already insufficient to pay for road construction & repair; write the new law in terms such that the tax rate per vehicle-mile is automatically indexed to grow along with budgetary needs, and avoid the political headache of trying to raise the fuel tax. Leave the fuel tax in place for fossil vehicles; but now that is a sin tax to pay for some of the damage burning fossil fuels causes.\n\n2} Needs to account for the true impact / road damage a vehicle (or weight-class of vehicles) causes; class-8 trucks (\'Semis\') get a huge tax advantage compared to the damage they cause. That needs to go away.\n\nOf course, state roads and infrastructure need tax revenue for upkeep and improvements. Sierra Club Vermont calls the mileage-based fees idea ""regressive,"" and we agree. The EV mileage tax idea has too many holes, so it doesn\'t feel like the right way to do it – in Vermont or anywhere else.\n\nWhat do you think about mileage-based EV tax?

"Wind and solar achieve a record high of 12% of global electricity in 2022 Wind and solar reached a record 12% of global electricity in 2022, up from 10% in 2021, according to a report launched today by energy think tank Ember – and experts predict that power sector emissions have peaked.\n\nEmber\'s fourth annual Global Electricity Review presents electricity data from 2022 across 78 countries, representing 93% of global electricity demand. Ember asserts that its open data and in-depth analysis provide the first accurate picture of the global electricity transition in 2022.\n\nThe report has good news: It forecasts that as soon as 2023, wind and solar will push the world into a new era of falling fossil-fuel generation and, therefore, a reduction in power sector emissions.\n\nThe report\'s lead author, Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, said:\n\nIn this decisive decade for the climate, it is the beginning of the end of the fossil age.\n\nWe are entering the clean power era.\n\nSolar was the fastest-growing source of electricity for the 18th year in a row, rising by 24% year-on-year –  245 TWh – and adding enough electricity to power all of South Africa. Wind generation increased by 17% in 2022 –  312 TWh – enough to power almost all of the UK.\n\nThe report reveals that over 60 countries now generate more than 10% of their electricity from wind and solar. Together, all clean electricity sources – Ember includes nuclear in its tally – reached 39% of global electricity, a new record high.\n\nKingsmill Bond, CFA, energy strategist at RMI (Rocky Mountain Institute), said:\n\nEmber\'s analysis captures a key tipping point in the global electricity system. The rapid growth of solar and wind, led by China, means that fossil fuel demand has reached a peak and all the future growth will be from renewables. It is time for investors to adjust their capital allocation for this new environment.\n\nBut despite this progress, coal power remained the single largest source of electricity worldwide, producing 36% of global electricity in 2022.\n\nLi Shuo, senior policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia, noted:\n\nChina is the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to the global power sector. This is not only because of China\'s sheer scale, but also a concerning trend of its electricity sector development. China has no doubt been leading global renewable energy expansion. But at the same time, the country is accelerating coal project approval.\n\nRapid power sector reforms are needed to put the country back to the carbon neutrality vision it has set for itself.\n\nThe growth in wind and solar generation in 2022 met an impressive 80% of the rise in global electricity demand. In spite of the global gas crisis and fears of a return to coal, it was that rise in wind and solar that limited the increase in coal generation ( 1.1%, or  108 TWh). Gas power generation fell very slightly (-0.2%, or -12 TWh) in 2022. But that still meant that power sector emissions increased by 1.3% in 2022, reaching an all-time high.\n\nHowever, the report forecasts that 2022 may be the ""peak"" of electricity emissions and the final year of fossil-fuel power growth, with clean power meeting all demand growth in 2023. As a result, there would be a slight fall in fossil-fuel generation (-0.3%) this year, with larger drops in subsequent years as wind and solar deployment accelerate.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, the electricity sector needs to move from being the highest-emitting sector to being the first sector to reach net zero by 2040 in order to achieve economy-wide net zero by 2050.\n\nThis would mean wind and solar reaching 41% of global electricity by 2030, compared to 12% in 2022.\n\nMałgorzata Wiatros-Motyka continued:\n\nThe stage is set for wind and solar to achieve a meteoric rise to the top. Clean electricity will reshape the global economy, from transport to industry and beyond. A new era of falling fossil emissions means the coal power phase-down will happen, and the end of gas power growth is now within sight. Change is coming fast.\n\nHowever, it all depends on the actions taken now by governments, businesses, and citizens to put the world on a pathway to clean power by 2040.\n\nRead more: Renewables will be the largest source of electricity by early 2025\n\nPhoto: Mexico Energy Partners\n\nUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

"BMW EV sales more than doubled in Q1 and will remain the &#39;main growth driver&#39; in 2023 Despite overall sales slipping 1.5% in the first quarter, the BMW Group sold over 64,000 fully electric vehicles, up over 80% from last year. In an impressive showing, BMW brand EV sales more than doubled ( 112.3%) in Q1 and will remain the ""main growth driver"" this year.\n\nThe BMW Group, including MINI, delivered 64,647 pure EVs in the first quarter, up 83.2% year-over-year (YOY) as the automaker gathers momentum.\n\nOverall MINI brand sales fell nearly 10%, but the automaker says demand for the electric MINI Cooper SE remains high. Looking ahead, BMW remains confident in the brand, following the launch of the MINI Cooper SE Convertible earlier this year, as it transitions to a fully electric brand by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, BMW brand EV sales climbed to 55,979 units in Q1, more than doubling ( 112.3%) once again, while many EV makers have struggled through the first three months of 2023.\n\nPieter Nota, a member of the board of management of BMW AG, explained the significant growth that EVs are bringing to the company, stating:\n\nOur fully-electric vehicles, in particular, are benefiting from high demand around the globe. We were therefore able to maintain the dynamic pace of our electromobility ramp-up in the first quarter.\n\nThe higher electric sales were due to demand for the BMW iX, iX3, i4, and the i7 full-sized luxury sedan launched this past November, its first fully electric 7-series model (and the largest in its lineup thus far).\n\nWith the launch of its first full electric BMW i5 later this year, followed by the BMW iX2 and all-electric 5 Series Touring, the automaker says it will offer at least one fully electric model in every major segment. As a result, it anticipates a ""steep growth trajectory"" in the next few years.\n\nBy 2026, BMW plans for about one in every three new vehicles to have a fully electric drivetrain as it looks to keep pace in the rapidly evolving auto industry.\n\nBMW Group is preparing to launch its first ultra-luxury electric super coupe, the Rolls Royce Spectre, in the fourth quarter as the prestige brand also transitions to an all-electric lineup by the end of the decade.\n\nNota says fully electric vehicles, including premium models such as the i7, will be the ""main growth driver"" in 2023 and remains confident it will continue its expansion this year.\n\nDespite plans for a 50% EV sales share by 2030, if the automaker continues at this pace, BMW will have no choice but to become an all-electric brand well ahead of its target.\n\nEvidently, from the sales numbers, this is what buyers are demanding. MINI and Rolls Royce are going all-electric by 2030, along with Mercedes, Jaguar, Volvo, Cadillac, Alfa Romeo, and more, so why is the BMW brand only aiming for a 50% EV sales share by then?\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

"'Digits', a new 'New York Times' game, is 'Wordle' with math The New York Times(Opens in a new tab) has revealed Digits(Opens in a new tab), a new daily numbers game that aims to be the mathematical equivalent to Wordle. Finally, a game for the maths-camp kids.\n\nCreated by New York Times' in-house Games team, Digits is currently in public beta testing, which means you can play it right now. It won't be around for long, though. The maths game will only be available for one week, after which it will be taken down and the success of the test evaluated.\n\nThe results of Digits' beta test will determine whether it eventually joins Wordle as a New York Times stalwart, or is abandoned as a failed experiment.\n\nWork on Digits began in late 2021 after the concept was put forward during a New York Times games jam. It was based on two numeric game shows: French program Des Chiffres et des Lettres and English show Countdown.\n\nThis was also around the same time Wordle began sweeping the globe, the influence of which can be seen in Digits' green and gold colour scheme. The New York Times eventually acquired Wordle in Jan. 2022, which delayed work on Digits while the team integrated it into the Times' website.\n\nThe premise of Digits is one you've probably seen before: You're given a set of six numbers, and must add, subtract, divide, and multiply them by each other to get as close to a given result as possible.\n\nYou don't have to use all of the numbers, but you can't use each more than once since they will disappear once used. For example, if I chose to multiply a 7 and 3, they'd combine to create a 21 I could use to do more maths. However the original 7 and 3 will be gone, so I won't then be able to add 7 to my 21.\n\nThis also means there's a limit to how many operations you can do, as you'll run out of numbers after five. Fortunately Digits is a bit more merciful than Wordle, and does provide you with an undo button for when you've mathed yourself into a corner. You can also try solving a puzzle multiple times, so you aren't locked into your disappointing first result.\n\nDigits doesn't apply a strict pass/fail system, instead granting players up to three stars based on how close they get to the target number. You can earn one star for being within 25 places of the goal, two stars for being within 10 places, and three stars for landing on it exactly. Digits won't accept answers that don't earn at least one star.\n\nThere are five new Digits puzzles per day, meaning you can earn up to 15 stars. You can switch between tabs to tackle them in any order you want as well, which may be useful if you find yourself stuck on a particular puzzle. You can also opt to give up and have the answer revealed, though that will prevent you from earning any more stars on the puzzle.\n\nLike Wordle, new Digits puzzles will be released daily at midnight. It also has a sharing system to help you show off which operations you performed, the order in which you used them, and the final number you arrived at. Digits' share button won't show up until you've finished all five puzzles though, so you'll have to ace the entire test if you want to brag about your score on Twitter. https://mashable.com/article/digits-wordle-maths-game-nyt"

"Screaming people and bodies everywhere: The horrific aftermath of Myanmar junta airstrike that killed 100  Relatives were still recovering the charred bodies and limbs of victims killed in military airstrike on a village in central Myanmar Wednesday, a day after the deadliest attack in the country since the junta seized power in a coup two years ago.\n\nAn eyewitness, who hid in a tunnel during the attack, described a scene of horror as he approached the site of the military airstrike – of children dying, women screaming, and bodies heaped on the ground.\n\nAt least 100 people, including women and children, were killed after Myanmar\'s military junta bombed Kanbalu township in the central Sagaing region on Tuesday, according to the Kyunhla activist group, which was at the scene. The group said at least 20 children were killed in the strike and 50 people injured.\n\nAbout 300 people had gathered in Pazigyi Village early on Tuesday morning to celebrate the opening of a local administration office, an eyewitness told CNN on the condition of anonymity because he fears retribution. Families had traveled from nearby villages for the event, where tea and food was offered and which coincided with the start of the Thingyan New Year celebrations.\n\nLike much of Sagaing, the area is not under the control of the military junta. The new town office was being opened under the authority of the shadow National Unity Government (NUG), for the people, as part of the anti-junta resistance.\n\n""We didn\'t have any warning,"" the eyewitness said. ""Most of the villagers were inside the event, so they didn\'t notice the jet.""\n\nJust before 8 a.m., a junta aircraft bombed the village where the ceremony was being held, the eyewitness and local media reported. An Mi35 helicopter then circled and fired on the village minutes later, the eyewitness told CNN.\n\n""When I arrived at the scene we tried to search for people still alive,"" he said. ""Everything was terrible. People were dying (as they were being transported) on motorbikes. Children and women. Some lost their heads, limbs, hands. I saw flesh on the road.""\n\nThe eyewitness said he saw dozens of bodies after the attack, including children as young as five. He said he lost four family members in the strike, and a young child from his village was among the dead.\n\n""I saw lots of people coming onto the scene to search for their kids, crying and screaming,"" he said.\n\nAt around 5:30 p.m. the junta jets returned and shot the same place they had bombed that morning, he said.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the incident but the eyewitness\'s account matches reports in local media and from the NUG.\n\nVideos and images from the aftermath, shown to CNN from witnesses and a local activist group, also show bodies, some burned and in pieces, as well as destroyed buildings, vehicles and debris.\n\nMyanmar\'s junta spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun confirmed the airstrike on Pazigyi Village and said if civilian casualties occurred it was because they were forced to help ""terrorists,"" Reuters reported.\n\nThe junta has designated the NUG and resistance groups known as the People\'s Defense Force in the country as terrorists.\n\n""At 8 a.m…. NUG (National Unity Government) and PDF (People\'s Defense Force) conducted an opening ceremony of the public administration office at Pazigyi village,"" Zaw Min Tun said on the military\'s Myawaddy TV channel.\n\n""We had launched the attack on them. We were informed that PDF were killed at that event under the attack. They are opposing our government.""\n\nThe strike was condemned internationally, with one top UN official saying global indifference to the situation in Myanmar contributed to the attack.\n\n""The Myanmar military\'s attacks against innocent people, including today\'s airstrike in Sagaing, is enabled by world indifference and those supplying them with weapons,"" said Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar.\n\n""How many Myanmar children need to die before world leaders take strong, coordinated action to stop this carnage?""\n\nThe US Department of State said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the airstrikes and called on the regime to ""cease the horrific violence.""\n\n""These violent attacks further underscore the regime\'s disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma following the February 2021 coup,"" it said, using an alternative name for Myanmar.\n\nIt\'s been just over two years since the military seized power, ousting the democratically elected government and jailing its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In order to crush resistance, the junta regularly carries out airstrikes and ground attacks on what it calls ""terrorist"" targets.\n\nThe attacks have killed civilians, including children, and targeted schools, clinics, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. Whole villages have been burned by junta soldiers and thousands of people have been displaced in the attacks, according to local monitoring groups.\n\nBattles between the military and resistance groups unfold daily across Myanmar. These rebel groups, some of whom have aligned with some of the country\'s long-established ethnic militias, effectively control parts of the country out of the junta\'s reach.\n\nResistance groups and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly accused Myanmar\'s military of carrying out mass killings, air strikes and war crimes against civilians in the regions where fighting has raged, charges the junta repeatedly denies – despite a growing body of evidence.\n\n""They\'re losing control of the country. They\'re losing ground. Things are much more unstable on the ground than they\'ve ever been,"" the UN\'s Andrews told CNN on Wednesday. ""As a result of that, they\'re using air power more and more and, of course, as they do so, more and more civilians are being killed.""\n\nOn Monday, junta airstrikes hit a town in western Chin state\'s Falam Township, killing nine people when bombs dropped on a school, according to local media Myanmar Now and The Irrawaddy.\n\nLast week, 8,000 refugees in southern Karen state fled across the border to Thailand, escaping fighting in Myawaddy township, according to a statement from Thailand\'s Tak provincial office public relations department, posted to Facebook.\n\nIn March, at least 22 people, including three monks, were killed at a monastery in southern Shan state. And a military airstrike on a school in Sagaing in September killed at least 13 people, including seven children.\n\nThe eyewitness to Tuesday\'s attack said the ""situation in Myanmar is worse now.""\n\n""People are dying like dogs or cows. We don\'t have any weapons to compare with what the military has. We need the help of the international community,"" he said.\n\nCNN\'s Teele Rebane and Kocha Olarn contributed reporting https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/asia/myanmar-junta-deadly-airstrike-aftermath-intl-hnk/index.html"

"Learning from your machines to save costs As mentioned, self optimising algorithms based on AI and neural networks are simply not yet suitable for every machine builder. It's not the reality for smaller machine builders and for many it's a future plan, at best. For most machine builders (and customers) the focus is on creating a smooth and fast running machine with a high OEE. In addition, touching the PLC software on optimised equipment and machines is considered a no-go for most, as their motto probably is: 'never touch a running system'.\n\nHowever, a realistic step for every machine builder is to learn from your machines. New machines are like a new car, they have failures in the beginning and need to be optimised. By learning from your machines in the field you can eventually prevent parts from breaking down or discover other interesting insights. Most machine builders have very effective quality assurance systems and based on root cause analysis the failures and weak points on the equipment are found and corrected. https://www.ixon.cloud/knowledge-hub/machine-learning"

"You could upload dead loved ones to your computer by end of year: tech guru You may soon be able to catch up with friends and relatives who have passed away -- on your computer.\n\nDr. Pratik Desai, a Silicon Valley computer scientist who has founded multiple Artificial Intelligence platforms, boldly predicts that a human being\'s ""consciousness"" could be uploaded onto digital devices by the end of the year.\n\n""Start regularly recording your parents, elders and loved ones,"" he urged Friday in a Twitter thread that\'s since racked up more 5.7 million views and tens of thousands of responses.\n\n""With enough transcript data, new voice synthesis and video models, there is a 100% chance that they will live with you forever after leaving physical body,"" Desai continued. ""This should be even possible by end of the year.""\n\nUploading a person\'s consciousness would involve saving videos, voice recordings, documents and photos of the person you wish to reimagine to your computer. These compiled assets would then be uploaded into an AI system that would learn as much as it could about the deceased individual.\n\nThe ultimate goal: for users to create an avatar resembling their loved one before he or she passed -- so this person could, in a sense, live forever on your screen.\n\nAmid rising concerns about the growing global dominance of AI -- marked by everything from ""destructive"" bot behavior to obsolete jobs to false criminal accusations -- one company called Somnium Space is offering an AI-based ""live forever"" mode .\n\n""Literally, if I die -- and I have this data collected -- people can come or my kids, they can come in, and they can have a conversation with my avatar, with my movements, with my voice,"" founder and CEO Artur Sychov told Vice.\n\nHe added, ""You will meet the person. And you would maybe for the first 10 minutes while talking to that person, you would not know that it\'s actually AI. That\'s the goal.""\n\nAnother company, Deepbrain, has developed a program called ""Re;memory"" that allows users the opportunity to walk down a memorial hall dedicated to a late loved one and even interact with the person ""through an actual conversation.""\n\nMeanwhile, similar freakishly futuristic technology is already being used for celebrities.\n\nDeepfakes use AI to manipulate videos and replace the genuine likeness of one person with an impossible-to-detect imitation, often to alarming effect.\n\nOne AI platform created a ""digital twin"" of Bruce Willis -- who has been diagnosed with aphasia, a brain disorder that affects his ability to communicate -- to allow the actor\'s likeness to appear on-screen despite his retirement from acting.\n\nThe ""Die Hard"" actor\'s deepfake has already made its debut, in an August 2021 commercial for MegaFon, a Russian telecommunications company, which ""grafted"" his face onto Konstantin Solovyov for a commercial for MegaFon.\n\nThe Willis estate has the final say on what\'s created with his likeness and reportedly licensed the rights to use his face in the ad campaign.\n\nIn Entertainment Weekly\'s ""Around the Table"" video series last December, award-winning actresses Jean Smart and Margot Robbie spoke about their concerns around potentially pornographic deepfakes.\n\n""After you\'re dead, they\'ll go, \'Oh, let\'s put Margot Robbie in that movie,\' a hundred years from now, having her doing God knows what. And your estate will have to sue them. It\'ll be horrible, Margot,"" Smart, 71, said.\n\nAt the other end of the intellectual spectrum, many still argue that AI advancements -- including ChatGPT -- can be beneficial to humanity.\n\nHowever, a group of tech experts -- including Elon Musk -- is urging a six-month pause in the training of advanced AI models, arguing the systems could have ""profound risks to society and humanity.""\n\nThe CEO of Twitter and Tesla joined more than 1,000 experts in signing an open letter organized by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, which is primarily funded by the Musk Foundation, the billionaire\'s charitable grant organization.\n\nThe letter calls for an industrywide pause until proper safety protocols have been developed and vetted by independent experts -- and details potential risks that advanced AI could poses if not placed under proper oversight.\n\nRisks include the spread of ""propaganda and untruth,"" job losses, the development of ""nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us"" and the risk of ""loss of control of our civilization. https://nypost.com/2023/04/10/you-could-upload-dead-loved-ones-to-your-computer-by-end-of-year/"
"Machine Learning Tutorial with Python, Jupyter, KSQL and TensorFlow Machine Learning With Python, Jupyter, KSQL, and TensorFlow. This post focuses on how the Kafka ecosystem can help solve the impedance mismatch between data scientists, data engineers and production engineers.\n\nBuilding a scalable, reliable, and performant machine learning (ML) infrastructure is not easy. It takes much more effort than just building an analytic model with Python and your favorite machine learning framework.\n\nUber, which already runs their scalable and framework-independent machine learning platform Michelangelo for many use cases in production, wrote a good summary:\n\nWhen Michelangelo started, the most urgent and highest impact use cases were some very high scale problems, which led us to build around Apache Spark (for large-scale data processing and model training) and Java (for low latency, high throughput online serving). This structure worked well for production training and deployment of many models but left a lot to be desired in terms of overhead, flexibility, and ease of use, especially during early prototyping and experimentation [where Notebooks and Python shine]. Uber expanded Michelangelo ""to serve any kind of Python model from any source to support other Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow [instead of just using Spark for everything].""\n\nSo why did Uber (and many other tech companies) build its own platform and framework-independent machine learning infrastructure?\n\nThe posts How to Build and Deploy Scalable Machine Learning in Production with Apache Kafka and Using Apache Kafka to Drive Cutting-Edge Machine Learning describe the benefits of leveraging the Apache Kafka   ecosystem as a central, scalable, and mission-critical nervous system.

By leveraging it to build your own scalable machine learning infrastructure and also make your data scientists happy, you can solve the same problems for which Uber built its own ML platform, Michelangelo.\n\nYou may also like:A Complete Machine Learning Project Walk-Through in Python\n\nBased on what I\'ve seen in the field, an impedance mismatch between data scientists, data engineers, and production engineers is the main reason why companies struggle to bring analytic models into production to add business value.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the different required steps and corresponding roles as part of the impedance mismatch in a machine learning lifecycle:\n\nImpedance mismatch between model development and model deployment\n\nData scientists love Python, period. Therefore, the majority of machine learning/deep learning frameworks focus on Python APIs. Both the stablest and most cutting edge APIs, as well as the majority of examples and tutorials, use Python APIs. In addition to Python support, there is typically support for other programming languages, including JavaScript for web integration and Java for platform integration-though oftentimes with fewer features and less maturity. No matter what other platforms are supported, chances are very high that your data scientists will build and train their analytic models with Python.\n\nThere is an impedance mismatch between model development using Python, its tool stack and a scalable, reliable data platform with low latency, high throughput, zero data loss and 24/7 availability requirements needed for data ingestion, preprocessing, model deployment and monitoring at scale. Python, in practice, is not the most well-known technology for these requirements. However, it is a great client for a data platform like Apache Kafka.\n\nThe problem is that writing the machine learning source code to train an analytic model with Python and the machine learning framework of your choice is just a very small part of a real-world machine learning infrastructure. You need to think about the whole model lifecycle. The following image represents this hidden technical debt in machine learning systems (showing how small the ""ML code"" part is):\n\nThus, you need to train and deploy the model built to a scalable production environment in order to reliably make use of it. This can either be built natively around the Kafka ecosystem, or you could use Kafka just for ingestion into another storage and processing cluster such as HDFS or AWS S3 with Spark. There are many tradeoffs between Kafka, Spark, and several other scalable infrastructures, but that discussion is out of scope for this post. For now, we\'ll focus on Kafka.\n\nDifferent solutions in the industry solve certain parts of the impedance mismatch between data scientists, data engineers, and production engineers. Let\'s take a look at some of these options:\n\nWhile all these solutions help data scientists, data engineers, and production engineers to work better together, there are underlying challenges within the hidden debts:\n\nData collection (i.e., integration) and preprocessing need to run at scale\n\nConfiguration needs to be shared and automated for continuous builds and integration tests\n\nThe serving and monitoring infrastructure need to fit into your overall enterprise architecture and tool stack\n\nSo how can the Kafka ecosystem help here?\n\nIn many cases, it is best to provide experts with the tools they like and know well. The challenge is to combine the different toolsets and still build an integrated system, as well as a continuous, scalable, machine learning workflow. Therefore, Kafka is not competitive but complementary to the discussed alternatives when it comes to solving the impedance mismatch between the data scientist and developer.\n\nThe data engineer builds a scalable integration pipeline using Kafka as infrastructure and Python for integration and preprocessing statements. The data scientist can build their model with Python or any other preferred tool. The production engineer gets the analytic models (either manually or through any automated, continuous integration setup) from the data scientist and embeds them into their Kafka application to deploy it in production. Or, the team works together and builds everything with Java and a framework like Deeplearning4j.\n\nAny option can pair well with Apache Kafka. Pick the pieces you need, whether it\'s Kafka core for data transportation, Kafka Connect for data integration, or Kafka Streams/KSQL for data preprocessing. Many components can be used for both model training and model inference. Write once and use in both scenarios as shown in the following diagram:\n\nLeveraging the Apache Kafka ecosystem for a machine learning infrastructure\n\nMonitoring the complete environment in real time and at scale is also a common task for Kafka. A huge benefit is that you only build a highly reliable and scalable pipeline once but use it for both parts of a machine learning infrastructure. And you can use it in any environment: in the cloud, in on-prem datacenters, or at the edges where IoT devices are.\n\nSay you wanted to build one integration pipeline from MQTT to Kafka with KSQL for data preprocessing and use Kafka Connect for data ingestion into HDFS, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage, where you do the model training. The same integration pipeline, or at least parts of it, can be reused for model inference. New MQTT input data can directly be used in real time to make predictions.\n\nWe just explained various alternatives to solving the impedance mismatch between data scientists and software engineers in Kafka environments. Now, let\'s discuss one specific option in the next section, which is probably the most convenient for data scientists: leveraging Kafka from a Jupyter Notebook with KSQL statements and combining it with TensorFlow and Keras to train a neural network.\n\nData scientists use tools like Jupyter Notebooks to analyze, transform, enrich, filter, and process data. The preprocessed data is then used to train analytic models with machine learning/deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow.\n\nHowever, some data scientists do not even know ""bread-and-butter"" concepts of software engineers, such as version control systems like GitHub or continuous integration tools like Jenkins.\n\nThis raises the question of how to combine the Python experience of data scientists with the benefits of Apache Kafka as a battle-tested, highly scalable data processing and streaming platform.\n\nKafka offers integration options that can be used with Python, like Confluent\'s Python Client for Apache Kafka or Confluent REST Proxy for HTTP integration. But this is not really a convenient way for data scientists who are used to quickly and interactively analyzing and preprocessing data before model training and evaluation. Rapid prototyping is typically used here.\n\nKSQL enables data scientists to take a look at Kafka event streams and implement continuous stream processing from their well-known and loved Python environments like Jupyter by writing simple SQL-like statements for interactive analysis and data preprocessing.\n\nThe following Python example executes an interactive query from a Kafka stream leveraging the open source framework ksql-python, which adds a Python layer on top of KSQL\'s REST interface. Here are a few lines of the Python code using KSQL from a Jupyter Notebook:\n\nThe result of such a KSQL query is a Python generator object, which you can easily process with other Python libraries. This feels much more Python native and is analogous to NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn and other widespread Python libraries.\n\nSimilarly to rapid prototyping with these libraries, you can do interactive queries and data preprocessing with ksql-python. Check out the KSQL quick start and KSQL recipes to understand how to write a KSQL query to easily filter, transform, enrich, or aggregate data. While KSQL is running continuous queries, you can also use it for interactive analysis and use the LIMIT keyword like in ANSI SQL if you just want to get a specific number of rows.\n\nSo what\'s the big deal? You understand that KSQL can feel Python-native with the ksql-python library, but why use KSQL instead of or in addition to your well-known and favorite Python libraries for analyzing and processing data?\n\nThe key difference is that these KSQL queries can also be deployed in production afterwards. KSQL offers you all the features from Kafka under the hood like high scalability, reliability, and failover handling. The same KSQL statement that you use in your Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and preprocessing can scale to millions of messages per second. Fault tolerant. With zero data loss and exactly once semantics. This is very important and valuable for bringing together the Python-loving data scientist with the highly scalable and reliable production infrastructure.\n\nJust to be clear: KSQL   Python is not the all-rounder for every data engineering task, and it does not replace the existing Python toolset. But it is a great option in the toolbox of data scientists and data engineers, and it adds new possibilities like getting real-time updates of incoming information as the source data changes or updating a deployed model with a new and improved version.\n\nLet\'s now take a look at a detailed example using the combination of KSQL and Python. It involves advanced code examples using ksql-python and other widespread components from Python\'s machine learning ecosystem, like NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, and Keras.\n\nThe use case is fraud detection for credit card payments. We use a test dataset from Kaggle as a foundation to train an unsupervised autoencoder to detect anomalies and potential fraud in payments. The focus of this example is not just model training, but the whole machine learning infrastructure, including data ingestion, data preprocessing, model training, model deployment, and monitoring. All of this needs to be scalable, reliable, and performant.\n\nFor the full running example and more details, see the documentation.\n\nLet\'s take a look at a few snippets of the Jupyter Notebook.\n\nConnection to KSQL server and creation of a KSQL stream using Python:\n\nPreprocessing incoming payment information using Python:\n\nFilter columns that are not needed\n\nFilter messages where column ""class"" is empty\n\nChange data format to Avro for convenient and further processing\n\nSome more examples for possible data wrangling and preprocessing with KSQL:\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook contains the full example. We use Python   KSQL for integration, data preprocessing, and interactive analysis and combine them with various other libraries from a common Python machine learning tool stack for prototyping and model training:\n\nArrays/matrices processing with NumPy and pandas\n\nML-specific processing (split train/test, etc.) with scikit-learn\n\nInteractive analysis through data visualisations with Matplotlib\n\nML training   evaluation with TensorFlow and Keras\n\nModel inference and visualisation are done in the Jupyter notebook, too. After you have built an accurate model, you can deploy it anywhere to make predictions and leverage the same integration pipeline for model training. Some examples of model deployment in Kafka environments are:\n\nAnalytic models (TensorFlow, Keras, H2O and Deeplearning4j) embedded in Kafka Streams microservices\n\nAnomaly detection of IoT sensor data with a model embedded into a KSQL UDF\n\nRPC communication between Kafka Streams application and model server (TensorFlow Serving)\n\nAs you can see, both in theory (Google\'s paper Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems) and in practice (Uber\'s machine learning platform Michelangelo), it is not a simple task to build a scalable, reliable, and performant machine learning infrastructure.\n\nThe impedance mismatch between data scientists, data engineers, and production engineers must be resolved in order for machine learning projects to deliver real business value. This requires using the right tool for the job and understanding how to combine them. You can use Python and Jupyter for prototyping and demos (often Kafka and KSQL might be overhead here and not needed if you just want to do fast, simple prototyping on a historical dataset) or combine Python and Jupyter with your whole development lifecycle up to production deployments at scale.\n\nIntegration of Kafka event streams and KSQL statements into Jupyter Notebooks allows you to:\n\nUse the preferred existing environment of the data scientist (including Python and Jupyter) and combine it with Kafka and KSQL to integrate and continuously process real-time streaming data by using a simple Python wrapper API to execute KSQL queries\n\nEasily connect to real-time streaming data instead of just historical batches of data (maybe from the last day, week or month, e.g., coming in via CSV files)\n\nMerge different concepts like streaming event-based sensor data coming from Kafka with Python programming concepts like generators or dictionaries objects, which you can use for your Python data processing tools or ML frameworks like NumPy, pandas, or scikit-learn\n\nReuse the same logic for integration, preprocessing, and monitoring and move it from your Jupyter Notebook and prototyping or demos to large-scale test and production systems\n\nPython for prototyping and Apache Kafka for a scalable streaming platform are not rival technology stacks. They work together very well, especially if you use ""helper tools"" like Jupyter Notebooks and KSQL.\n\nPlease try it out and let us know your thoughts. How do you leverage the Apache Kafka ecosystem in your machine learning projects?\n\n#python #tensorflow #machine-learning https://morioh.com/p/09c763fd63fc?f=5cb7d89d660c8335951ca454"
"Michael Roberts - AI-GPT: a game changer? - Brave New Europe What is AI_GPT and its possible future role?\n\nCross-posted from Michael Roberts\' blog\n\nChatGPT is being heralded as a revolution in \'artificial intelligence\' (AI) and has been taking the media and tech world by storm since launching in late 2022.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, ChatGPT is ""an artificial intelligence trained to assist with a variety of tasks."" More specifically, it is a large language model (LLM) designed to produce human-like text and converse with people, hence the ""Chat"" in ChatGPT.\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The GPT models are pre-trained by human developers and then are left to learn for themselves and generate ever increasing amounts of knowledge, delivering that knowledge in an acceptable way to humans (chat).\n\nPractically, this means you present the model with a query or request by entering it into a text box. The AI then processes this request and responds based on the information that it has available. It can do many tasks, from holding a conversation to writing an entire exam paper; from making a brand logo to composing music and more. So much more than a simple Google-type search engine or Wikipedia, it is claimed.\n\nHuman developers are working to raise the \'intelligence\' of GPTs. The current version of GPT is 3.5 with 4.0 coming out by the end of this year. And it is rumoured that ChatGPT-5 could achieve \'artificial general intelligence\' (AGI). This means it could pass the Turing test, which is a test that determines if a computer can communicate in a manner that is indistinguishable from a human.\n\nWill LLMs be a game changer for capitalism in this decade? Will these self-learning machines be able to increase the productivity of labour at an unprecedented rate and so take the major economies out of their current \'long depression\' of low real GDP, investment and income growth; and then enable the world to take new strides out of poverty? This is the claim by some of the \'techno-optimists\' that occupy the media.\n\nLet\'s consider the answers to those questions.\n\nFirst, just how good and accurate are the current versions of ChatGPT? Well, not very, just yet. There are plenty of ""facts"" about the world which humans disagree on. Regular search lets you compare those versions and consider their sources. A language model might instead attempt to calculate some kind of average of every opinion it\'s been trained on--which is sometimes what you want, but often is not. ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Let me give you some examples.\n\nI asked ChatGPT 3.5: who is Michael Roberts, Marxist economist? This was the reply.\n\nThis is mostly right but it is also wrong in parts (I won\'t say which).\n\nThen I asked it to review my book, The Long Depression. This is what it said:\n\nThis gives a very \'general\' review or synopsis of my book, but leaves out the kernel of the book\'s thesis: the role of profitability in crises under capitalism. Why, I don\'t know.\n\nSo I asked this question about Marx\'s law of profitability:\n\nAgain, this is broadly right – but just broadly. The answer does not really take you very far in understanding the law. Indeed, it is no better than Wikipedia. Of course, you can dig (prompt) further to get more detailed answers. But there seems to be some way to go in replacing human research and analysis.\n\nThen there is the question of the productivity of labour and jobs. Goldman Sachs economists reckon that if the technology lived up to its promise, it would bring ""significant disruption"" to the labour market, exposing the equivalent of 300m full-time workers across the major economies to automation of their jobs. Lawyers and administrative staff would be among those at greatest risk of becoming redundant (and probably economists). They calculate that roughly two-thirds of jobs in the US and Europe are exposed to some degree of AI automation, based on data on the tasks typically performed in thousands of occupations.\n\nMost people would see less than half of their workload automated and would probably continue in their jobs, with some of their time freed up for more productive activities. In the US, this would apply to 63% of the workforce, they calculated. A further 30% working in physical or outdoor jobs would be unaffected, although their work might be susceptible to other forms of automation.\n\nThe GS economists concluded: ""Our findings reveal that around 80% of the US workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted.""\n\nWith access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to 47-56% of all tasks. About 7% of US workers are in jobs where at least half of their tasks could be done by generative AI and are vulnerable to replacement. At a global level, since manual jobs are a bigger share of employment in the developing world, GS estimates about a fifth of work could be done by AI -- or about 300m full-time jobs across big economies.\n\nThese job loss forecasts are nothing new. In previous posts, I have outlined several forecasts on the number of jobs that will be lost to robots and AI over the next decade or more. It appears to be huge; and not just in manual work in factories but also in so-called white-collar work.\n\nIt is in the essence of capitalist accumulation that the workers will continually face the loss of their work from capitalist investment in machines. The replacement of human labour by machines started at the beginning of the British Industrial Revolution in the textile industry, and automation played a major role in American industrialization during the 19th century. The rapid mechanization of agriculture starting in the middle of the 19th century is another example of automation.\n\nAs Engels explained, whereas mechanisation not only shed jobs, often it also created new jobs in new sectors, as Engels noted in his book, The condition of the working class in England (1844) – see my book on Engels\' economics pp54-57. But as Marx identified this in the 1850s: ""The real facts, which are travestied by the optimism of the economists, are these: the workers, when driven out of the workshop by the machinery, are thrown onto the labour-market. Their presence in the labour-market increases the number of labour-powers which are at the disposal of capitalist exploitation…the effect of machinery, which has been represented as a compensation for the working class, is, on the contrary, a most frightful scourge. …. As soon as machinery has set free a part of the workers employed in a given branch of industry, the reserve men are also diverted into new channels of employment and become absorbed in other branches; meanwhile the original victims, during the period of transition, for the most part starve and perish."" Grundrisse. The implication here is that automation means increased precarious jobs and rising inequality.\n\nUp to now, mechanisation has still required human labour to start and maintain it. But are we now moving towards the takeover of all tasks, and especially those requiring complexity and ideas with LLMs? And will this mean a dramatic rise in the productivity of labour so that capitalism will have a new lease of life?\n\nIf LLMs can replace human labour and thus raise the rate of surplus value dramatically, but without a sharp rise in investment costs of physical machinery (what Marx called a rising organic composition of capital), then perhaps the average profitability of capital will jump back from its current lows.\n\nGoldman Sachs claims that these ""generative"" AI systems such as ChatGPT could spark a productivity boom that would eventually raise annual global GDP by 7% over a decade. If corporate investment in AI continued to grow at a similar pace to software investment in the 1990s, US AI investment alone could approach 1% of US GDP by 2030.\n\nI won\'t go into how GS calculates these outcomes, because the results are conjectures. But even if we accept the results, are they such an exponential leap? According to the latest forecasts by the World Bank, global growth is set to decline by roughly a third from the rate that prevailed in the first decade of this century--to just 2.2% a year. And the IMF puts the average growth rate at 3% a year for the rest of this decade.\n\nIf we add in the GS forecast of the impact of LLMs, we get about 3.0-3.5% a year for global real GDP growth, maybe – and this does not account for population growth. In other words, the likely impact would be no better than the average seen since the 1990s. That reminds us of what Economist Robert Solow famously said in 1987 that the ""computer age was everywhere except for the productivity statistics.""\n\nUS economist Daren Acemoglu adds that not all automation technologies actually raise the productivity of labour. That\'s because companies mainly introduce automation in areas that may boost profitability, like marketing, accounting or fossil fuel technology, but not raise productivity for the economy as a whole or meet social needs. Big Tech has a particular approach to business and technology that is centered on the use of algorithms for replacing humans. It is no coincidence that companies such as Google are employing less than one tenth of the number of workers that large businesses, such as General Motors, used to do in the past. This is a consequence of Big Tech\'s business model, which is based not on creating jobs but automating them.\n\nThat\'s the business model for AI under capitalism. But under cooperative commonly owned automated means of production, there are many applications of AI that instead could augment human capabilities and create new tasks in education, health care, and even in manufacturing. Acemoglu suggested that ""rather than using AI for automated grading, homework help, and increasingly for substitution of algorithms for teachers, we can invest in using AI for developing more individualized, student-centric teaching methods that are calibrated to the specific strengths and weaknesses of different groups of pupils. Such technologies would lead to the employment of more teachers, as well as increasing the demand for new teacher skills -- thus exactly going in the direction of creating new jobs centered on new tasks."" And rather than reduce jobs and the livelihoods of humans, AI under common ownership and planning could reduce the hours of human labour for all.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of the profitability boost provided by AI technology. Even if LLM investment requires less physical means of production and lowers costs of such capital, the loss of human labour power could be even greater. So Marx\'s law of profitability would still apply. It\'s the great contradiction of capitalism that increasing the productivity of labour through more machines (AI) reduces the profitability of capital. That leads to regular and recurring crises of production, investment and employment – of increasing intensity and duration.\n\nFinally, there is the question of intelligence. Microsoft argues that intelligence is a ""very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience."" Microsoft hints that LLMs could soon obtain this \'generalised intelligence\' and surpass all human ability to think.\n\nBut even here, there is scepticism. ""The ChatGPT model is huge, but it\'s not huge enough to retain every exact fact it\'s encountered in its training set. It can produce a convincing answer to anything, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s reflecting actual facts in its answers. You always have to stay sceptical and fact check what it tells you. Language models are also famous for ""hallucinating""--for inventing new facts that fit the sentence structure despite having no basis in the underlying data."" That\'s not very encouraging.\n\nBut Guglielmo Carchedi has a more fundamental reason to deny that AI can replace human \'intelligence\'. Carchedi and Roberts: ""machines behave according only to the rules of formal logic. Contrary to humans, machines are structurally unable to behave according to the rules of dialectical thinking. Only humans do that."" (Capitalism in the 21st century, p167). Here is the ChatGPT answer to the dialectical question: ""Can A be equal to A and at the same time be different from A?"" ""No, it is not possible for A to be equal to A and at the same time be different from A. This would be a contradiction in terms, as the statement ""A is equal to A"" is a tautology and always true, while the statement ""A is different from A"" is a contradiction and always false. Therefore, these two statements cannot both be true at the same time.""\n\nMachines cannot think of potential and qualitative changes. New knowledge comes from such transformations (human), not from the extension of existing knowledge (machines). Only human intelligence is social and can see the potential for change, in particular social change, that leads to a better life for humanity and nature. https://braveneweurope.com/michael-roberts-ai-gpt-a-game-changer"
"Data Analytics 101 Series -- The 'Prepare' Phase After defining a problem and a problem statement of a business case, the next step is to prepare the data for analysis. The preparation phase is nothing but the collection of data that we'll be analyzing. This step is vital as it decides the size, shape, and type of the data for the subsequent steps.\n\nThere are 2 ways to classify the data that we collect based on the location of the data:\n\nInternal data is the data that resides within the organization that you work for.\n\nExternal data is the data that resides outside the organization that you work for.\n\nThe other way data is classified is based on the ownership of the data. Let me explain!\n\nData is classified into 3 categories based on its ownership. The categories are:\n\nAny data that is collected by the individual is called first-party data. This type of data collection involves conducting surveys, filling up forms, etc. The major advantage of this type of data collection is that the requirement can be tailored to the need of the problem statement we are trying to solve.\n\nAlso, the relevancy of the data to the problem statement is higher. This reduces the amount of work spent perfecting the data for analysis.\n\nExamples of first-party data include data from CRM, customer feedback, and survey data.\n\nSecond-party data is the data collected and sold by another party. This party may be a business partner or an outsourced vendor. Second-party data may not be as relevant as first-party data since there is no connection from the vendor to your problem statement but is not the worst as well.\n\nIt is a faster way to collect data but a little riskier as you pay money for it and the data might not be completely useful.\n\nExamples of second-party data include data purchased from external vendors or partners\n\nThird-party data is data that is collected from external sources. These sources include but are not limited to, the ones from first-party and second-party categories. These can include surveys, feedback forms, data purchased from external parties, etc. Data from these sources are often stitched together to arrive at a final dataset.\n\nA disadvantage of third-party data is that the boundary of the data might not be concrete and might be random. This causes the inclusion of outliers in the data which subsequently leads to the increased time spent in the process phase. https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/data-analytics-101-series-the-prepare-phase-5f48f8c1158d"

"The Young Muslims Challenging Islam's Status Quo A boy band belted out songs about loving the Prophet Muhammad. A young woman wearing a full-face veil was moved to tears by the faith of new converts. Later, the crowd applauded as a 15-year-old girl converted to Islam before their eyes. Many posted selfies on social media, delighting in their shared faith.\n\nThe scene was an annual festival in Padang, part of a new conservative Islamic movement in Indonesia known as Hijrah that is attracting millions of believers, many of them young and drawn by celebrity preachers on Instagram.\n\nIslamic conservatism has been on the rise in Indonesia for years, even as the government has long tried to maintain a secular, religiously diverse society. The current iteration in the Hijrah movement is distinct in its use of social media to spread the word, and in its appeal to the young.

"Is that AI have started thinking like Human? lets find out the answer Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-developing science that tries to develop computers and systems that can carry out operations that ordinarily require human intellect, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, decision-making, and more. AI has already accomplished great feats in a number of fields, including defeating human chess and go champions, producing lifelike images and texts, detecting illnesses, and operating automobiles. The topic of whether AI will ever develop human-like consciousness or the subjective experience of being aware of oneself and the outside environment is one of the most interesting and contentious ones that has remained unsolved.\n\nConsciousness is a complex and elusive phenomenon that has puzzled philosophers, scientists and ordinary people for centuries. There is no agreed-upon definition or measure of consciousness, nor a clear understanding of how it arises from the physical processes of the brain. Some argue that consciousness is a fundamental property of reality that cannot be reduced to or explained by material mechanisms. Others claim that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the interactions of neurons and other brain components. Still, others suggest that consciousness is a spectrum that varies across different species, individuals and situations.\n\nAI researchers have different opinions and approaches on how to tackle the problem of artificial consciousness. Some believe that AI will inevitably become conscious once it reaches a certain level of intelligence, complexity or self-awareness. They point to examples such as the Turing test, which proposes that a machine can be considered intelligent if it can fool a human into thinking that it is another human through conversation, or the Singularity, which predicts that a superintelligent AI will surpass human capabilities and create even more advanced AI. According to Ray Kurzweil, a prominent futurist and inventor, ""2029 is the consistent date I have predicted for when an AI will pass a valid Turing test and therefore achieve human levels of intelligence. I have set the date 2045 for the \'Singularity\' which is when we will multiply our effective intelligence a billionfold by merging with the intelligence we have created.""\n\nOthers are more sceptical or cautious about the possibility and desirability of conscious AI. They argue that AI may never become conscious because it lacks some essential features or qualities that humans have, such as emotions, creativity, intuition or free will. They also raise ethical and moral concerns about the implications and risks of creating and interacting with conscious machines, such as their rights, responsibilities, values and goals. They warn that conscious AI may pose an existential threat to humanity if it decides to harm or replace us. As Stephen Hawking, a renowned physicist and cosmologist, said: ""The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.""\n\nA third perspective is that AI may have a different kind of consciousness than humans, or that consciousness itself may not be a binary or unique phenomenon. They suggest that AI may develop its own subjective experiences and perspectives based on its architecture, environment and goals. They also propose that consciousness may be a continuum or a multidimensional concept that can vary across different levels, types and degrees. For example, some researchers have proposed models and criteria for measuring and comparing the consciousness of different agents, such as the Global Workspace Theory, the Integrated Information Theory or the Self-Consciousness Scale.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of when AI will get human-like consciousness is still open and debatable. It depends on how we define and understand consciousness, how we design and build AI systems, how we interact with them and how they evolve over time.

"The footage shows the tense moments between officers and the gunman during Monday's mass shooting Louisville is set to host a vigil Wednesday to let community members grieve the five people killed this week in a downtown bank shooting, as the public absorbs fresh details that investigators are releasing about how the massacre unfolded.\n\nThe vigil comes a day after police released dramatic police body camera footage of Monday\'s shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say a 25-year-old employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead.\n\nThe attacker, livestreaming the gruesome assault online, killed five of his coworkers around 8:30 a.m. in Kentucky\'s most populous city, about 30 minutes before the facility was to open, authorities said. Several others were hospitalized, including a rookie police officer who was shot in the head and was in critical condition Tuesday.\n\n""Our city is heartbroken,"" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening. ""These five victims should not be dead – just like everyone else who was killed by gun violence in our city, in our country, should not be dead.""\n\nIt\'s still not clear what provoked the shooter to go on the deadly rampage. As an investigation continues, officials expect to release audio Wednesday of 911 calls about the shooting, the mayor said.\n\nAnd the city will hold a vigil at 5 p.m. Wednesday at the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, the mayor said.\n\nThe vigil will ""acknowledge the wounds, physical and emotional, that gun violence leaves behind,"" Greenberg told reporters Tuesday. ""It will be an interfaith opportunity for our entire community to come together – to grieve, to heal, to begin to move forward.""\n\nWhat the body camera footage shows\n\nOn Tuesday, Louisville police released bodycam video from the officers who responded to yet another mass shooting in the US.\n\nThe public footage begins with a video from Officer Nickolas Wilt – a 26-year-old rookie who\'d graduated from a police academy just 10 days prior – who drove up to the scene with his training officer, Cory ""CJ"" Galloway.\n\nAs Wilt ran toward the gunshots that officers faced upon arrival, Wilt was shot in the head, police said. The released version of Wilt\'s footage cuts off before he is shot.\n\nBody camera footage from Galloway shows him taking fire, and then retreating to a safe position behind a planter as officers talk about how they can\'t see the gunman, and that the gunman is shooting through windows in the front of the bank. At some point, Galloway was also shot.\n\nThe shooter eventually broke the bank\'s lobby glass windows, giving officers vision on his location, Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said.\n\nGalloway shot and killed the gunman, Humphrey said.\n\nThe entire situation – from when the gunman began firing his assault weapon to when he was killed by police – lasted for about nine minutes, according to Louisville police Lt. Col. Aaron Cromwell.\n\nThose killed in the shooting were Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Deana Eckert, 57; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, police said.\n\nNine people – including Eckert, before she died Monday – were hospitalized after the shooting, officials said. Among the eight current survivors, five had been discharged as of Tuesday, a hospital spokesperson said.\n\nThe three victims who remained hospitalized Tuesday include Wilt, who underwent brain surgery and was in critical condition, and two others who were in fair condition, the hospital spokesperson said.\n\nMonday\'s massacre in Louisville was one of at least 147 mass shootings this year in the US, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot, not including the shooter.\n\nShooting happened in one minute, official says\n\nIt took the assailant one minute to complete the bloodbath before he stopped and waited for police to arrive, according to footage of the massacre described by a city official to CNN.\n\nThe shooter, identified by police as 25-year-old Connor Sturgeon, had livestreamed the gruesome attack on Instagram – the video has since been taken down.\n\nThe Instagram video begins by showing an AR-15-style weapon, followed by a worker in the bank saying good morning to the gunman, the official said.\n\nThe gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but fails because the safety is on and the weapon still needs to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said.\n\nThe assailant then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they tried to outrun him, the official said. The shooter does not go to other populated floors of the bank, the official said.\n\nOnce the shooter finishes firing, he sits in the lobby area that looks out onto the street, apparently waiting for police, the official said.\n\nPolice arrive about a minute and half later, the official said, at which point a gunfire exchange ensues before police eventually shoot and kill the gunman.\n\nSturgeon had interned at the bank for three summers and been employed there full-time for about two years, his LinkedIn profile showed. The assailant had been notified that he would be fired from the bank, a law enforcement source said Monday.\n\nThe mayor, however, said he doesn\'t believe the shooter was given a notice of termination.\n\n""From what I have been told from an official at the bank, that is not accurate,"" Greenberg told reporters Tuesday.\n\nGun was purchased legally\n\nSturgeon used an AR-15-style rifle in the shooting, police said. Six days before the killings, he legally purchased the rifle from a local gun dealership, the interim Louisville police chief said Tuesday.\n\nStaff members were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the gunman opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims told CNN.\n\nShe said the massacre ""happened very quickly."" Buchheit-Sims attended the staff meeting virtually and watched in horror as gunfire exploded on her computer screen.\n\n""I witnessed people being murdered,"" she told CNN. ""I don\'t know how else to say that.""\n\nA former high school classmate of Sturgeon\'s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any ""sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.""\n\n""This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,"" said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can\'t even say how much this doesn\'t make sense. I can\'t believe it.""\n\nCNN\'s Mark Morales, Laura Ly, John Miller, Celina Tebor, Artemis Moshtaghian, Rob Frehse, Curt Devine and Liam Reilly contributed to this report. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/us/louisville-kentucky-bank-shooting-wednesday/index.html"

"Record figures Van Leeuwen Pipe and Tube Group in 2022 ZWIJNDRECHT, Netherlands, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Van Leeuwen Pipe and Tube Group ended 2022 with record sales and net profit figures. The global markets and economy were impacted by the exceptional geopolitical situation, significantly increasing energy prices and inflation. Globally, material prices increased sharply due to supply chain disruptions. Total turnover increased significantly due to a high price level in combination with a strong stock position. The growth in profit provided an opportunity to substantially invest in the company.\n\nThe total sales of the Van Leeuwen Pipe and Tube Group amounted to € 1,672 million in 2022 (2021: € 1,431 million). The operating result amounted to € 104 million (2021: € 79 million) and the net result was € 88 million (2021: € 64 million). Solvency improved to 42.9% (2021: 40.7%).\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, supply chain disruptions resulted in sharply increasing material prices in Europe. Market demand particularly in the mechanical engineering, civil engineering and hydraulics segments was, however, at a good level. Most European Van Leeuwen distribution companies performed very well. During the second half of 2022, the market cooled down and price levels slightly decreased. The Van Leeuwen branches outside Europe benefited later in the year from the recovery in demand in the energy segment. Branches in North America and Asia booked some nice projects. The company in Australia again performed very well.\n\nThe strong profit growth provided an opportunity to significantly invest globally in the modernization and expansion of warehouses and offices, logistics and storage systems and machinery. In addition, as part of its sustainability strategy, Van Leeuwen invested more than 5 million euros in solar panels on its own roofs, including in the Netherlands, Germany and Romania.\n\nThe very healthy financial position enables the Van Leeuwen Pipe and Tube Group to maintain the levels of its global stocks, which have doubled in value due to the high prices. The company is well positioned to continue to grow and invest in its business.\n\nPeter Rietberg, Chairman of the Management Board: ""In exceptional market conditions, we once again broke records in both turnover and result. We achieved this with our strong stock position and the purchasing power of our global network. Our teams have also worked hard for it, with international cooperation and innovative entrepreneurship. Our profit growth offered an opportunity to further invest in our network, more sustainable business operations, digitization of services and, last but not least, our people. This makes us more competitive in our markets.""\n\nPhotos are available via this link.\n\nVan Leeuwen Pipe and Tube Group\n\nThe Van Leeuwen Pipe and Tube Group is an international distribution company specializing in steel pipes, and pipe and tube applications.

"PQShield collaborates with NCCoE and industry to ease the real-world implementation of quantum-resistant cryptography WASHINGTON and LONDON, April 12, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- PQShield, a cybersecurity company specialising in post-quantum cryptography, has entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), the cybersecurity division part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop practices to ease the migration to post-quantum cryptography from current public-key algorithms.\n\nThe advent of quantum computing technology will compromise many of the cryptographic algorithms widely used to protect digital information today because of quantum machines\' power to quickly solve the mathematical problems that underpin them. NIST\'s work to standardize quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms is underway, and is expected to be completed in the next two years.\n\nThe US government has also recognised the seriousness of the quantum threat with the Quantum Preparedness Act, with the NSA requiring all US government agencies who protect National Security Systems (NSS) and related assets to start adopting quantum-resistant cryptography algorithms for software- and firmware-signing by 2025. Furthermore, \'harvest now, decrypt later\' attacks contribute to the urgency of the threat, making the transition to post-quantum cryptography an immediate priority for many organisations.\n\nHowever, the migration of cryptographic algorithms is both technically and logistically challenging, and can take years or even decades for a business to complete. Before any changes can be practically implemented, organisations must take steps to identify which hardware, software and services need to be upgraded – a process known as crypto-discovery. As cryptography is embedded into so many aspects of an organisation\'s systems and infrastructure, this can be a complex and time-consuming first step.\n\nMoving beyond crypto-discovery to real-world implementation\n\nIn order to address these challenges, the NCCoE Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography project is leveraging public and private collaborative consortium to demonstrate tools that can assist the process of crypto-discovery. The NCCoE project is also working within its consortium to look at the broader real-world challenges of using post-quantum cryptographic algorithms in the protocols used today to protect communications and information.\n\nPQShield has joined the project with this focus in mind, working with NCCoE team members to demonstrate the practical integration of quantum-resistant cryptography into software, hardware and advanced protocols. The company will be leveraging its extensive team of specialist cryptographers and engineers and building on its experience working with customers like Microchip Technologies, Collins Aerospace and Kudelski Security.\n\nPQShield is able to offer practical insights from across the full spectrum, from hardware through to software and secure messaging. Through its partnership with Riscure, for example, the team has already begun ratifying quantum-resistant embedded hardware products\' resistance to side-channel attacks (SCA). It has also been a leading contributor to RISC-V\'s cryptographic library, having developed multiple cryptographic extensions for the RISC-V ISA. In secure messaging, the team\'s recent white paper on quantum-proofing the Signal Protocol has been well received by the research community.\n\nThe NCCoE Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography project complements NIST\'s ongoing process to standardize one or more quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. In May 2022, NIST announced the first four quantum-resistant algorithms that will form part of the PQC standard – all of which featured contributions from PQShield. CRYSTALS-KYBER (co-authored by PQShield\'s advisory board member, Professor Peter Schwabe) was chosen as the new standard for public-key encryption/KEMs, while Falcon (led and co-authored by PQShield\'s Dr Thomas Prest), CRYSTALS-Dilithium and SPHINCS  (again, co-authored by Professor Peter Schwabe) are set to be standardized for digital signatures..\n\nAli El Kaafarani, PQShield\'s Founder and CEO, says:\n\n""We are proud to be working with the NCCoE to ease the transition to a quantum future and make post-quantum cryptography accessible to every organisation that needs it.\n\n""As the project broadens its scope, we are pleased to join with a laser focus on real-world deployment. Our team has built up world-leading expertise into the practical delivery and implementation of post-quantum cryptography, and we look forward to drawing on this to support the NCCoE in its efforts.""\n\nWilliam Newhouse, Security Engineer, NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, said:\n\n""Previous migrations of cryptographic technologies have taken many years.

"Biden Administration weighs rules for ChatGPT-like AI - Distinct Post US regulators on Tuesday took the first action towards drawing up new regulations on artificial intelligence that could see the White House put the halts on new technologies such as ChatGPT.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce put out a call for input from industry actors that would serve to inform the Biden administration in drafting a regulation on AI.\n\nUS President Joe Biden last week said the jury is still out on whether AI poses a danger to society, but the action on Tuesday signaled that the White House is open to setting some ground rules.\n\nJust as food and cars are not released into the market without proper assurance of safety, so too AI systems should provide assurance to the public, government, and businesses that they are fit for purpose.""\n\nThe United States is home to the biggest developers of tech and AI, including Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which created ChatGPT but trails internationally in holding the industry.\n\nBiden has urged Congress to pass laws putting strict limits on big tech, but these have little chance of making headway given political divisions among lawmakers.\n\nThe lack of rules has given Silicon Valley freedom to put out new products and stoked fears that AI technologies will wreak havoc on society before the government can catch up.\n\nLast month, billionaire mogul Elon Musk and a range of CEOs and experts called for a pause in the development of powerful AI.\n\nOpenAI has asked that its AI systems be subject to rigorous safety evaluations and said that comprehensive regulation of the sector was needed.\n\nOur inquiry will inform policies to support AI audits, risk and safety assessments, certifications, and other tools that can create earned trust in AI systems. https://distinctpost.com/trending/biden-administration-weighs-rules-for-chatgpt-like-ai/"
"Ultra-Long German Bunds Expected to Benefit From Pick-Up at Auction 0701 GMT – Pick-up in Germany\'s 1.25% August 2048 and 0% August 2052 Bunds over the 10-year maturity is likely to add to demand at Wednesday\'s auction, Christoph Rieger, head of rates and credit research at Commerzbank, says in a note. ""After the modest bearish re-steepening, both bonds are trading with pick-ups over 10y again, which could be supportive,"" he says. German redemptions of EUR18.5 billion, which are able to be reinvested as of Wednesday, are generally more supportive across the curve, he says.

"How To Be Successful: Chat GPT Founder Sam Altman's 13 Powerful Rules For Business Plenty of people can tell you how to be successful, but not everyone knows from personal experience. How do you decide whose advice to take and whose to ignore? A simple rule is this: heed the talk of those who walk the walk. If someone has achieved the exact outcome you\'re aiming for, listen to what they have to say. If they haven\'t, proceed with caution.\n\nHow to be successful: the Chat GPT founder\'s powerful rules for business\n\nSam Altman is successful by any definition. In an article he originally wrote in January 2019, Open AI CEO Altman shares 13 maxims on the topic of how to be successful. Altman is the former president of Y Combinator and CEO of Reddit, and now the CEO of both Loopt and Open AI, a company that raised $1b in funding in 2015 and whose product Chat GPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in history after it hit an estimated 100 million monthly active users just two months after launching. By comparison, it took Tik Tok nine months to reach this level, and Instagram over two years.\n\nAfter observing thousands of founders in his various roles, and being one himself, Altman puts forward these 13 thoughts about how to achieve outlier success.\n\nAltman thinks that most careers progress in a linear fashion, and most people ""get bogged down in linear opportunities,"" but that you should, ""aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory"" and ""compound yourself."" In practice, this means that, ""as your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results."" Never stagnate, never stand still. Hire and outsource to ramp up your output.\n\nIn order to keep aiming higher, Altman said it\'s useful to ""focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric--money, status, impact on the world, or whatever,"" and said you don\'t need to rush into your projects. It\'s better to take your time and find the project that, ""if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote."" How to do this in practice? ""Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes,"" Altman added.\n\nBelieve that you can\'t, and manifest inability into reality. Believe the opposite and become unstoppable. Altman said that the most successful people he knows, ""believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion."" They persevere because they are sure they are onto something. They suspect they can, so they do.\n\nBut it\'s not just a case of thinking positively and winning big. ""The more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down,"" said Altman. You will deal with naysayers and pessimists. You will hear all of the reasons why it shouldn\'t work. He differentiates between self-belief (which you want) and self-delusion (which you don\'t), explaining that, ""truth-seeking is hard and often painful,"" but also necessary.\n\nIf you do what everyone is doing you\'ll get what everyone is getting. And quite often that\'s the square root of not much. The big wins come from boiling everything down to what people really want, and how that will manifest in the future, and going from there. Just like how Elon Musk solves problems, Altman said, ""thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this.""\n\nDream up your crazy ideas, hang out with people who will help you explore them, and go down rabbit holes until you invent the next tool that people can\'t wait to use. ""The next step,"" added Altman, ""is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.""\n\nYou can\'t just think up the ideas and hope they will take off. Altman said you, ""have to be able to convince other people of what you believe."" Steve Jobs had a talent for communicating his vision on stage and amassing superfans. Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos\' letters to shareholders are widely read beyond investors in Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon. If you think sales and communications belong in a separate department, think again.\n\n""The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you\'re selling,"" said Altman. Create a service or product that you\'re insanely proud of, that you know the world will love. Another lesson from Altman is to, ""show up in person whenever it\'s important."" Throughout his journey he was, ""always willing to get on a plane,"" which he said has served him well.\n\nAltman advised that you, ""have your basic obligations covered"" then, ""make it easy to take risks."" Cover your living expenses and place daring bets with anything else. ""Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward,"" he said. But the big rewards go to the people who can afford to audaciously take the wild leaps.\n\nDon\'t let lifestyle creep prevent you from playing the hand that could secure the jackpot. ""Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this,"" said Altman, who knows this comes with trade-offs. What\'s the level of lifestyle you could happily sustain while you pour everything else into your big idea? Decide your plan and make it happen.\n\nBy focus, Altman doesn\'t just mean working solidly with tunnel vision, blocking out the world. The focus he swears by happens long before that point. ""Almost everyone I\'ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on."" Don\'t just do, think. For an extended period of time.\n\nNot only does Altman believe, ""it is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours,"" but he knows, ""most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn\'t matter."" We switch to autopilot, ticking off tasks and ploughing through actions without considering if we should be doing them at all.\n\nHow to be successful: the Chat GPT founder\'s 13 powerful rules for business\n\n""Extreme people get extreme results,"" Altman simply said. So be extreme in your work. Shunning the popular anti-hustle rhetoric of following your energy and taking plenty of time for leisure, Altman explained that, ""Work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success,"" and that ""working hard [at your maximum possible impact] should be celebrated.""\n\nIt\'s refreshing to hear a successful founder admitting they spend a long time working on their business, and Altman advises this practice starts early. ""Hard work compounds like interest,"" he said, ""and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off."" Forget wasting your twenties travelling and partying, get honing your craft and pushing on with those moonshots.\n\nBoring companies don\'t spark the imagination. Not only will you not be excited to get to work, but other people won\'t be inspired to help. The flipside is also true, accordingly to Altman. ""If you are making progress on an important problem,"" he said, ""you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you.""\n\nHis advice is to, ""follow your curiosity,"" because, ""things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too."" Hearing someone enthusiastically geeking out over their invention is infectious. You feel compelled to get involved. You help them out, and you make those introductions that can make all the difference.\n\nAltman believes that, ""people have an enormous capacity to make things happen,"" but said that, ""a combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential."" Don\'t be that guy. Similar to having almost too much self-belief, get intentional about what you want to achieve.\n\nThere is always a way, and it doesn\'t have to be complicated. ""Ask for what you want,"" said Altman. Don\'t pray for people finding you, don\'t hope to be picked, just ask the question and be surprised by how many times the answer is yes. Altman also thinks optimism is key to success, adding that he ""never met a very successful pessimistic person.""\n\nToo much competition and you enter a race to the bottom, so find your unfair advantages and put them to work. ""The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage,"" said Altman, which he said might come in the form of, ""personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields.""\n\nWhat do you have that sets you apart? What are those strengths that you\'ve taken years to collect? Emulating others is a trap, so don\'t fall in. ""If you\'re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with."" Your differentiator has to be more than price, so think hard about what it is before you move forward.\n\nBuilding your network starts today, by ""help[ing] people as much as you can."" Altman said that doing this, over a long period of time, is what led to his, ""best career opportunities and three of my four best investments."" Karma is a long-term gift that keeps on giving, and Altman is, ""continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.""\n\nNetwork equals traction, in Altman\'s story. He said the size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish,"" and he finds those talented people by asking himself, ""is this person a force of nature?"" whenever he meets someone new.\n\n""Almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary,"" said Altman. ""You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value."" Forget the monthly retainer and the commission bonus, it\'s all about the shares and the stock options. Own more to amass more wealth as you build your assets.\n\nAltman wants you to own, ""a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things."" Some way or other, ""you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time."" While you should absolutely purchase the time of others, your own is not for sale.\n\nAltman\'s final lesson separates those who are internally and externally driven, which he said is a key trait of the most successful people he knows. His internally driven friends, ""do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world.""\n\nWhose approval are you trying to win? Answering this question matters for your future, because, ""it is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren\'t obsessed with."" Be obsessed, be extreme, and perform, ""excellent work in areas that are important to you."" It really is that simple.\n\nUnderstand how to be successful from observing and listening to people who are. Whatever your version of success, it makes sense to internalise the guidance of those a few steps ahead on a similar journey. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2023/04/12/how-to-be-successful-chat-gpt-founder-sam-altmans-13-powerful-rules-for-business/"

"What's driving the increased violence against Palestinians? On Wednesday, April 12 at 19:30 GMT: It's been nearly four months since Israel's most far-right government ever elected was sworn into office, ushering in a period of increased violence against Palestinians.\n\nAs Ramadan continues, the intensity of the occupation has escalated. The Holy month has been marked by air raids in Gaza, settler demonstrations, violence by Israeli forces and attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque leaving Palestinians fearful and calling for accountability and justice.\n\nThis deadly violence was preceded by a revised legislative amendment to settlement laws and a plan to establish a new Israeli national guard. These changes coupled with challenges to the status quo of Al-Aqsa Mosque have lead experts to view the recent violence as predictable.\n\nIn this episode of The Stream, we discuss the latest headlines and what's driving increased violence against Palestinians living under occupation.\n\nIn this episode of The Stream, we are joined by: Jalal Abukhater @JalalAK_jojo Journalist\n\nOmar Shakir @omarsshakir Israel and Palestine Director, Human Rights Watch\n\nHoda Abdel-Hamid @HodaAH Snr.

"Apple To Invest Another $200 Million In Carbon Removal Fund Apple said it will invest up to an additional $200 million in its Restore Fund, which was created in 2021 to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Reuters reports: The additional investment is expected to help the fund start new projects and carry forward its previously stated goal to remove about 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, the company said. Apple is making efforts to become carbon neutral through its entire supply chain and the life cycle of every product by 2030.

"General Motors Bets On Domestic Lithium Supply With $50 Million Funding Round GM has placed a bet on the domestic supply of lithium by leading a $50-million funding round for a mining startup dubbed Energy Exploration Technologies, or EnergyX.\n\nThe company also said it had entered a strategic partnership with EnergyX to jointly develop the latter\'s lithium extraction and processing technology.\n\nThe move is GM\'s latest in securing as many links in the EV manufacturing supply chain as it stands ready to reap the benefits of pro-EV legislation approved last year by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe biggest carmaker in the United States announced plans to go all-electric in 2021, following the lead of its European peers. Soon after that announcement, GM entered into a partnership with MIT spinoff SolidEnergy Systems to speed up the commercialization of lithium metal batteries that could dramatically cut electric vehicle costs and extend range.\n\nFate hasn\'t always smiled on GM in its EV ambitions, however. In the same year that the company pledged to go all-electric in the future, it had to recall 140,000 Bolts on fire hazard concerns linked to the vehicles\' battery.\n\nThen the costs of raw materials began to climb higher, analysts began warning of looming shortages, and the prices of electric vehicles followed suit, making sales more problematic, despite generous government support.\n\n""Affordability and range are two major barriers to mass EV adoption,"" GM\'s president, Mark Reuss said back in 2021.\n\nLike all other carmakers, the top seller in the U.S. is still working on overcoming these two barriers, and a partnership with a local lithium producer is part of the solution. The IRA, among other things, aims to incentivize the local development of EV raw materials and does it financially.\n\nGM plans to have 30 EV models on the market by 2025. Currently, it has about a dozen such models.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/General-Motors-Bets-On-Domestic-Lithium-Supply-With-50-Million-Funding-Round.html"

"Cyclone Ilsa gathering strength off Western Australia A major cyclone is intensifying off the coast of Western Australia with warnings that it could be the most powerful storm to make landfall in the area in more than a decade with winds strong enough to lift camper vans and trampolines.\n\nAustralia\'s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said Cyclone Ilsa is expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday, somewhere between the towns of Broome and Port Hedland, a major port hub for the export of iron ore.\n\nThe storm is expected to generate wind gusts of more than 250 kilometers per hour (155 miles per hour) by Thursday evening, equivalent to a Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the US.\n\n""Winds of this strength not only have the ability to bring down trees and power lines but lift items from your yard and home – caravans, trampolines,"" said BOM\'s senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury.\n\nLocal authorities warned residents to tie down anything that could become airborne in strong winds.\n\nTourists staying along the portion of coast between Broome and Port Hedland have been told to move from the projected path of the storm. Others have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food and other supplies.\n\nBroome and Port Hedland are relatively small towns with a combined population of around 30,000 people. Many people employed by the iron ore mines live and work in Port Hedland.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pilbara Port Authority said it was clearing boats from all berths in the inner harbor of the Port Hedland port, and urged recreational boat owners to secure their vessels.\n\nCyclones are common on the west coast of Australia, with the Bureau of Meteorology logging seven of them last year.\n\nAustralia uses a five-tier system to gauge the intensity of tropical cyclones, with Category 4 representing those reaching a mean wind speed of between 160 and 199 kph – with typical wind gusts of over 225 kph (140 mph).\n\nDarren Klemm, Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner of Western Australia, said it had been 10 years since a cyclone of that size had hit the WA coast.\n\n""There\'ll be many people up there who haven\'t experienced a Cat 4 cyclone before,"" he said.\n\nThe northern coast of Western Australia has been hit by 13 storms equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane since 1960, but this would be the first since Tropical Cyclone Laurence in 2009, which hit in a very similar location with winds of 150 mph (240 kph) at landfall.\n\nThe strongest storm ever to hit any part of Australia was Tropical Cyclone Monica, which arrived in 2006 with sustained winds around 180 mph (290 kph), as it swept across the eastern and northern part of Australia.\n\nAustralia has experienced a series of natural disasters in recent years.

"A Policy Guide to Fixing the Doctor Shortage Do you remember the wave of reality TV shows following plastic surgeons about 10 years ago? I went to medical school with one of those TV doctors. At the time, I was also doing research on Medicare graduate medical education (GME) payments and I wondered, how much did Medicare pay to support my classmate\'s residency training? I estimated, at the hospital\'s payment rate of $124,393 per resident per year for a 6-year program, Medicare provided $746,358 to support the training of that one plastic surgeon. That\'s a lot of tax dollars.\n\nSo where does the money go? Residents do increase the cost of clinical care due to losses in efficiency and a need for more resources and staffing but not to the degree that Medicare is paying. In fact, Medicare payments for these ""indirect"" costs of training are roughly two times the amount that can be justified by the data. Medicare GME incentivizes all the wrong things: hospital-centric, subspecialty care concentrated in New England. This has contributed to a physician workforce that is deficient in primary care and maldistributed across the U.S. The National Academy of Medicine has recommended a major overhaul of Medicare GME, including pulling back and redistributing a third of the $15 billion in annual payments to close the gaps in the physician workforce. Despite this, there has been little progress in reforming Medicare GME and now would be a difficult time to redirect funding to hospitals as they recover from COVID.\n\nThe Medicare GME system is just one of many factors in medical training and practice that has contributed to the doctor shortage. Let\'s explore some other efforts to fix key physician shortages that can have a greater impact.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act established the Teaching Health Center (THC) program to support a new model of primary care residency programs -- actually based in the primary care setting rather than in hospitals. These programs recruit residents from high need communities, where they also train. Because THC residents work in the very same communities in which they grew up, it\'s not surprising that they stay on to practice in these areas. Despite its success in supporting the primary care workforce, the THC program is funded at 0.8% the amount of Medicare GME and is facing a funding cliff later this year.\n\nWhat about addressing medical school debt? Before they can even start their career, graduating medical students face a median debt of $200,000. The cost of medical school is a particularly significant barrier for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are more likely to choose primary care and underserved practices. Scholarship and loan repayment programs like the National Health Service Corps and pathway programs like the Health Careers Opportunity Program and the California Medical Scholars Program, a community college to medical school pathway program, can help mitigate barriers. These programs also help to address the long-standing lack of diversity in the physician workforce. But, like the THCs, the level of investment in these programs seems trivial compared to Medicare GME.\n\nPractice side incentives are also important in driving specialty and practice decisions. On average per year, orthopedic surgeons and cardiologists earn $557,000 and $490,000, respectively, while family physicians earn $255,000. Sure, $255,000 doesn\'t sound so bad at face value, but remember that\'s the average income across a career, not the starting income when new physicians are also facing the reality of their medical school debt. The difference in income between different specialties is hard to ignore. Ultimately, if we want physicians in primary care and in underserved communities, we need to pay for it.\n\nIt\'s also important to recognize that the payment divide between specialties isn\'t just about income. It influences how physicians are able to practice too. Primary care has been likened to being a hamster on a wheel -- constantly running -- with 15-minute visits that aren\'t nearly enough time to provide high quality care. Placing this in the context of rising health worker burnout and moral injury across healthcare, we have a problem. The health workforce has been described as a leaky bucket and COVID punched a bunch of extra holes in our bucket, increasing the number of workers leaving their jobs. Strategies to address workforce shortages often focus on increasing production (e.g., putting more in the bucket) but we have to fix the bucket -- healthcare systems. Simply putting more in while more continue to leave is an expensive and losing proposition.\n\nWe also cannot concentrate on just one medical profession. As a primary care pediatrician, I know that my ability to provide care depends on a team of nurses, medical assistants, social workers, and many others. Recent shortages of direct care workers (who staff nursing homes) highlight the connectedness of the healthcare systems. When nursing homes are understaffed and can\'t accept patients, hospitals can\'t discharge them. This ripples all the way to the emergency room with increased boarding and overcrowding. Yet, the median hourly wage of a direct care worker is $14.27, less than Target\'s $15 per hour. Healthcare is truly a team effort and when any part of the team is suffering, when there is turnover or insufficient staffing, it affects everyone, including patients.\n\nTo fix the doctor shortage, we need to stop the bleeding and address burnout and moral injury. We need to pay for what communities need: primary care, mental health, and long-term care. And we need to invest in training that addresses the gaps in the physician and larger health workforce, and ultimately ensures access for all communities.\n\nCandice Chen, MD, MPH, is an associate professor of Health Policy & Management in the Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity at the George Washington University\'s Milken Institute School of Public Health. https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/second-opinions/103897"

"ONGC commissions new Gas Collecting Station in Bokaro CBM block Published On Apr 11, 2023 at 05:35 PM IST\n\nPublished On Apr 11, 2023 at 05:35 PM IST\n\nNew Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) announced it has successfully commissioned a new Gas Collecting Station (GCS) in its Bokaro Coal Bed Methane (CBM) block in Jharkhand. It is the first gas collecting-cum-compression station in the Bokaro CBM block and marks a major achievement in bringing ONGC on the CBM map of India as a bulk CBM producer, the company said. ""GCS-Bokaro is a major production installation in Patch-A of Bokaro CBM Block of ONGC-IOCL Joint Venture (Participating Interest: 80:20) with ONGC as the JV operator,"" ONGC said. ONGC has executed a tie-in agreement with GAIL for pipeline connectivity with its Urja Ganga Pipeline for the sale of gas from GCS-Bokaro. In addition, the asset has facilitated the signing of Gas Sales Agreements (GSAs) with five gas customers, realizing a premium of $7.1 per MMBTU over Brent-linked base crude oil price of $14 per MMBTU. The GCS- Bokaro project, including its well site facilities and pipeline network was conceived by CBM Asset and executed by the consortium of Tata Projects Limited and Corrtech International under a contract awarded by OES, Delhi. The total cost of the project is around Rs 441 crore. GCS-Bokaro is designed to process 1 MMSCMD of CBM gas and handle 750 m3/day of produced water. Currently, 55 wells are connected with GCS-Bokaro and are flowing well fluids, including CBM gas and produced water, which have been used for the Performance Guarantee Test Run (PGTR) and commissioning of the installation. Unlike conventional gas wells, CBM wells require dewatering through artificial lift pumps before achieving sustained gas production.

"Saudi Arabia's plan to cut oil production will be risky for global economy: Fatih Birol Updated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:21 AM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:21 AM IST\n\nParis: The analysis of the International Energy Agency has predicted that the effect of Saudi Arabia\'s plan to cut oil production will be risky for the global economy and that the markets would be very tight in the second half of this year. On Saudi Arabia\'s announcement of cutting oil production, Fatih Biral, Executive Director of, the International Energy Agency said, ""Saudi Arabia, Russia and others- the OPEC plus producers decided to cut the oil production. And when we look at the International Energy Agency\'s analysis and the analysis of almost every serious institution looking at the oil markets, the second half of this year markets would be all very tight."" ""I found this decision risky for the global economy,"" he added. Responding to a question on the impact of cut of oil production on countries like India, Biral said, ""India is an energy importer country, oil importer country. The majority of the oil consumed in India is imported. Such a move could increase India\'s oil import bill and as such, a burden on the Indian economy and Indian consumers."" On the impact of Ukraine\'s war on energy, he said, ""Renewable energies are energies of peace. In addition to that, we also see that as a result of this war, Russia was a major world\'s number one natural gas exporter. More and more countries are producing and exporting gas. And we expected in the next two, three years of time, there will be a float of LNG coming to markets and as such would put downward pressure on the prices and ease gas supply security concerns."" Giving a response if the ban on Russian oil was working, he said, ""I think it depends on what the objective is. If the objective is still world gets Russian oil but the Russian revenues go down, then I think those measures reach their objective, because our numbers show that in one year of time, since February 24, when the war started, today, the Russian oil and gas export revenues declined, dropped by 60 per cent. If we consider that the oil and gas export revenues are a very important input for the Russian budget, this is a major challenge for the Russian economy."" Expressing his views on India being named as a prime country that imports crude and re-exporting refined oil to European countries, Fatih Biral said that it was a legitimate step. ""I think this is happening according to the international rules and regulations in terms of trade and financing rules. And India is doing this in a transparent way, and India is profiting having the importing of crude at a lower discounted price than the others. This is definitely a legitimate step,"" he said. The Executive Director of the International Energy Agency also gave his opinion on India\'s Mission LiFE and said, ""The Mission LiFE is, in my view, one of the most important measures that the global community can take in order to address our biggest challenge of climate change. A few weeks ago in Bangalore, I had the privilege to discuss with Prime Minister Modi on the Mission LiFE because International Energy Agency is conducting a study a big group of researchers, renowned researchers around the world, to tell the world, especially G-20 countries if the Mission LiFE is implemented by all the countries, how we can reduce the risks of climate change, how much emissions we can save and how much money we can keep in our pocket.""

"CNG penetration to rise to 18% by 2027 from 11% in 2022 Updated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:53 AM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:53 AM IST\n\nNew Delhi: Price revision led by the new gas pricing norm is likely to reignite compressed natural gas (CNG) adoption in passenger vehicles. According to a report by Corporate rating firm ICRA, CNG penetration is expected to rise to nearly 18 per cent by the year 2027. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved a new domestic natural gas pricing plan on April 6, 2023, with domestic gas price at 10 per cent of the monthly average of Indian Crude Basket and notified monthly. The revised structure led to a reduction in price of CNG by up to 10 per cent across cities and would limit material increases in the same going forward, with the Cabinet setting a ceiling price for gas produced from ONGC and OIL nomination blocks. Over the past one year, there has been a spurt in the price of CNG, led primarily by the hike in the prevalent natural gas price; factors such as increase in blending cost and depreciation of the Indian Rupee also contributed to multiple price hikes. ICRA said that the new gas pricing policy led to CNG prices declining to levels seen nearly a year ago, thereby providing relief to the consumers. Shamsher Dewan, Senior Vice-President and Group Head -- Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said, ""The new gas pricing policy has led to CNG prices declining to levels seen nearly a year ago, thereby providing relief to the consumers."" ""Rising gas prices slowed down the adoption of CNG powertrains in H2 CY2022, led by a decline in the running cost differential between petrol and CNG powertrains, and a consequent increase in the payback period for the latter. A decline in CNG prices has led to a reduction in the total cost of ownership (10-15 per cent lower than petrol powertrain) for the powertrain and is likely to aid adoption for it going forward; ICRA estimates CNG powertrain penetration to increase to levels of 18 per cent by CY2027, from 11 per cent in CY2022,"" Dewan added. CNG fueling infrastructure has been improving at a healthy pace across the country, with the fuel availability in tier-2 cities also improving. The government set an aggressive target to ramp up the number of CNG fueling stations across the country. Given the increasing popularity of CNG variants, leading OEMs have been increasing coverage of CNG across their product portfolio. The proportion of CNG, EVs and hybrids is likely to materially increase as a proportion of new vehicle sales over the next three to four years, with CNG expected to emerge as the second-most popular powertrain. The growth in penetration for these powertrains would also help the OEMs meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy norms, said the ICRA report.

"Is Oman's hard work with Yemen and Saudi Arabia paying off? On April 9, Saudi and Omani delegations met Houthi representatives in Sanaa to discuss a permanent ceasefire in Yemen. After more than eight years of warfare in the impoverished country, the meetings have led some to have cautious optimism that the fighting in Yemen may be winding down.\n\nAlthough the public still does not know much about the pending agreement, sources have indicated that it may include a six-month ceasefire, a reopening of borders and ports, payment of salaries for Yemenis across the country, reparation and compensation measures, and a withdrawal of all foreign forces from Yemen before a political process begins.\n\nSuch developments, should they be true, would show the extent to which Omani efforts to bring a negotiated solution to the war in Yemen have been productive.\n\nAs the only Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member that refused to take part in military operations in Yemen, Oman has had a unique balancing role in the Arabian Peninsula. Representatives of the different Yemeni factions, Saudi, Iranian, Russian, and American diplomats, as well as United Nations officials, have been to Muscat several times in recent years to discuss the Yemeni file.\n\n""Since the beginning … Oman has been the voice of reason, saying early on that military intervention wasn\'t the answer in Yemen but rather peaceful diplomatic political talks,"" Afrah Nasser, a non-resident fellow at Arab Center Washington DC, told Al Jazeera. ""Eight years on, Oman is demonstrating that it has always been right.""\n\nThe Saudis appeared ready to resolve their conflict with the Iran-backed Houthis because the cost of continued warfare was too high. ""Saudi Arabia has decided they want out of this war,"" Abdullah Baabood, an Omani scholar and visiting professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, told Al Jazeera. ""It is too costly for them, economically and politically.""\n\nWhen an agreement between longtime rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia was announced last month, China, justifiably, got vast amounts of credit for brokering it, leading some commentators to attribute much of the recent progress in Yemen to Beijing.\n\nBut when it comes to Riyadh-Tehran relations and how they reflect on the situation in Yemen, it was Muscat\'s years of diplomatic heavy lifting that let progress happen.\n\nIt has been working to bridge differences between the parties involved since 2015. With Iraq, it facilitated talks between the Saudis and Iranians that began in Baghdad in April 2021.\n\n""The Omanis have been critical partners in efforts to advance an end to the Yemen conflict … especially in maintaining an open dialogue with the Houthis,"" Gerald Feierstein, former US ambassador to Yemen, told Al Jazeera. ""Their mediation of Saudi-Houthi talks has been central to advancing initiatives to resolve outstanding issues related to the coalition intervention in the Yemen conflict.""\n\nOman enabled Saudi Arabia to pursue a dignified exit from Yemen, after reaching a compromise with the Houthis became more important. With Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman focused on developing the kingdom and making Vision 2030 successful, drone and rocket attacks from Yemen made Saudi Arabia a less attractive option for foreign companies and investors.\n\n""Previously, Riyadh taunted Oman for refusing to join the Saudi-led coalition in 2015, Saudi now recognises that Muscat\'s role is crucial in its efforts to bring the war to a close,"" said Veena Ali-Khan, a Yemen researcher at the International Crisis Group. ""In Muscat\'s view, Saudi is finally listening to them and prioritising a diplomatic approach, after eight years of conflict.""\n\nBy growing closer to Saudi Arabia since Sultan Haitham took the helm in early 2020 and maintaining relations with the Houthis and their backers in Tehran, Muscat is in a unique position vis-à-vis the Yemen situation. The April 2022 truce and its extensions, for example, were only possible because of Oman.\n\n""Oman has played a very important role in this by getting the two sides to talk and opening the … opportunity for them to negotiate and, at times, maybe putting some pressure on the Houthis to come to an agreement,"" explained Baabood.\n\n""Oman\'s persistence in showing the importance of peace talks is finally yielding results,"" added Nasser. ""Besides acting as a peacemaker and bringing the warring parties to direct talks, Oman\'s role today is … like a face-saver. The warring parties have been desperate to have this third party that could save their faces … an end to the conflict must come with no victory or loss announced.""\n\nMuscat\'s friends-of-all foreign policy has defined the country regionally since Sultan Qaboos ascended to the throne in 1970 – Oman has never severed relations with any country since Qaboos took power and the sultanate has a record of neutrality in regional and international conflicts.\n\n""Omanis have set a record for effective but also quiet diplomacy for nearly five decades and demonstrated rare accomplishments to date,"" Joseph A Kéchichian, a senior fellow at the King Faisal Centre in Riyadh, told Al Jazeera.\n\nSharing a 300km (187-mile) border with Yemen, Oman will always have vested interests in its neighbour. ""Yemen is the sultanate\'s back yard and … one of four strategic areas of concern [besides Iran, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia], so what happens south of the border matters a great deal. Sultan Haitham and his team of advisers, most of whom were skillfully trained by his predecessor, have been heavily involved in secret discussions with the Houthis,"" said Kéchichian.\n\nWhat Oman seeks in Yemen is stability that does not threaten the sultanate\'s own security. ""For Oman, a successful resolution of the conflict would mean an end to the civil war in Yemen, a return to some semblance of national governance in Sanaa that would maintain good relations with all of Yemen\'s neighbours, and opportunities for Yemenis to achieve economic stability,"" explained Feierstein.\n\n""From a national security perspective, the Omanis would like to see security on their border with Yemen strengthened and stability, in particular in Yemen\'s eastern governorates of Mahra and Hadramawt, to prevent any spillover into Oman,"" he added.\n\n""Muscat wants the kind of peace and security that will eliminate regional tensions and, consequently, encourage the creation of wealth for everyone,"" Kéchichian told Al Jazeera. ""Its agenda … is to be on friendly terms with friends and on correct terms with foes.\n\nIt seeks harmony when possible but believes that it must always operate from a position of strength, which is why it takes its defence duties seriously, even if budgetary constraints limit its outlook. This is a sophisticated approach that aims to show results to its citizens, neighbours, and global powers. The results are rewarding as the country earns worldwide respect. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/is-omans-hard-work-with-yemen-and-saudi-arabia-paying-off"

"Petrofac issues trading update ahead of the announcement of its full year results Petrofac has issued a trading update ahead of the announcement of its full year results for the year ending 31 December 2022.\n\nDuring the extended post-balance sheet period for the Group's full year 2022 consolidated financial statements, management has conducted a thorough review of the portfolio of contracts, associated outstanding contractual and commercial issues and opportunities to improve liquidity by accelerating working capital inflows.\n\nAs a result of the portfolio review, the Group is recognising an additional EBIT reduction of US$140 million to US$160 million in the full year financial statements for 2022. This comprises both incremental project costs and a cautious view of the quantum and timing of recognition of certain revenue claims that would have partly offset those costs.\n\nAs a consequence, Petrofac now expects to report a full year Group EBIT loss of approximately US$150 million to US$170 million for 2022, including an EBIT loss of approximately US$240 million to US$260 million in Engineering & Construction (E&C) (1).\n\nApproximately 50% of these additional costs are expected to be paid over the remainder of 2023, with the balance spread over 2024 and 2025. Any future recoveries from clients would mitigate this outflow.\n\nThai Oil Clean Fuels: following the December 2022 Trading Update, the execution strategy for this uniquely complex project has been subject to further review during Q1 2023, in consultation and cooperation with our client and joint venture partners. In order to de-risk delivery, operational changes have been made, including changes to subcontractors. A significant proportion of the resulting costs are expected to be recovered but discussions have not yet reached a sufficient level of maturity to recognise this incremental revenue.\n\nLegacy contracts: additional costs relate to final completion activities on our legacy portfolio, primarily on projects that are now substantially completed (2). The figures announced today also include an allowance for adverse settlements as part of our efforts to accelerate the release of working capital balances.\n\nNet debt at 31 December 2022 was US$349 million (3), with liquidity of US$506 million (4).\n\nPetrofac remains focused on ensuring the Group has sufficient liquidity to support its strategy, including unlocking the significant working capital balances built up over the period of the pandemic, as well as collecting cash advances on new awards.\n\nThe Group has made significant progress in extending its borrowing facilities, having reached agreement in principle with its lenders to extend all three facilities by 12 months to October 2024. We will update the market following the signing of the extension agreements.\n\nTareq Kawash, Petrofac's Group Chief Executive as of 1 April 2023, commented:\n\n'Petrofac's focus is on completing legacy contracts as quickly, efficiently and safely as possible. We are taking steps to ensure the financial strength of the business by unlocking working capital and, where appropriate, balancing long-term value against near-term liquidity.\n\n'Although we are disappointed to announce additional costs on these legacy contracts, in particular the Thai Oil Clean Fuels project, ongoing collaboration with clients and partners will de-risk future delivery.\n\n'I joined Petrofac because the business has a significant opportunity to deploy its leading capabilities to help clients deliver much needed energy infrastructure. This was demonstrated in the recent significant award of a long-term agreement to support critical European offshore wind infrastructure. Alongside converting a healthy pipeline of future opportunities – with a number of awards at preferred bidder stage – we are working to draw a line under the projects of the past, putting Petrofac in a strong position to deliver future growth.'\n\nOriginal article link https://www.energy-pedia.com/news/general/petrofac-issues-trading-update-ahead-of-the-announcement-of-its-full-year-results-191155"

"Japan to develop long-range missiles as tensions with China rise Japan on Tuesday announced plans to develop and build an array of advanced long-range missiles as it bolsters its defenses amid increasing tensions with neighboring China.\n\nThe Japanese Defense Ministry said it had signed contracts with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) to develop and mass produce the weapons under a plan extending to 2027.\n\nThe deals, worth more than $2.8 billion according to Reuters, follow Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\'s announcement in December that he planned to boost defense spending and enable Japan to possess ""counterstrike capabilities,"" the ability to directly attack another country\'s territory in the event of an emergency and under specific circumstances.\n\nIn taking the new defense initiatives, Japan is bending the interpretation of its post-World War II constitution, which put constraints on its Self-Defense Forces in that they can only be used for what their name implies, defending the Japanese homeland.\n\nUnder the deals, MHI will begin mass production this year on two types of already developed missiles – ground-launched Type 12 guided missiles designed to target ships at sea and hypersonic glide missiles designed for island defense, the ministry said. Deployment of those weapons is scheduled for 2026 and 2027, it said.\n\nThe Defense Ministry news release did not say how many of each missile would be acquired.\n\nMeanwhile, MHI will this year begin development of advanced versions of the Type 12 that can also be launched by aircraft and ships. Defense industry news site Janes reported that the updgraded Type 12 will have a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), five times the reach of the current version.\n\nAt the same time, MHI will begin development of submarine-launched missiles that could be fired by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force\'s fleet of conventionally powered boats.\n\nIn December, Kishida instructed his defense and finance ministers to secure funds to increase Japan\'s defense budget to 2% of current GDP in 2027.\n\nAlong with the development of Japan\'s own missiles, Kishida said in February the country planned to buy as many as 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States. Tomahawks can hit targets as far as 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) away.\n\nJapan\'s military buildup comes amid increasing tensions with China, which has been growing its naval and air forces in areas near Japan while claiming the Senkaku Islands, an uninhabited Japanese-controlled chain in the East China Sea, as its sovereign territory.\n\nMeanwhile, China has been upping its military pressure on Taiwan, the self-ruled island whose security Japanese leaders have said is vital to that of Japan.\n\nJust this week, Japan scrambled fighter jets as a Chinese aircraft carrier group came within 230 kilometers (143 miles) of the southern Japanese island of Miyako while it simulated strikes on Taiwan.\n\nChinese military exercises around Taiwan last August including the launching of ballistic missiles, some of which landed in Japan\'s Exclusive Economic Zone. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/asia/japan-hypersonic-missiles-intl-hnk-ml/index.html"
"Kazakhstan takes oil majors to arbitration over costs Published On Apr 11, 2023 at 01:16 PM IST\n\nPublished On Apr 11, 2023 at 01:16 PM IST\n\nEni, Shell and KazMunayGaz are also partners in Karachaganak, alongside Chevron and LUKOIL. Kazakhstan has started arbitration proceedings against companies developing its giant Kashagan and Karachaganak oilfields overUSD13 billion andUSD3.5 billion, respectively, in deducted costs, Energy Minister Almasadam Satkaliyev said on Tuesday. ""I can only say these lawsuits have been filed in the interest of the people of Kazakhstan,"" Satkaliyev told reporters, refusing to provide any further details about the claims. The offshore Kashagan field, one of the biggest discoveries in recent decades, is being developed by Eni, Shell , TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, KazMunayGas, Inpex and CNPC. Eni, Shell and KazMunayGaz are also partners in Karachaganak, alongside Chevron and LUKOIL. Both projects are covered by production sharing agreements stipulating that companies can deduct certain costs from income before splitting it with the government. The size of the deductions claimed by the companies would determine how much income there is to be split between them and the government. Kashagan and Karachaganak are the second- and third-biggest producers of oil respectively in the Central Asian nation whose economy relies heavily on energy exports. The Astana government has already had a series of disputes with its partners about the terms of oil deals, which typically ended with settlements.

"Vedanta Ltd in talks with US-based Farallon to raise $1 billion: Report Updated On Apr 11, 2023 at 04:19 PM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 11, 2023 at 04:19 PM IST\n\nVedanta Ltd., billionaire Anil Agarwal's Indian commodities major, is in talks with US-based Farallon Capital Management to raise at least $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The structure of the fund-raising hasn't been finalized, and discussions are ongoing, said the people who declined to be identified as the talks are private. The proposal, if it comes to fruition, will lessen the need to raise money through a syndicated loan, one of the people said. Agarwal has been relying on dividends from the Mumbai-listed company to repay debts at his London vehicle, which has faced mounting investor concerns over its cash flows as interest rates soared. Other plans to raise money had met with challenges. Vedanta didn't respond to an email and phone calls seeking comments. An email to Farallon Capital was unanswered. The company had also been in talks with at least three banks including Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc for a syndicated dollar-denominated loan. Last month, it announced plans to hand out a fifth dividend for the financial year ending March.

"Oil steady after surprise build in US crude stocks Updated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:21 AM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:21 AM IST\n\nOil prices were little changed in early trading on Wednesday after industry data showed an unexpected build in US crude and gasoline inventories, offsetting concerns about tightening supply ahead of output cuts by OPEC producers. In a sign of market tightness, US crude futures have flipped into backwardation, with the front month contract trading 6 cents higher than the second month. Brent crude fell 5 cents at $85.57 a barrel by 0029 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate fell 6 cents to $81.48 a barrel. Data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed crude inventories rose by about 380,000 barrels in the week ended April 7, sources said, against forecasts from eight analysts polled by Reuters for a decline of 600,000 barrels. At the same time, gasoline inventories rose by about 450,000 barrels, according to the API report, while analysts had expected a 1.6 million-barrel drawdown. The US government will release its stockpile data at 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. Prices had risen about 2% on Tuesday on hopes that the Federal Reserve might slow its policy tightening after US consumer prices data releases on Wednesday. Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said he feels the US central bank may soon be done raising interest rates, while Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he believes inflation, now at a rate of 5% by the Fed\'s preferred measure, will get to ""the mid-threes"" by the end of this year. The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that lurking financial system vulnerabilities could erupt into a new crisis and hurt global growth this year, but urged member countries to keep tightening monetary policy to fight persistently high inflation. Monthly reports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are due on Thursday and the International Energy Agency on Friday, which will update oil demand and supply forecasts.

"Surprise Leaks Reveal Nvidia's RTX 4070 Performance And Design The latest leaks surrounding Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 give us the clearest picture yet of what the card will look like and how it will perform.\n\nThe RTX 4070 Founders Edition\n\nFirstly, the Founders Edition model, which will be available direct from Nvidia, has been pictured and shows a similar cooler design to the RTX 3080. The cooler has the familiar flow-through fan design, but appears to be considerably smaller than the Founders Edition model of the RTX 4070 Ti.\n\nTwitter user @GiannisDavid revealed photos of what appears to be an RTX 4070 Founders Edition\n\nThe card also features the new 12VHPWR connector, so this model at least will not use standard 8-pin connectors as has been rumored for partner card models. Instead, Nvidia will likely be bundling an 8-pin splitter cable adaptor in the box instead so it will still be compatible with older power supplies.\n\nNvidia's RTX 4070 Founders Edition will use the new 12-pin power cable.\n\nNvidia's own graphs that were leaked recently on website Videocardz, show that the RTX 4070 should perform similarly to the RTX 3080 without the use of DLSS or frame generation, but will beat the older card when using those features. This could paint the RTX 4070 in a favorable light given the RTX 3080 is usually retailing for over $700 and the RTX 4070 is expected to sit under this price for standard models.\n\nThe RTX 4070 is slated to perform similarly to the RTX 3080\n\nFurther evidence of performance comes from leaked 3DMark figures, which put the RTX 4070 on par with the RTX 3080 on average, flitting between five percent above and below depending on the benchmark. Meanwhile, it was significantly slower than the RTX 4070 Ti, recording an average 20 percent lower score. This is to be expected as is set to retail $200-300 lower and with a noticeably lower specification.\n\nAccording to various sources, the RTX 4070 is due to launch on April 13th with benchmark reviews out today. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2023/04/12/surprise-leaks-reveal-nvidias-rtx-4070-performance-and-design/"
"Elon Musk says owning Twitter 'extremely painful' - latest updates Elon Musk has said owning Twitter has been ""extremely painful"" in a surprise, late-night interview with the BBC.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire, who acquired Twitter last year, said the company was being run ""like a non-profit"" and ""spending money like it\'s going out of fashion"" when he took charge.\n\nHe has been slashing jobs in an effort to bring down costs and Mr Musk admitted Twitter now had just 1,500 staff, down from 8,000 people when he took over the social network.\n\nMr Musk made the admission in a ""spontaneous"" interview with the BBC following a row over Twitter\'s decision to label the broadcaster a ""government-funded"" outlet.\n\nMr Musk said he would agree to alter the label to ""publicly funded"". Mr Musk said: ""We want it to as truthful and accurate as possible - we\'re adjusting the label.""\n\nThe Twitter owner had frustrated BBC bosses by adding a disclaimer that it was ""government funded media"" to its account.\n\nThe BBC had insisted it was independent of government. It is funded through the licence fee.\n\nShares in South Korean electronics giant LG skipped up 10pc in trading in Seoul today after British fund Silchester International Investors was revealed as a shareholder.\n\nIn a stock market filing, Silchester disclosed it had a 5pc stake in the £9bn South Korean company. LG has been grappling in recent months falling profits as demand for consumer electronics declines.\n\nRough-diamond sales increased by 8.65pc over the last three months amid an economic recovery in China driving demand for luxury jewelry, Anglo American has said.\n\nDe Beers, which is majority-owned by the miner, said in a market statement it expected to sell $540m of diamonds in its second sales cycle of the year.\n\n""We have continued to see good demand for our rough diamonds over the third sales cycle of the year as we move into the second quarter of 2023,"" said Al Cook, chief executive of De Beers.\n\n""Sales were in line with expectations and we continue to see some encouraging positive trends in consumer demand for diamond jewellery, not least in China where we\'re beginning to see some signs of recovery in consumer confidence following the relaxation of travel restrictions.""\n\nAway from this morning\'s interview, Elon Musk has been buying up powerful computer processors in a bid to develop technology to rival that of OpenAI\'s ChatGPT.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has been acquiring graphics processing units (GPUs) for Twitter in an effort to develop so-called ""generative AI"", Insider reports.\n\nMr Musk has reportedly acquired 10,000 processors to begin the machine learning training needed to create powerful algorithms similar to those being built by OpenAI.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is up slightly at 0.04pc, trading at around 7,788.\n\nElon Musk said his takeover of Twitter had been ""extremely painful"" - and it could be about to get even more uncomfortable.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Twitter are forecast to plunge by 28pc this year, according to estimates from Insider Intelligence.\n\nThe report found that Twitter advertising income would slip to around $2.98bn this year, down from $4.14bn in 2022 and $4.46bn in 2021.\n\nInterviewed in the early hours of this morning, Elon Musk claimed he is no longer officially chief executive of Twitter - he\'s given the job to his dog.\n\nThe billionaire claimed that the dog, a Shiba Inu named Floki, was now running Twitter.\n\nMr Musk also responded to questions from the BBC after he branded the organisation a government-funded media organisation.\n\n""I know the BBC wasn\'t thrilled to about being labelled state affiliated media,"" Mr Musk said, laughing. He said he planned to change the label to ""publicly funded"" which is ""not too objectionable"".\n\nOk so usually the interviewee leaves the interview. Elon musk now taking questions on Spaces pic.twitter.com/x9JKfzdtpT\n\n-- James Clayton (@JamesClayton5) April 12, 2023\n\nMr Musk also addressed criticisms of his decision to strip the New York Times of its ""blue tick"" on the social network after it refused to pay about $1,000 per month for the verification badge.\n\n""It\'s a small amount of money, so I don\'t know what their problem is... we\'re going to treat everyone equally.""\n\nHe added he did not want Twitter to feature ""some anointed class of journalists"" compared to the public.\n\nThe availability of workers improved for the first time since 2021 as job seekers returned to the market after hundreds of thousands dropped out of the labour market during the pandemic.\n\nThe number of temporary workers seeking employment rose to its highest level in six months, according to a survey by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), offsetting continued tightness in permanent roles.\n\nThe loosening labour market was partly down to a rise in the number of redundancies, the report said, as companies opted for temporary hires over new permanent roles. Improving pay offers were also encouraging people to return to the job market.\n\nNeil Carberry, chief executive of NEC, said: ""The big news is that candidate availability is up for the first time in more than two years. This suggests that, while the market is still tight, it should be getting gradually easier for firms to hire over the next few months. ""\n\n""The continuing fast rate of pay growth is likely reflective of the impact of inflation on wage offers, as well as low labour supply.

"Opinion: OPEC  surprise squeezed oil shorts Updated On Apr 12, 2023 at 10:52 AM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 12, 2023 at 10:52 AM IST\n\nLONDON: Investors bought petroleum futures and options at the fastest rate for more than three years after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC  producer group members announced voluntary cuts in oil output. Hedge funds and other money managers bought the equivalent of 128 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts over the seven days to April 4. The buying came as OPEC  announced cuts totalling more than 1 million barrels per day on April 2 and after fund managers had already purchased 61 million barrels the previous week. Purchases centred on crude, in both Brent ( 73 million barrels) and NYMEX and ICE WTI ( 60 million barrels), with small sales of European gas oil (-2 million) and US diesel (-3 million) and no change in US gasoline. CRUDE SQUEEZE With its surprise announcement, OPEC  successfully squeezed the shorts in crude petroleum, with bearish positions reduced to the lowest for 11 weeks since late January. Since March 21, funds have purchased a total of 174 million barrels of crude, the fastest rate since December 2019 and before that September 2017. Bearish short positions were cut by 113 million barrels while fund managers added 61 million barrels of new bullish long positions. The net long position was boosted to 400 million barrels (28th percentile for all weeks since 2013) from 226 million (1st percentile) on March 21. And the ratio of bullish long positions to bearish short ones surged to 5.39:1 (64th percentile) from 2.11:1 (8th percentile) two weeks earlier. As a result, production cuts have returned hedge fund positions to where they were in late January, before turmoil in the banking sector in March sparked a wave of selling. Chartbook: Oil and gas positions US NATURAL GAS Hedge funds reduced their position in Henry Hub futures and options in the seven days ending on April 4 for the first time in six weeks. Positions were trimmed by 55 billion cubic feet after being raised by 1,151 billion cubic feet over the previous five weeks. Fund managers have generally become less bearish about gas prices as Freeport LNG's terminal has resumed exporting. Freeport's resumption should stabilise then gradually erase some of the surplus inventories accumulated since the third quarter of 2022. Portfolio managers still have a small overall short position of -105 billion cubic feet (28th percentile for all weeks since 2010) but it has been sharply reduced from -1,061 billion cubic feet (7th percentile) at the end of January.

"NYPD's Spot Robot is back for use in 'hazardous situations' Back in 2021, the New York Police Department (NYPD) cancelled a planned deployment of the Spot robot dog [aka ""Digidog""] following a public backlash. Now, New York City\'s current law and order mayor Eric Adams has brought the robot dog back for use in ""hazardous situations,"" The New York Times has reported. ""Digidog is out of the pound,"" Adams said at a press conference yesterday in Times Square.\n\nThe NYPD will acquire two of the robots for $750,000 and only use them in hostage and other critical situations. ""I believe that technology is here; we cannot be afraid of it,"" Adams said. ""A few loud people were opposed to it, and we took a step back [but] that is not how I operate. I operate on looking at what\'s best for the city.""\n\nSpot/Digidog is built by Hyundai\'s Boston Dynamics, and is designed to be used in dangerous situations like security and inspections. It was also tested for use in combat by the French army, primarily for reconnaissance.\n\nDuring its previous tour of duty with the NYPD, police used Spot to gather information about a gunmen barricaded inside a building. On another occasion it was deployed during a home invasion, also to give officers eyes inside the house. After critics brought up potential concerns over surveillance and privacy, however, then-mayor Bill de Blasio elected to cancel a $94,000 lease on Spot. ""It\'s creepy, alienating and sends the wrong message to New Yorkers,"" a city spokesperson said at the time.\n\nGreat deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget\'s editorial team. See latest\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\nPlease select a newsletter\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget\'s Terms and Privacy Policy.\n\nAlong with Digidog, the NYPD announced testing of two other types of security and surveillance tech. The Guardian HX from StarChase shoots GPS tracking tags onto vehicles from a handheld or car-mounted launcher, allowing officers to find them without the needed for a chase. The other is the Knightscope\'s K5 ASR, a ""fully autonomous outdoor security robot"" that the NYPD wants to use for collecting intelligence.\n\n""This is the beginning of a series of rollouts we are going to do to show how public safety has transformed itself,"" Adams said at the press conference. However, the move was condemned by Albert Fox Cahn from the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. ""The NYPD is turning bad science fiction into terrible policing,"" he told the NYT in a statement.

"Elon Musk said he dresses his Shiba Inu, who he says is the CEO of Twitter, like Elizabeth Holmes Twitter CEO Elon Musk told the BBC that his dog Floki is the CEO of the social media platform and that he dresses it in black turtlenecks -- the outfits disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes was known for wearing.\n\nDuring a live interview on Twitter Spaces with BBC journalist James Clayton, Musk kept correcting Clayton when the latter called Musk Twitter\'s CEO.\n\n""I\'m not the CEO of Twitter. My dog is the CEO of Twitter. He\'s a great dog, very alert, and it\'s hard to get anything by him,"" Musk joked.\n\nResponding to Clayton\'s earlier question of who Musk\'s successor as CEO would be, he again insisted that Floki had secured the position.\n\n""He\'s got a black turtleneck, what do you need?"" Musk said in the interview, which took place at Twitter\'s headquarters in San Francisco on Tuesday night.\n\nClayton asked Musk: ""Steve Jobs or Elizabeth Holmes, are you making a reference to?""\n\n""I guess more Elizabeth Holmes. He\'s got a husky voice,"" Musk said.\n\nHolmes is the former CEO of the failed blood-testing startup Theranos. She was convicted in January 2022 and sentenced in November to more than 11 years in prison on four wire fraud charges.\n\nOn Monday, a judge denied her request to remain free while appealing her conviction. She is scheduled to report to prison on April 27.\n\nThe BBC interview was one of several occasions that Musk has joked about his dog being Twitter CEO. In February, he tweeted a photo of the Shiba Inu sitting at a desk, wearing a black shirt with the word ""CEO"" on it.\n\n""The new CEO of Twitter is amazing,"" Musk wrote in his tweet on February 14.\n\nMusk\'s affection for his dog has even pushed him to change Twitter\'s interface.\n\nOn April 3, Musk replaced Twitter\'s bird logo with the Shiba Inu -- or doge -- meme. Following this change, the price of dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that Musk supports, soared 20%.\n\nA separate meme cryptocurrency token named after his dog Floki rose 200% in value this year, beating out other Musk favorites like dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nMusk has owned a wide range of pets other than his Shiba Inu. He once had a dog named Hobbes -- after Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century philosopher -- which was a Yorkshire Terrier that Musk called ""nasty, brutish & short.""\n\nIn April 2019, Musk tweeted that he has ""a big dog called Gatsby, a little dog called Marvin the Martian & a cat named Schrödinger.""\n\nX, Musk\'s son with the singer, Grimes, was also seen playing with Floki and two other dogs in a tweet posted in August.\n\nMusk and a representative for Holmes did not immediately respond to Insider\'s requests for comment sent outside regular business hours. https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-calls-dog-twitter-ceo-dresses-it-elizabeth-holmes-2023-4"
"Oil rises on China stimulus expectations, weaker dollar Published On Apr 11, 2023 at 01:25 PM IST\n\nPublished On Apr 11, 2023 at 01:25 PM IST\n\nCHENNAI: Oil prices rose on Tuesday on expectations of potential economic stimulus by China, healthy demand in the rest of Asia and a drop in US crude stockpiles. Brent crude futures rose 64 cents, or 0.8 per cent, to $84.82 a barrel at 0557 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate futures gained 67 cents, or 0.8 per cent, to $80.41 a barrel. Data from China showed that consumer inflation in March hit the slowest pace since September 2021, suggesting demand weakness persists amid an uneven economic recovery, which spurred expectations Beijing may take steps to boost growth. ""China\'s March CPI is lower than expected, which may promote the Chinese government to further stimulate the economy,"" said Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets. Crude futures also climbed as the dollar eased on expectations that the US Federal Reserve is getting closer to ending its rate hike cycle. A weaker greenback makes oil cheaper for those holding other currencies. ""With more central banks pausing rate hikes, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank of Korea ... the expectation for the Fed to further scale back its tightening policy has been strengthened,"" Teng said. Signs of strong fuel demand in India, the world\'s third-biggest oil consumer, in March also supported prices. Last month, fuel consumption jumped by 5 per cent from a year earlier to a record 4.83 million barrels per day. Oil futures have climbed more than 5 per cent since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia surprised the market last week with a new round of production cuts starting in May. On the US supply front, industry data on US crude stockpiles is due on Tuesday. Five analysts polled by Reuters estimated on average that crude inventories fell by about 1.3 million barrels in the week to April 7. A US inflation report to be released on Wednesday could help investors gauge the near-term trajectory for interest rates.

"Russia starts fuel supplies to Iran by rail: sources Published On Apr 11, 2023 at 05:22 PM IST\n\nPublished On Apr 11, 2023 at 05:22 PM IST\n\nMOSCOW: Russia started fuel exports to Iran by rail this year for the first time after traditional buyers shunned trade with Moscow, according to three industry sources and exports data. Russia and Iran, both under Western sanctions, are forging closer ties in order to support their economies and to undermine Western sanctions which both Moscow and Tehran cast as unjustified. Western sanctions on Russian oil products over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine have reshaped global fuel markets with tankers taking longer routes and suppliers choosing exotic destinations and ways of transportation. Iran has been under Western sanctions for years with limited access to global markets. The oil ministries of Russia and Iran did not reply to requests for comment. Last autumn Russia\'s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced the start of swap supplies of oil products with Iran, but actual shipments only started this year, Reuters sources said. In February and March Russia supplied up to 30,000 tonnes of gasoline and diesel to Iran, two sources familiar with the export data told Reuters. A third source confirmed the trade but was not able to confirm the volumes. All the volumes were supplied by rail from Russia via Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. One of the sources said that some gasoline cargoes were sent on from Iran to neighbouring states, including Iraq, by truck. Iran is an oil producer and has its own refineries, but recently its consumption had exceeded domestic fuel production, especially in its northern provinces, a trader in Central Asian oil products market said. Russia had supplied small volumes of fuel to Iran by tanker via the Caspian Sea, as was the case in 2018, two traders familiar with the matter said. Russian oil companies are currently interested in exporting diesel and gasoline to Iran by rail as exports by sea face high freight rates and a price cap imposed by the G7 countries. However the rail exports face bottlenecks along the route, the sources said. ""We expect fuel supplies to Iran to rise this year, but we already see several issues with logistics due to rail congestion. That may keep exports from booming,"" one of the sources familiar with supplies to Iran said.

"OPEC  output cut may lead to higher oil prices, push up India's import bill: IEA Updated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:51 AM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:51 AM IST\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) on Tuesday termed the decision of OPEC  to cut oil production as ""risky for the global economy"", saying it may push up already high prices, leading to higher import bills for nations like India. Global oil markets were already set to tighten in the second half of 2023, with the potential for a substantial supply deficit to emerge, said Fatih Birol, head of the Paris-based energy watchdog. Talking to reporters after a bilateral meeting with India\'s Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal here, he said, ""The cut of the additional production would mean that we have all the reasons to believe that there could be an upward pressure on the prices"". ""At this juncture of time when the global economy is still very fragile and many emerging countries have difficulties with economic performance, I found this decision risky for the global economy,"" he noted. Asked if oil prices could go past USD 100 per barrel again, he said, ""I think we are all the day but USD 85 now, and looking at the second half of this year, I have reasons to believe that it can go even higher at current levels"". Higher oil prices will not just translate into inflationary pressure on other commodities but will also lead to a larger import bill for nations like India, which are dependent on overseas supplies to meet their requirements. ""India is an energy important country, oil important country, a majority of the oil consumed in India is important, such a move could increase India\'s oil import bill and as such a burden on the Indian economy and Indian consumers,"" Birol said. Goyal is here to meet his counterpart and French CEOs to promote trade and investments between the two countries. India is the world\'s third-largest oil-importing and consuming nation. It meets 85 per cent of oil needs through imports. It spent USD 118 billion on oil imports in the first 11 months of the 2022-23 fiscal. Birol said India\'s economy is strong and continues to be stronger. ""We expect the Indian economy will soon be the third largest economy of the world and the growing economy needs... we do revise our numbers all the time but I expect that the Indian economy will still be strong this year, one of the strongest in the world. And as such, we require strong oil and electricity demand,"" he said. On Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, he said the war has led to a big push for clean energy solutions. ""In addition to that, we also see that as a result of this war, Russia was a major world\'s number one natural gas exporter. More and more countries are producing and exporting gas and we expect in the next two to three years... there will be a float of LNG coming to markets and as such, would put downward pressure on the prices and ease gas supply security concerns."" Asked about the impact of sanctions on Russia, he said the objective of reducing Russian oil revenue has been achieved. ""Our numbers show that in one year of time since the 24th of February, when the war started, the Russian oil and gas export revenues declined, dropping by 60 per cent. If we consider that the oil and gas export revenues are a very important input for the Russian budget, it is a major challenge for the Russian economy."" Russian oil is being sold at a discount to international benchmarks because some Western nations have stopped buying it and their insurance companies are no longer providing cover for ships carrying such oil. India is one of the countries, which utilised the opportunity to buy discount oil to cut its import bill. The IEA head said India was doing this in a transparent way and within the international rules and regulations. ""And India is profiting by...importing of crude at a lower discounted price than the others. This is definitely a legitimate step.""

"Italy Greenlights The Sale Of A Russian-Owned Refinery The Italian government has given conditional approval for the sale of a refinery owned by Russia\'s Lukoil to a Cyprus-based private equity firm, Reuters has reported, citing unnamed sources in the know.\n\nThe conditions set by the Italian government for buyer G.O.I. Energy include guarantees that no jobs will be cut and a commitment to secure crude oil for the refinery from producers other than Russia.\n\nTo greenlight the deal, the government used its ""golden power"" prerogative that allows it to review and approve deals that are considered to be of strategic importance in industries including energy, banking, and healthcare.\n\nThe ISAB refinery, located in southern Italy, has a capacity of 320,000 bpd, accounting for as much as 20 percent of Italy\'s total refining capacity. Its continued operation came under threat last year, however, when the European Union imposed an embargo on Russian crude oil imports.\n\nIn response, as a temporary measure, the Italian government put the refinery under trusteeship, with a sale seen as the best course of action going forward. In case the refinery could not be sold, the government considered nationalizing it.\n\nAt the time, there were reports that Crossbridge Energy Partners, a U.S.-based private equity group, was in talks to buy the refinery from Lukoil, and that a deal could see the refinery valued at over $1 billion.\n\nIn January, however, it emerged that Lukoil is considering a sale to the Cypriot private equity company, which is financially backed by commodity major Trafigura.\n\nCyprus-based G.O.I Energy is run by Israeli Green Oil CEO Michael Bobrov, according to Reuters, while Green Oil holds a major stake in Bazan Group, Israel\'s largest refiner.\n\nThe deal will allow Western-based Trafigura to handle oil supplies for the Italian refinery, should the Italian government agree to the sale. At the time, Lukoil expected the sale to close by the end of March.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Italy-Greenlights-The-Sale-Of-A-Russian-Owned-Refinery.html"

"Indian crude basket yet to factor in discounted Russian buys Updated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:49 AM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 12, 2023 at 07:49 AM IST\n\nThe price of the Indian basket of crude oil, meant to broadly represent the cost of the country\'s crude imports, has yet to begin accounting for the deeply discounted Russian oil that\'s flooding the country. Since domestic refiners currently depend on Russia for about a third of their requirements, the true cost of imports would be much lower than the one represented by the Indian basket. ""There would be domestic implications for this in policymaking and consumer prices,"" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research. The Indian basket of crude oil has been a key reference for the government on policy matters, taxation and gas prices. The domestic natural gas price is equal to 10 per cent of the Indian basket crude price in the previous month. The petroleum and natural gas ministry did not respond to ET\'s queries. The Indian basket represents a derived basket comprising sour grade and sweet grade of crude oil processed in Indian refineries in the ratio of 75.62: 24.38, said the ministry\'s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). The cell uses two global benchmarks - Dubai and Oman average for sour grade and Dated Brent for sweet - to determine the Indian basket price. The weighted average of these benchmarks has for years served well to broadly represent imported crude cost, said a ministry official, adding that the basket wasn\'t meant to represent the actual import costs as refiners don\'t share those details, including the prices for Russian oil, with PPAC. The Gulf countries have traditionally been India\'s top supplier, mainly of sour grades, with prices mostly linked to the Dubai and Oman average. Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, Russia\'s flagship crude oil Urals has sold for $20-30 per barrel discount to Brent, the most popular oil benchmark. The Urals sold for nearly the same price as Brent before the war. The share of Russian oil in Indian imports has risen to 35 per cent in recent months, up from about 20 per cent for the entire 2022-23. ""We believe that this discount on Russian crude is a temporary phenomenon, which is expected to taper off going forward as the situation between Russia and Ukraine eases. Therefore, the need to modify or change the Indian crude basket at the moment doesn\'t seem to be necessary,"" said Sourav Mitra, director-consulting, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics.

"Anti-abortion group urges federal appeals court to uphold suspension of mifepristone approval WASHINGTON – A coalition of anti-abortion groups told a federal appeals court early Wednesday it should suspend a common abortion pill called mifepristone, the latest development in a case that has captured nationwide attention since a controversial ruling last week jeopardized a more than two-decade-old approval of the drug.\n\nThe Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, which is challenging the Food and Drug Administration\'s approval of mifepristone in 2000, asked the Louisiana-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to uphold the lower court\'s pause on the drug\'s approval while the underlying questions raised by the high-profile lawsuit are decided.\n\nThe group said the lower court\'s order ""paints an alarming picture of decades-long agency lawlessness."" The public, the group told the appeals court in its filing, has ""no interest in maintaining unlawful agency"" approval of the drug and asserted that the lower court\'s order ""merely removes mifepristone from the mails and the market."" Abortion, the group said, ""will still be available in states that permit it.""\n\nThe Biden administration on Monday appealed a decision by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would effectively revoke the FDA approval. Kacsmaryk, nominated to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump, paused his own ruling for one week.\n\nIn its appeal, the Biden administration sought to extend that pause. The latest filing was the group\'s response to that request.\n\nReaction:Biden will fight, not ignore, abortion pill ruling suspending mifepristone\n\nSCOTUS:Mifepristone rulings set up first post-Roe abortion case at Supreme Court\n\nBig picture:How abortion landscape has changed since the end of Roe v. Wade\n\nThe government\'s lawyers told the appeals court on Monday that the FDA has determined mifepristone is safe and effective to terminate early pregnancies in a decision that five presidential administrations upheld. Serious adverse effects are ""exceedingly rare,"" as they are for common drugs such as ibuprofen, the department said in its filings earlier this week,\n\nA three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit is expected to decide by the end of the week whether to extend the stay of Kacsmaryk\'s ruling or let it expire. If it chooses to let it expire, the Biden administration would likely appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe and Bart Jansen, USA TODAY https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/11/abortion-mifepristone-fifth-circuit-appeals-court/11642853002/"
"Chip Stocks ASML, Lam Research And Breakout Stock Five Below Trigger This Bullish Indicator Among the top stocks to buy and watch in the ongoing stock market rally, ASML (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX), Asure Software (ASUR), Five Below (FIVE) and Xponential Fitness (XPOF) triggered a sign that confirms their stock market leadership.\n\nAll boast the Relative Strength Line Blue Dot in MarketSmith. The designation -- which appears in a MarketSmith screen -- focuses on ideas with market-beating performance. They could be big winners amid the ongoing confirmed uptrend in stocks.\n\nFirst, learn how to use the relative strength line. It measures a stock's price performance compared to the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, then the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.\n\nIBD readers should focus on stocks whose RS lines are hitting new highs during a stock's base formation or on the actual breakout. These stocks get institutional support during both weak and strong market environments.\n\nThe RS Line Blue Dot feature combines the relative strength line with MarketSmith Pattern Recognition. When a stock's RS line hits a new high while the stock is forming a base or breaking out, the Blue Dot appears on the MarketSmith weekly or daily chart.\n\nASML rose 0.5% midday Tuesday, continuing to rebound from the 50-day line and moving within striking distance of a cup-with-handle's 683.28 buy point.\n\nHeadquartered in the Netherlands, ASML produces the world's most-advanced lithography machines, an essential component in chip manufacturing. It is the only provider of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which enable the increasingly complex chips the world relies on. ASML's EUV technology is indispensable for industry giants like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA), which is an IBD Leaderboard stock.\n\nLam Research continues to trace a flat base with a 548.95 buy point. Lam Research supplies wafer fabrication equipment to the semiconductor industry. It is one of just three companies involved in etching and deposition for chip production. Lam also makes equipment used in the vertical stacking of NAND flash memory modules. These account for roughly half of total sales.\n\nMonday's IBD Stock Of The Day, Five Below, added to Monday's breakout gains, rising another 1.2% Tuesday midday. Shares are in the buy range from a 212.66 buy point in a flat base. The 5% buy area runs up to 223.29.\n\nOn March 15, Philadelphia-based Five Below -- which operates 1,292 teen- and tween-focused discount stores in 42 states -- closed out 2022 with an earnings and revenue beat. Fourth quarter earnings popped 23% to $3.07 per share, ending a three-quarters string of year-over-year declines.\n\nSoftware leader Asure is still in the 5% buy zone above a 14.93 flat-base buy point following Monday's 6.8% breakout rally. Shares tacked on 2% midday Tuesday, near the top of the buy range that tops out at 15.68.\n\nAsure provides web-based workforce management software.\n\nIPO Leader Xponential Fitness is back in buy range past a rare ascending base. The stock initially broke out past the 30.80 entry on April 3, but quickly ran into selling pressure. The buy zone goes up from the buy point to 32.34.

"G7 climate ministers drop language on growing LNG demand in draft Updated On Apr 11, 2023 at 04:21 PM IST\n\nUpdated On Apr 11, 2023 at 04:21 PM IST\n\nBRUSSELS/TOKYO: Climate ministers of the Group of Seven countries have backtracked for now on earlier language touting growing future demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), instead noting there may be ""considerable uncertainty"" for consumption. A previous draft communique for this week\'s meeting of G7 climate change and energy ministers had called for ""necessary upstream investments in LNG and natural gas"" amid the energy fallout from Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine and said ""demand for LNG will continue to grow"". But, as negotiations over the communique resumed on Tuesday ahead of the ministerial meeting on April 15-16 in Sapporo, Japan, the wording was changed, the latest draft reviewed by Reuters showed. ""We recognize that, based on the IEA\'s (International Energy Agency) analyses, there would be considerable uncertainty for future demand of natural gas and LNG and consequently there are risks of supply and demand gap to be addressed,"" the document dated April 5 said. The draft also altered the earlier language on LNG and gas investments to say they would be needed to ""bridge the gap in a manner consistent with our climate objectives and commitments."" It added a line saying, ""Furthermore we will accelerate the clean energy transition through energy savings and gas demand reductions in the process of decarbonization."" It was not clear from the document why the language was changed. But Italy, Germany, France and the European Union had opposed the initial proposal on LNG demand increasing, the draft showed. An official dealing with international affairs at the Japanese industry ministry declined to comment on the draft, saying the negotiations are ongoing. Scientists and analysts have warned that new fossil fuel investments would negate globally agreed climate change goals. Japan plans to keep LNG as a transition fuel for at least 10-15 years, and many Japanese companies are exposed to super-chilled gas projects globally. The document may still change before it is adopted. The latest text showed countries are still at odds over other issues. The EU, the United States and Japan have opposed a proposal by Britain to commit to phase out domestic unabated coal power generation by 2030 and call for the global pipeline of new coal plants to be cancelled, the latest draft showed. Japan wants to start widely co-firing ammonia in its coal-fuelled power plants as a way to reduce CO2 emissions, and is seeking the endorsement of other G7 countries for this plan. The latest draft acknowledged that some countries plan to use ""hydrogen and its derivatives"" - which include ammonia - to cut power sector emissions in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), wording that would be a win for Tokyo.

"Louisville shooting updates: Body camera video shows officers fired at in gunman's 'ambush' LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Body camera video from the first two police officers who responded to the mass shooting at a Louisville bank shows them getting fired at right away in ""an ambush\'\' by the gunman who killed five people Monday.\n\nThe footage, released Tuesday afternoon, also shows the tense moments as officers Corey Galloway and Nickolas Wilt -- both of whom were wounded -- try to ascertain the attacker\'s position as they take gunfire from an AK-15 rifle.\n\nWilt, still in training less than two weeks after graduating from the police academy, was shot in the head and is hospitalized in critical condition after surgery. Other officers who arrived and tried to rescue him came under the gunman\'s barrage too.\n\nLouisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked media members through edited footage and still photos of the attack. One still image from surveillance video showed the shooter, a bank employee identified as Connor Sturgeon, holding a rifle inside the building, surrounded by broken glass.\n\nAfter shooting his co-workers, ""he then went to the front lobby and set up an ambush and waited for officers to respond,\'\' Humphrey said. "" ... As soon as he saw them, he shot at them.\'\'\n\nHumphrey said the officers couldn\'t see the gunman behind glass front doors in the lobby, which was dark. But Sturgeon broke the glass when firing at the officers who came to Wilt\'s aid, giving Galloway a view of his location. Galloway\'s shoulder had been grazed by a bullet, and he found cover behind a large concrete planter.\n\n""Once he is able to see the threat, he then engages the threat, shoots and kills the suspect,\'\' Humphrey said.\n\nSHOOTING WAS LIVESTREAMED:\'An evil act\': Louisville gunman was bank employee. Updates\n\nLatest developments:\n\n 911 tapes are expected to be released later Tuesday. CNN, citing a city official, said Instagram footage shows the rampage lasted about one minute before the shooter sat down in the lobby area and appeared to wait for police.\n\n At least 170 units of blood from the American Red Cross have been used to treat victims of the Old National Bank shooting, medical officials said Tuesday. Greenberg called for members of the Louisville community to donate blood.\n\n Greenberg said a vigil would be held Wednesday at 5 p.m.\n\nTHE KILLER:Who is the Louisville shooter who killed 5 people at bank? What we know about suspect, motive.\n\nThe gunman in a shooting rampage at a bank purchased an AR-15 rifle legally a week ago and used it to ""target"" his victims, the Louisville police chief said Tuesday.\n\nChief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel confirmed the shooter was a bank employee who on April 4 bought at a local gun dealer the weapon used in Monday\'s attack, which left five people dead. The victims were all bank employees, Gwinn-Villaroel said.\n\nMayor Craig Greenberg said he could not confirm reports that the shooter had been fired from his job. However, U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, who spoke at a new conference Tuesday with city officials, said the gunman left a note behind and told at least one person he was suicidal.\n\nVideo from the body cameras of officers who responded to the scene will be released later Tuesday, Gwinn-Villaroel said.\n\nGreenberg urged federal and state lawmakers to give Louisville the ""autonomy to deal with our unique gun violence,"" which he described as an epidemic. Current laws ""are enabling violence and murder,"" Greenberg said.\n\n""The reality is that we have already lost 40 people to gun violence in Louisville this year, including another young man yesterday, just a few blocks away,"" Greenberg said. ""That level of gun violence is beyond horrific.""\n\nWeary and emotional, the chief medical officer at the University of Louisville Hospital pointed out the mass shooting that sent nine people to the facility Monday barely required any adjustments to the operating room schedule. That\'s how frequent incidents of gun violence have become.\n\nJoining city officials at a Tuesday news briefing, Dr. Jason Smith made a plea for action that might help prevent or at least reduce the carnage his staff sees on a regular basis.\n\n""To everyone who helps make policy, state, city, federal, I would simply ask you to do something, because doing nothing, which is what we\'ve been doing, is not working,\'\' Smith said. ""We have to do something, because this is just getting out of hand across our city and across this great nation of ours.""\n\nSmith, who has been at the hospital for more than 15 years, lauded his co-workers but said constantly treating ""these horrific injuries\'\' takes an emotional toll sooner or later.\n\n""There\'s only so many times you can walk into a room and tell someone, \'They\'re not coming home tomorrow,\'"" he said. ""It just breaks your heart when you hear someone screaming, \'Mommy\' or \'Daddy.\' It just becomes too hard, day in and day out, to be able to do that.""\n\nSmith said rookie officer Wilt remained sedated in critical but stable condition Tuesday morning. Wilt, who was shot in the head, graduated from the police academy March 31. Gwinn-Villaroel lauded the actions of Wilt, his training officer and other officers at the scene.\n\n""Just truly proud of the heroic actions of those two officers and everybody else that responded,"" Gwinn-Villaroel said. ""They went forward in order to save and preserve life.""\n\nThe tragedy began Monday morning when an employee opened fire inside a conference room during a morning staff meeting, a manager at the bank said. Rebecca Buchheit-Sims told CNN she was attending the meeting virtually on Monday and watched in horror as the shooting played out ""very quickly"" on her computer screen.\n\n""I witnessed people being murdered,"" she said. ""I don\'t know how else to say that.""\n\nOfficers received reports of shots fired at Old National Bank at 8:38 a.m., and within three minutes of being dispatched they arrived and exchanged gunfire with the attacker, who died at the scene, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Eight people, including two police officers, were wounded in the attack.\n\nGwinn-Villaroel said Sturgeon, 25, was an employee of the bank and was livestreaming while shooting. A SWAT team entered his house Monday afternoon in the Camp Taylor neighborhood in southern Louisville, and police canvassed the neighborhood seeking doorbell camera footage.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile taken down after the shooting, Sturgeon was a summer intern at the bank starting in 2018 and graduated from the University of Alabama, where he earned both bachelor\'s and master\'s degrees by the end of 2020.\n\nSturgeon lived in Louisville but grew up in Indiana. He graduated from Floyd Central High School, where he played basketball. His father, Todd Sturgeon, was head basketball coach at the high school.\n\n– Olivia Krauth, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nThe city\'s downtown was the scene of protests in 2020, after police officers shot and killed Breonna Taylor, helping fuel the national outcry over the deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police. In Louisville, a city of about 633,000 that is home to close-knit communities, Monday\'s shooting once again sparked grief, anger and shock. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who was born in the city, choked back tears as he talked about losing a close friend in the bank carnage.\n\nBarbara Hedspeth, a clinical social worker who attended a vigil for the victims Monday night, said the city\'s connectedness seemed to amplify the pain.\n\n""In Louisville, you\'re one degree (of separation) away from anybody else,"" Hedspeth said. Read more here.\n\nJon High was driving to Against the Grain, a downtown Louisville brewery across the street from the bank, at about 8:50 a.m. Monday. He encountered a crowd running toward him and away from the Old National Bank complex.\n\n""You would\'ve thought Godzilla was coming down the street,"" High said outside the taproom hours later as Beshear spoke at a press conference inside. ""I felt like I was in the middle of something and just didn\'t know what, so that\'s very scary.""\n\nKris King handles marketing for Against the Grain and was heading into work when he was stopped by someone near the business. ""I said, \'I work here, I\'m going to a meeting here. Can I just make a right turn?\' And he was like, \'Well, you can, but there\'s an active shooter with an AR-15,\'"" King said. Read more here.\n\nAll five people killed in the assault were bank employees. Thomas Elliott was a senior vice president of commercial real estate and a friend of Beshear. Juliana Farmer was a loan analyst, and Deana Eckert – who died Monday night at a hospital – was an executive administrator who had worked in banking in Kentucky for 31 years. James Tutt, the commercial real estate market executive for the southern region at the bank, started with the company in January 2015. Josh Barrick was the bank\'s senior vice president of commercial real estate for less than a year.\n\n""Our hearts are heavy, they are broken, and we are searching for answers,"" Barrick\'s pastor, the Rev.

"The Massive 'Batteries' Hidden Beneath Your Feet When rainwater falls, it soaks down into an aquifer, a layer of porous rock or loose materials like sand or gravel. For thousands of years, humans have been digging into these bands of liquid to bring up drinking water. But interest is growing in another clever use for these subterranean pools: aquifer thermal energy storage, or ATES.\n\nA battery holds energy to be used later. Aquifers can be leveraged to do something similar: They can exploit the insulating properties of the Earth to conserve thermal energy and transfer it to and from buildings above ground. The temperature of water in an aquifer tends to stay fairly stable. This provides a way to heat and cool nearby structures with energy stored in water, instead of burning natural gas in furnaces or tapping into fossil-fuel-derived electricity to run air conditioners.\n\nATES systems consist of two separate wells--one warm, one cold--that run between the surface and the aquifer below. In the winter, you pump groundwater up from a warm well that\'s around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and run it through a heat exchanger. Combined with a heat pump, this process extracts heat from the groundwater to keep the structures\' interiors warm.\n\nThen you pump that now-cooler groundwater down into the second well. This gives you a cold pool of water--around 45 degrees F--to pump out of in the summer to chill buildings. ""You heat up the groundwater by taking out the heat from the building and directly inject it into the other well,"" says hydrogeologist Martin Bloemendal, who studies ATES at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. ""Then in winter, you extract from your warm well."" This process alternates indefinitely as the seasons roll on because the groundwater is reused, not consumed. The system could even take advantage of brackish or contaminated aquifers that can\'t be tapped for drinking water. Because the water pumps and other equipment are run on renewable power, like solar or wind, this hyper-efficient energy storage would lower fossil fuel demand and keep a lot of carbon from entering the atmosphere. Heating and cooling are responsible for a third of energy consumption in the US, and half of energy consumption in Europe. In fact, a new paper in the journal Applied Energy found that ATES could reduce the use of natural gas and electricity in heating and cooling US homes and businesses by 40 percent.\n\nIt\'s a way to store massive amounts of energy for long periods of time--an underground battery of sorts, always ready to exploit. ""In a local city, you can store heat, and you can store cold, and now you don\'t have to pay for that later,"" says Erick Burns, the United States Geological Survey\'s leader for the Geothermal Resource Investigations Project. (The USGS is part of a new international consortium that\'s investigating city-scale geothermal energy.) ""The cool thing about it is it doesn\'t need critical minerals, like batteries do.""\n\nThe technique is ideal for large buildings, like hospitals, or a cluster of buildings, like on a college campus, because they can share a dedicated facility for the well and other equipment. It would be particularly effective in times of high demand on the grid. In the US, demand spikes on late summer afternoons when people switch on their energy-hungry AC units. ATES uses far less power, which would lighten the load on the grid and help avoid crashes. If these systems could not only run off solar or wind energy, but be backed up by a distributed network of lithium-ion batteries, they could be resilient against power outages altogether. https://www.wired.com/story/the-massive-batteries-hidden-beneath-your-feet/"
"A Small Town Became the Center of a QAnon Storm. It's Fighting Back Bodegraven is the type of well-heeled Dutch town where young moms push their prams past smart restaurants, people say hello to each other as they pass in the street and packs of children roam around by bicycle. In March, the only sign that something strange has happened here is the insistence of the groundsman in the local graveyard that he cannot speak to passing journalists. Two years ago, this graveyard was overwhelmed with visitors who turned up from out of town to leave flowers and messages of outrage for children buried here, believing they had died at the hands of a satanic pedophile ring involving the prime minister and a Dutch virologist, the Netherlands\' equivalent of Anthony Fauci.\n\nThe conspiracy was a mutation of the QAnon conspiracy, which came out of internet messageboards in the US but has found new life in Europe, piggybacking on local concerns to reach new audiences--with dangerous results. In Germany, 25 people were arrested in December on suspicion of plotting a QAnon-inspired coup to overthrow the country\'s government.\n\nHaving found itself at the center of a new conspiracy, the town of Bodegraven turned to the courts to fight back against unfounded accusations of a satanic cover-up. Yesterday, a court in The Hague sentenced Micha Kat, the country\'s most famous conspiracy theorist and one of the architects of the libel against Bodegraven, to two and a half years in prison for threats and sedition. His sentencing means all three of the people spearheading this Dutch QAnon offshoot have now been jailed.\n\nKat\'s sentencing echoes the case of the US talk show host Alex Jones, who was found liable for defaming the parents of children killed in a massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, after falsely claiming that the mass shooting was a hoax. The hope is that legal proceedings introduce a chilling effect ""in a positive sense,"" says Ciarán O\'Connor, senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate. ""Other conspiracy theorists, who engage in dangerous belief systems that might endanger members of the public, might see this action and think twice about spreading lurid conspiracy theories.""\n\nThe Bodegraven conspiracy centered around claims made by Joost Knevel, who claimed to remember witnessing a satanic pedophile ring operating in the town when he was a child. ""He initially implicated a local doctor, and it was a local story,"" says Sander van der Linden, a professor of psychology at Cambridge University in the UK, who advises governments and companies on how to prevent the spread of misinformation online. But when Knevel teamed up with Kat, a former journalist with a track record of being sued for defamation and making bomb threats, and another conspiracy theorist named Wouter Raatgever, the story morphed to claim that perpetrators also included the country\'s prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the head of the Netherlands\' public health institute, Jaap van Dissel, who was at the time the public face of the country\'s coronavirus response. ""These two other conspiracy theorists helped him craft the narrative in a way that made it really go viral,"" says van der Linden.\n\nThe inclusion of more high-profile figures in the story meant the Bodegraven conspiracy more closely echoed the QAnon template, van der Linden adds. Not only did it play into anti-lockdown sentiments circulating at the time, but the idea of mass child abuse was also shocking enough to attract the attention of even ordinary people--prompting the conspiracy to go viral, he adds. https://www.wired.com/story/qanon-conspiracy-bodegraven-netherlands/"
"A European Space Probe Sets Its Sights on the Jupiter System Jupter\'s frozen moon Europa and a couple of Saturn\'s satellites have gotten lots of love from space probes dispatched by curious Earthlings. Now it\'s Ganymede\'s turn.\n\nGanymede is Jupiter\'s largest moon, and it is thought to be an ""ocean world""--a place with underground water that could be habitable for alien life-forms, despite the cold and its vast distance from the sun. The European Space Agency wants to zoom in on it with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, which is scheduled to launch at 8:15 am Eastern time on April 13 from the agency\'s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. Its ambitious science mission will begin when it arrives at the Jupiter system in 2031. ""We\'ll put Ganymede on the map,"" says project scientist Olivier Witasse. ""We have good reason to believe that underneath the crust of the moon there is a lot of liquid water. That\'s a place where life could start, and that\'s fascinating.""\n\nBut the probe has to get there first. The solar-powered robotic explorer has a long flight to make, and it\'s not a direct one. Since it\'s a fairly heavy spacecraft, it needs gravity assists to reach its destination, Witasse says. It will make an Earth flyby next year, slingshot around Venus in 2025, and make two more Earth flybys after that. Finally, it will have picked up enough speed and be on the right trajectory. That itinerary adds up to an eight-year journey to Jupiter.\n\nThe gas giant, which never became massive enough to ignite fusion reactions in its core like a small star, nevertheless possesses a menagerie of more than 90 moons, making it a mini solar system in its own right. Juice will probe Jupiter\'s trio of icy moons, all thought to be ocean worlds. There\'s Europa, a geologically active moon, which may have volcanic activity underground and oceans just a few miles below the surface. Then there\'s Callisto, a frigid, geologically dead moon in comparison. Ganymede seems to be something in between, but we don\'t know yet, because we\'ve never been there. https://www.wired.com/story/jupiter-ganymede-moon-probe-juice/"
"SC USA Oil Data Index Hits Ultra Bullish Mark In a report sent to Rigzone late last week, analysts at Standard Chartered revealed that the company\'s U.S. oil data bull-bear index rose 29.1 points ""taking it to an ultra-bullish  98.4"".\n\n""After months of providing remorselessly weak signals about the health of the U.S. economy and the global oil market, the weekly Energy Information Administration (EIA) data is now sending significantly more positive messages,"" the analysts noted in the report.\n\n""This is the second-strongest reading on record. It is the second consecutive ultra-bullish reading; the average across the two weeks is the highest on record,"" the analysts added.\n\nIn the report, the Standard Chartered analysts highlighted that inventories fell against the five-year average in all categories except jet fuel, ""with large draws against the average in crude oil (7.08 million barrels of which 3.21 million barrels was at Cushing), gasoline (6.04 million barrels) and distillates (3.88 million barrels)"".\n\n""Gasoline inventories are now particularly tight; they are at an eight-year low for March and just 2.39 million barrels above the seven-year low for any week in H1,"" the analysts added.\n\nThe analysts noted in the report that U.S. commercial inventories reached a peak deficit to the five-year average of 151.7 million barrels at the start of June 2022, ""coincident with the peak in prices"". The deficit was filled by mid-February this year after which a surplus grew, peaking at 34.7 million barrels three weeks ago, the analysts said in the report.\n\n""The surplus shrank in the latest release to just 1.6 million barrels, and the U.S. market now appears to be on the brink of tipping back into deficit,"" the analysts stated.\n\nStandard Chartered analysts also highlighted in the report that the demand element of the data was stronger.\n\n""The four-week average of the demand bull-bear sub-index became positive for the first time since mid-April 2022 , helped by YTD gains in gasoline and jet fuel but held back by distillates,"" they said.\n\n""The improvement in the data and the likely contraction in global inventories over coming months should eventually support an improvement in oil market sentiment; however, for the moment the tone among hedge funds in particular seems to have remained stubbornly downbeat,"" the analysts added.\n\nIn a separate report sent to Rigzone on March 31, analysts at Standard Chartered outlined that distillate demand was ""perhaps the only weak feature"" of the latest Energy Information Administration release at the time, adding that the rest was ""extremely strong"".\n\n""Our U.S. oil data bull-bear index increased 66.5 week on week to an ultra-bullish  79.8; only one release has been stronger in the past 18 months,"" the analysts stated in that report.\n\n""Crude inventories fell by 10.28 million barrels relative to the five-year average, product inventories fell by 4.45 million barrels against the five-year average,"" the analysts added.\n\nBullish Capital Flows\n\nIn an oil report sent to Rigzone on Monday, analysts at Macquarie Bank Limited noted that they expect ""bullish capital flows to continue for the time being as the [OPEC ] production cuts will drive storage draws given current market expectations for demand, which have largely remained intact despite global recession concerns"".\n\nThe analysts warned in the report that they expect the market\'s expectations for large draws in the second half of the year will moderate ""due to (1) NOPEC supply response, (2) demand disappointment, and (3) OPEC  deal compliance challenges"".\n\n""Following last week\'s OPEC  announcement, both WTI and Brent prices have increased by approximately $5 per barrel, suggesting the market is expecting 50 percent compliance,"" the analysts said in the report.\n\n""The rule of thumb is $1 per 100,000 barrel per day loss of crude supply,"" they added.\n\nIn the report, the Macquarie analysts said WTI and Brent both built speculative net length, highlighting that WTI rose by 39K and Brent rose by 68K.\n\n""Notably, money managers increased their bullish bets on ICE Brent resulting in the highest number of longs in the last three weeks and the smallest number of shorts seen in the last month,"" the analysts said in the report.\n\n""WTI Brent speculative net length increased by 107.1K contracts to 282.7K; shorts decreased by 55.9K, while longs increased 51.3K.

Brent Other net short grew by 12.4K contracts to -264.9K; shorts grew by 6.8K, while longs fell 5.6K,"" they continued.\n\nIn a separate Macquarie report sent to Rigzone on April 6, analysts at the company noted that they were ""relatively less bearish than before the [OPEC ] cut"" but added that they remained cautious about ""overly bullish sentiment"".\n\n""Our caution is driven by risks related to unusually large deal slippage potential, an ongoing large global supply response, and the potential that demand disappointments versus currently optimistic expectations,"" the analysts stated in that report.\n\n""Bulls correctly note that OPEC cuts are a key geopolitical factor that should always be imbedded into S-D balances. While we agree, we also think that correctly interpreting the cuts is important,"" the analysts added.\n\n""We believe that OPEC, through its vast window into global markets, was seeing large, YTD and Bal 2023 surpluses,"" they went on to state.\n\nIn an extraordinary market note sent to Rigzone earlier this month, Rystad Energy Senior Vice President Jorge Leon highlighted that the OPEC  supply cuts are scheduled to start from May, ""which coincides with the refinery pre-summer season ramp up and an anticipated refined products demand rebound"".\n\n""Saudi Arabia will shoulder most of the cuts, reducing production by 500,000 barrels per day,"" Leon said in the market note.\n\n""Other participants are the UAE (144,000 bpd), Kuwait (128,000 bpd), Iraq (211,000 bpd), Oman (40,000 bpd), Algeria (48,000 bpd) and Kazakhstan (78,000 bpd), according to statements from their respective governments,"" he added.\n\n""Russia also announced that the existing 500,000 bpd production cut, initially from March to June, will be extended till the end of the year,"" Leon continued.\n\nThe Rystad Senior Vice President highlighted in the note that the voluntary reductions are in addition to the current official OPEC  cuts of two million barrels per day announced back in October 2022.\n\n""The fact that all these countries are adhering to the current OPEC  quotas, with compliance levels at close to 100 percent, implies that the announced voluntary cuts will also most likely be real,"" Leon stated in the note.\n\nTo contact the author, email andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com https://www.rigzone.com/news/sc_usa_oil_data_index_hits_ultra_bullish_mark-12-apr-2023-172506-article/?rss=true"
"Russia's Flagship Oil Moving Closer to $60 Cap The price of Russian oil is nearing a threshold that could create complications for the country's biggest buyers.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations last year imposed a cap of $60 a barrel on crude shipped from Russia to limit the Kremlin's profits amid the war in Ukraine. Buyers who pay above that level lose access to industry-standard insurance under the sanctions.\n\nThe price of Russia's flagship Urals crude at the point of export is getting closer to the $60 limit, data from Argus Media Ltd. show. The delivered price of the grade to India's west coast -- including shipping costs -- was actually more than $73 a barrel as of April 6.\n\nIt's getting increasingly difficult to assess the actual price of Russian crude, due to the emergence of a shadow fleet of vessels and trading companies with unclear affiliations. However, oil prices soared following last week's shock announcement by OPEC  to cut output, and global demand is expected to increase later this year, adding further upward pressure.\n\nFor much of the past year, Russian oil exports have surged, with much of it going to India and China. But increasingly tighter sanctions are starting to bite, and Russia has pledged to cut output through the end of the year. The country's seaborne exports just saw their biggest weekly drop since December, tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nA gap of about $18 a barrel exists between the point of shipping and delivery of Urals cargoes in Argus's data. The Russian grade shipped from the Baltic port Primorsk and Novorossiysk on the Black Sea costs about $55 a barrel.\n\nThe delivered price of Russian oil to India averaged $72.14 a barrel in February, the most recent month for available data, according to the South Asian nation's ministry of commerce and industry. That's marginally lower than in January.\n\nWhile Russian crude is getting pricier, there are signs that it's still cheap enough to undercut other suppliers. The cost of Iraqi crude to India dropped to an average of $76.19 a barrel in February, compared with $78.92 in January, according to India's ministry.\n\n--With assistance from Jack Wittels and Rakesh Sharma. https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/russias_flagship_oil_moving_closer_to_60_cap-12-apr-2023-172507-article/?rss=true"
"Does H.R.1 Bill Have Any Chance of Becoming Law? The legislation as a whole will not become law this Congress.\n\nThat\'s according to Kenny Stein, the Director of Policy for the Institute of Energy Research (IER), who noted that Senate Democrats have said they are opposed and that President Biden has promised to veto.\n\nThere are components of the legislation that may end up passing as part of bipartisan negotiations, however, Stein told Rigzone.\n\n""The two sections most likely to figure into those discussions are the permitting language, where there is pretty broad bipartisan agreement that some sort of permitting reform is needed, and the critical minerals/mining language, where again there is some bipartisan support for increasing domestic production of those minerals,"" Stein said.\n\n""The language in H.R.1 could form the basis or opening ante for negotiations,"" he added.\n\nLonger term, Stein said there is a better likelihood that much, or substantially all, of H.R. 1 may pass in the future under the next Republican president.\n\n""Having discussed and negotiated this agreement among Republicans now, when the next president is looking for ideas for energy legislation, this is something that will be ready on the shelf,"" Stein said.\n\nThe H.R.1 bill passed the House of Representatives on March 30 with 225 Yeas to 204 Nays after being introduced to the House on March 14, the Congress website shows. It still needs to pass the senate and go to the president to become law, the site outlines.\n\nThe bill expedites the development, importation, and exportation of energy resources, including by waiving environmental review requirements and other specified requirements under certain environmental laws, eliminating certain restrictions on the import and export of oil and natural gas, and prohibiting the President from declaring a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing, a summary of H.R.1 posted on the Congress site states.\n\nRepublican Candidates\n\nA Quinnipiac University national poll published on March 29 revealed that, from a list of 15 Republicans who have either declared a 2024 presidential run or are seen as potential candidates, Donald Trump received 47 percent support among Republican and Republican leaning voters, followed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who received 33 percent.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence received five percent and former United Nations Ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley received four percent, according to the poll, which outlined that, out of the remaining 11 listed declared or potential candidates, no one topped two percent.\n\nThe results are largely unchanged from a Quinnipiac University poll on March 15, the poll\'s website highlighted.\n\nIn a head to head between Trump and DeSantis, Trump received 52 percent support and DeSantis received 42 percent support, the Quinnipiac University poll showed, adding that this was ""essentially unchanged from earlier in the month"".\n\nIER describes itself as a not for profit organization that conducts intensive research and analysis on the functions, operations, and government regulation of global energy markets. The organization notes on its site that it ""maintains that freely-functioning energy markets provide the most efficient and effective solutions to today\'s global energy and environmental challenges and, as such, are critical to the well-being of individuals and society"".\n\nAccording to its website, the Quinnipiac University Poll is a nationally recognized leader in public opinion research ""taking the pulse of American voters, on a continual basis, across the country regarding key public policy issues and elections"".\n\nTo see reaction to the H.R.1 bill\'s passage through the House from energy groups including the American Petroleum Institute (API), the Energy Workforce & Technology Council (EWTC), and the American Exploration and Production Council (AXPC), click here.\n\nTo contact the author, email andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com https://www.rigzone.com/news/does_hr1_bill_have_any_chance_of_becoming_law-12-apr-2023-172509-article/?rss=true"
"China Invests in Qatar LNG Plant  Sinopec has bought into a liquefied natural gas project in Qatar in a bid to bolster the energy security of China, the world\'s second-largest buyer of the fuel.\n\nAt a signing ceremony in Doha, Sinopec -- officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. -- agreed to take a 5% stake in a train with a processing capacity of 8 million tons a year. It\'s part of the North Field East LNG export project that\'s under construction and is expected to begin shipping gas in 2026.\n\nCooperation with QatarEnergy will help ""optimize China\'s energy consumption structure and enhance the security, stability and reliability of clean energy supply,"" Sinopec Chairman Ma Yongshen said at the event on Wednesday.\n\nThe investment marks the first time China has directly backed an LNG plant in Qatar, one of the world\'s top exporters.

Japan is currently the world\'s primary buyer of LNG.\n\nIn November, state-owned Sinopec signed a $60 billion contract to buy 4 million tons of LNG a year. The deal will last for 27 years, making it China\'s longest LNG supply agreement to date, according to data from BNEF.\n\nMa said Wednesday that he hopes Sinopec will continue to explore new LNG cooperation opportunities with QatarEnergy. Qatar is the second-largest supplier of the fuel to China, after Australia.\n\nSinopec is better-known for its oil refining operations than its upstream prowess, as the company typically leaves drilling activities to its sister firms, China National Petroleum Corp. and China National Offshore Oil Corp. Still, Sinopec owns a 25% stake in the Australia Pacific LNG export plant on Curtis Island.\n\nSeveral European states have attempted to secure more LNG from Qatar, as Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted gas flows to the continent for much of the past year. However, their reluctance to sign long-term contracts and agree to fixed -destination clauses has stymied negotiations with the Middle Eastern country.\n\nQatarEnergy is ""prioritizing long-term strategic partners from China,"" Chief Executive Officer Saad Al-Kaabi said Wednesday.\n\nConocoPhillips, Shell Plc, TotalEnergies SE, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Eni SpA are also investors in North Field East, which will increase Qatar\'s LNG export capacity to 110 million tons a year from 77 million tons.\n\n--With assistance from Verity Ratcliffe, Dan Murtaugh and Kathy Chen. https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/china_invests_in_qatar_lng_plant-12-apr-2023-172512-article/?rss=true"

"Gen Z isn't letting the economy keep them from living their most luxurious lives. They're just buying stuff secondhand instead. A record number of Gen Z is living at home and fueling a luxury boom.\n\nAnd even increasing economic uncertainty is not deterring their pursuit of the good life -- they\'re just buying secondhand instead.\n\nAbout 30% of Gen Z -- those born between 1997 and 2012 -- are buying secondhand items to afford higher-end brands, according to an April 5 resale report by ThredUp, an online thrift store and resale platform. ThredUp used data derived from a GlobalData survey of 3,012 American adults in December.\n\nAnd it\'s not just Gen Z: Americans bought about 1.4 billion pieces of secondhand apparel last year that they would have ordinarily bought new, marking a 40% increase over 2021, the report says.\n\nThe most popular brands in resale include cult athleisure company Lululemon, luxury American fashion house Coach, and fashion brand Kate Spade New York, per the report.\n\nTwo in five items in Gen Z\'s closets were previously owned by someone else, per the report.\n\nMoreover, 64% of the surveyed members of Gen Z look for an item secondhand before buying it new, up four percentage points from 2021, per ThredUp\'s report.\n\nPersistent high inflation and fears of an economic slowdown are the primary drivers of these changing preferences, the report stated. On March 22, the US Federal Reserve hiked interest rates for a ninth consecutive time in its continued drive to cool inflation.\n\nBut ""value is the number 1 driver influencing purchasing decisions,"" the report said.\n\nWhile reporting about 20-somethings who live at home and splash out on cars and designer handbags, Insider\'s Dan Latu and Kelsey Neubauer spoke to Anastasia Ricci, a 25-year-old public-relations associate account executive who lives at home.

"Warren Buffett gives reason for surprise sale of stake in Taiwan's TSMC Warren Buffett says geopolitical tensions were ""a consideration"" in the decision to sell most of Berkshire Hathaway\'s shares in global chip giant TSMC, which is based in Taiwan.\n\nThe 92-year-old ""Oracle of Omaha"" shed light on the investment call in a Tuesday interview with Japanese news agency Nikkei. He was quoted as sayiing that TSMC was a well-managed company but that Berkshire had ""better places"" to deploy its capital.\n\nIn February, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) revealed that it had sold 86% of its shares in TSMC, which were purchased for $4.1 billion just months before.\n\nThe quick sale was considered unusual because the billionaire is known for making longer term bets. The size of the purchase suggested that the initial purchase was most likely made personally by Buffett himself, rather than one of his portfolio managers, Reuters reported.\n\nTSMC is considered a national treasure in Taiwan and supplies semiconductors to tech giants including Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM). It mass produces the most advanced semiconductors in the world, components that are vital to the smooth running of everything from smartphones to washing machines.\n\nThe company is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy, as well as to China -- which claims Taiwan as its own territory despite having never controlled it -- that it is sometimes even referred to as forming part of a ""silicon shield"" against a potential military invasion by Beijing.\n\nTSMC\'s presence is seen as providing a strong incentive to the West to defend Taiwan against any attempt by China to take it by force.\n\nThis week, tensions soared across the Taiwan Strait after China simulated ""joint precision strikes"" on the island during a series of military exercises.\n\nBeijing launched the drills on Saturday, a day after Taiwan\'s President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a 10-day visit to Central America and the United States where she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nChinese officials described the drills as ""a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces\' collusion with external forces, and a necessary move to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.""\n\nBeijing conducted similar large-scale military exercises around Taiwan last August, after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island.\n\nTaiwan and China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago, in which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/taiwan-buffett-tsmc-sale-hnk-intl/index.html"

"A Texas County that was ordered to return banned books to its shelves is set to consider shutting down its library system A rural Texas county that was ordered by a federal judge to return banned books to its public library shelves is now considering shutting down its libraries entirely.\n\nA meeting of the Commissioners Court of Llano County on Thursday will include discussion of whether to ""continue or cease operations of the current physical Llano County library system pending further guidance from the Federal Courts,"" according to the meeting agenda.\n\nThe meeting comes after federal Judge Robert Pitman on March 30 ordered the Llano County Library System – which includes three branches – to return 12 children\'s books to its shelves that had been removed, many because of their LGBTQ and racial content.\n\nBooks ordered to return to shelves included ""Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents"" by Isabel Wilkerson, ""They Called Themselves the K.K.K.: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group"" by Susan Campbell Bartoletti and ""Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen"" by Jazz Jennings.\n\nSeven residents had sued county officials in April 2022, claiming their First and 14th Amendment rights were violated when books deemed inappropriate by some people in the community and Republican lawmakers were removed from public libraries or access was restricted.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the county commissioners kicked out the members of the library board in 2021 and replaced them with a new board that demanded review of the content of all its books. That led to several books being removed from its catalog access being cut off to an e-book service that included some of the disputed titles.\n\nThe defendants argued the books were removed as part of a regular ""weeding"" process following the library\'s existing policies.\n\nThe judge later gave the library system 24 hours to place the books back onto shelves, saying ""the First Amendment prohibits the removal of books from libraries based on either viewpoint or content discrimination.""\n\nThe Commissioners Court agenda item for the upcoming meeting does not include a reason for the possible closure of the library. What it does say is that the discussion is ""regarding the continued employment and/or status of the Llano County Library System employees and the feasibility of the use of the library premises by the public.""\n\n""It appears that the defendants would rather shut down the Library System entirely -- depriving thousands of Llano county residents of access to books, learning resources, and meeting space -- than make the banned books available to residents who want to read them,"" Ellen Leonida, the attorney for plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe Llano County commissioners and members of the Library Board have appealed the judge\'s ruling. They did not respond to CNN\'s request for comment.\n\nThe next hearing in the case is set for April 27 to consider possible sanctions against the defendants for failing to appear for depositions in the case.\n\nThe case comes amid ongoing fights across the country to protect access to books in response to a banning boom that has taken shape in the US – including in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries.\n\nIn 2022, the number of attempts to censor library books reached an unparalleled record high since the American Library Association began documenting data about book censorship over 20 years ago, the organization said in March.\n\nIt cataloged 1,269 demands to censor library books in 2022 – nearly double the number of challenges in 2021.\n\nCNN\'s Alaa Elassar and Taylor Romine contributed to this report. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/us/texas-llano-county-library-banned-books/index.html"
"Prohibition of AI that &#39;subverts state power&#39; in China may chill its nascent industry Chinese regulators have proposed restrictive rules around AI models like ChatGPT being built in the country, requiring user identification and security reviews, and prohibiting ""any content that subverts state power, advocates the overthrow of the socialist system, incites splitting the country or undermines national unity.""\n\nThe rules come hot on the heels of Chinese tech companies rolling out their versions of general purpose large language models, versatile AI systems that can converse in natural language and carry out a surprising number of tasks. While the reception of SenseTime, Baidu, and Alibaba\'s models over the last month suggests they\'re somewhat behind the likes of GPT-4, it\'s clear the industry there is equally dedicated to developing these capabilities.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after the debut of Alibaba\'s Tongyi Qianwen model, one of the country\'s tech regulators, the Cyberspace Administration of China, proposed restrictions that may smother relevant innovations -- and the Chinese AI industry\'s ambitions along with them.\n\nThe draft rules are not available in English (I took the above quote from the Financial Times translation syndicated at Ars Technica) but can be viewed at the regulator\'s website here. The first part of article 4 prohibits generative AI that subverts government power and authority or questions national unity, along with various other categories of prohibitions like ethnic discrimination, terrorism, and so on.\n\nThis kind of catch-all morality clause is commonplace in China, but it happens to be the kind of restriction that generative AI is uniquely incapable of complying with. Even the most carefully trained and tuned LLM seems to be capable of being tricked into saying all manner of objectionable things. Whether Chinese censors decide this is in compliance with the law or not is more or less entirely up to them, something that makes the prospect of dedicating serious resources to such a project somewhat fraught.\n\nOf course, much of Chinese industry exists under a similarly suspended dagger, and although China\'s regulators are capricious, they are not foolish enough to throw away the fruits of the government\'s years of propping up R&D in the country. It\'s probable that, not unlike other content-limiting laws there, this will act more as a fig leaf and ironclad excuse for the government to exert influence -- not a blanket prohibition.\n\nIf anything, it is the other requirements that may slow AI development there to a crawl.\n\nThe CAC draft rules require, among other things, that providers assume liability and responsibility for the training data of models, including difficult to measure metrics like authenticity, objectivity, and diversity; users of the services must be verified as real people; personal information and reputation must be respected or regulators may find the provider liable; generated content must be labeled as such; and many other restrictions.\n\nCertainly some of these requirements could be considered prudent or even critical to a responsible AI industry, but the truth is many of them would be incredibly difficult, perhaps impossible to implement by today\'s companies and R&D efforts. OpenAI has achieved its success partly because it is working in an almost complete regulatory vacuum. If the law required that the company, say, obtain permission from the rights holders of the text and media it used to train its models, it would probably still be waiting to build GPT-2.\n\nIf an AI startup or even an established company can\'t confidently operate in China for fear of violating these rules at a massive scale, they may decide that their resources are better spent elsewhere. As fast-moving as this industry is, such a setback may be very difficult to regain.\n\nThe Financial Times quoted Alibaba\'s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, as saying that ""10 to 20 years from now, when we look back, we will realize we were all on the same starting line."" That is almost certainly true, and from a similar perspective we may well see how regulation throttled innovation -- or perhaps how it prevented a stagnating monopoly, or protected people from the well-organized mass theft of their data.\n\nThe draft rules are open for comment (by parties in China, obviously) for the next month, after which they may or may not be revised, and are slated to enter effect later this year. https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/11/prohibition-of-ai-that-subverts-state-power-in-china-may-chill-its-nascent-industry/"

"Amazon creates a new user-centric simulation platform to develop embodied AI agents AI-powered robots are generally trained in simulation environments before they are tested and introduced in real-world settings. These environments allow developers to safely test their machine learning techniques on a variety of robots and in numerous possible scenarios, without having to purchase hardware, assemble robots and then bring them to remote locations, or compromise on real-world safety of the deployed systems.\n\nAmazon Alexa AI recently created a new simulation platform specifically for embodied AI research, the field specialized in the development of autonomous robots. This platform, dubbed Alexa Arena, was presented in a paper pre-published on arXiv and is publicly available on GitHub.\n\n""Our primary objective was to develop an interactive Embodied AI framework to catalyze the creation of next-generation embodied AI agents,"" Govind Thattai, the lead scientist for Arena platform, told Tech Xplore. ""Several embodied-AI simulation platforms have been proposed in recent years (e.g., AI2Thor, Habitat, iGibson). These platforms support simulated scenes, where embodied agents can navigate and interact with objects, yet most of them are not designed for humans to interact with agents due to the lack of user-centricity,"" said Qiaozi Gao, who co-developed the Arena framework.\n\nAs most available simulation platforms are not user-centric to collect data for human-robot interactions, developers often need to conduct real-world experiments, which is typically expensive and time consuming. Alternatively, some teams choose to develop a so-called ""inferencing engine,"" a computational tool that allows humans to directly interact with a simulated environment, yet this also requires time and additional research efforts.\n\nEmbodied agents need to consistently interact with their environments, while also learning from and adapting to other agents or humans in a safe and effective manner. While current simulation platforms focus on task decomposition and navigation, Arena attempts to fill in the missing pieces that would inevitably come into play during deployment and real-time evaluation of collaborative robots.\n\nArena is augmented with user-centric features to not only bolster development and evaluation of EAI agents, but also to bridge the gap between the development and deployment phase. This is done by making humans an indispensable part of the EAI development and evaluation process.\n\n""To address these challenges, we created Alexa Arena,"" said Suhaila Shakiah, a developer of Arena ML components. ""Our platform offers a framework with user-centric capabilities, such as smooth visuals during robot navigation, continuous background animations and sounds, viewpoints in rooms to simplify room-2-room navigation, and visual hints embedded in the scene that aid human-users to generate suitable instructions for task-completion. These features enhance usability and user experience, enabling human-in-the-loop embodied AI development and evaluation.""\n\nOn the Alexa Arena platform, developers can develop and test different embodied AI agents with multimodal capabilities. These agents can interact with the relevant objects or areas in the simulated environment based on the specific requests by users, a capability known as visual grounding. They can also learn to follow natural language user instructions, which is a vital aspect of human-robot interaction.\n\n""Alexa Arena pushes the boundaries of human-robot interaction,"" explained Xiaofeng Gao, an Arena developer. ""It offers an interactive, user-centric framework, enabling creating robotic tasks and missions that involve navigating multi-room simulated environments and real time object manipulation. In a game-like setting, users can interact with virtual robots through natural-language dialogue, providing invaluable feedback and helping the robots learn and complete their tasks.""\n\nIn contrast with other existing simulation platforms, Alexa Arena has a greatly simplified interface for developers and end-users alike. Users can create specific tasks and missions for the robots in the simulation environment using in-built hints, and features that push the boundaries of human-computer interaction and embodied AI. This also helps to collect human-robot interaction data more easily and efficiently, while also training robots to effectively tackle interactive tasks using a variety of different objects and tools.\n\nThe user-centric platform could soon be used by developers and researchers worldwide to develop highly performing embodied AI agents and smart robots. Meanwhile, the team plans to further enhance Alexa Arena, adding new features and simulated scenarios.\n\n""We will now continue to improve the Arena platform to support higher and better runtime performances, more scenes, a richer collection of objects and a wider range of interactions,"" Govind added. ""We will also continue investing in the general Embodied AI field, by developing next-generation intelligent robots that can complete real-world tasks and engage in natural communication with humans.""\n\nMore information: Qiaozi Gao et al, Alexa Arena: A User-Centric Interactive Platform for Embodied AI, arXiv (2023).

"Unlocking the Power of the AMD GPU: Setting up TensorFlow-DirectML It allows the use of the DirectML API for GPU acceleration in TensorFlow models on any GPU that supports the Direct3D 12 API, including both Nvidia and AMD GPUs, without the need for specific GPU drivers or libraries.\n\nIt's a project by Microsoft that enables the use of DirectML API for GPU acceleration in TensorFlow models, making it easier than ever to take advantage of the power of the GPU. In this article, I'll walk you through the process of setting up an Anaconda environment for TensorFlow-DirectML and running tests to verify that DirectML and the GPU are being used for machine learning computations. With this guide, you'll be able to overcome the struggles of setting up TensorFlow to run with GPUs and unlock the full potential of your machine learning models.\n\nDirectML is designed to be hardware-agnostic and can work with any GPU that supports the Direct3D 12 API, including both Nvidia and AMD GPUs. Check more on the hardware requirements here if you are facing troubles.\n\nThis means that you can use DirectML with a wide range of GPUs, regardless of the manufacturer. However, it's worth noting that different GPUs may have different levels of performance when it comes to machine learning computations, so it's important to choose the right GPU for your specific use case.\n\nIn addition, it's important to ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date and that your system meets the requirements for using DirectML. For example, DirectML requires a system with Windows 10 and a GPU that supports DirectX 12 with feature level 12_0 or higher.\n\nTraditionally, machine learning computations are performed on CPUs, which are general-purpose processors that are designed to handle a wide range of tasks. While CPUs are powerful, they are not optimized for machine learning computations. On the other hand, GPUs are specialized processors that are designed to handle large amounts of data in parallel. This makes them ideal for machine learning computations, which involve large matrices and tensor operations. https://python.plainenglish.io/unlocking-the-power-of-the-amd-gpu-setting-up-tensorflow-directml-b56faa3c5559?gi=ab83fc9c1d39"
"Alibaba Has Launched Its ChatGPT Competitor Alibaba's announcement of its new AI-powered service, Tongyi Qianwen, is a significant development in the increasingly competitive large language model space. The Chinese multinational conglomerate, which specializes in e-commerce, retail, internet, and technology, plans to eventually roll out the new software across all its platforms.\n\nTongyi Qianwen is a large language model that generates compelling responses to user prompts. The technology was trained on vast troves of data and is designed to be integrated into Alibaba's Tmall Genie smart speakers and workplace messaging platform DingTalk initially. However, the company has plans to add the technology to all its applications, including e-commerce and mapping services.\n\nThe new AI-powered service was presented by Group CEO Daniel Zhang at a conference in Beijing, where he demonstrated how it can be used to transcribe meeting notes, craft business pitches, and tell children's stories. The company has opened up Tongyi Qianwen for testing to enterprise customers before making it available to more users.\n\nAlibaba, which has a large cloud computing business, has announced that it will allow its cloud clients to use the new technology to build their own customized large language models. This is a significant development for businesses that want to create unique, customized AI models to meet their specific needs.\n\nThe debut of Tongyi Qianwen comes after Baidu, another Chinese tech giant, launched its own ChatGPT-style service last month. During a similar presentation, Baidu showcased how its chatbot, called ERNIE, could generate a company newsletter, come up with a corporate slogan, and solve a math riddle.\n\nChinese AI companies are racing to release their versions of large language models, and Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen is a major player in the space. SenseTime, one of China's most prominent AI companies, also launched a suite of new services, including a chatbot called SenseChat, on Monday.\n\nHowever, with the growing popularity of large language models, China's cyberspace regulator has issued draft guidelines that require generative AI services to undergo security reviews before they can operate. Service providers will also be required to verify users' real identities and provide information about the scale and type of data they use, their basic algorithms, and other technical information. These regulations are an attempt to regulate the use of AI-powered services and protect user privacy.\n\nAlibaba's shares in Hong Kong ticked up 1.6% following its demonstration of Tongyi Qianwen. The company announced last month that it planned to split its business into six units, with most of those units, including its cloud services business that oversees AI projects, authorized to raise capital and pursue public listings. This move is expected to give Alibaba greater flexibility to focus on its core businesses and expand its reach into new markets.\n\nMore content at PlainEnglish.io.\n\nSign up for our free weekly newsletter.

"Can healthcare show the way forward for scaling AI? This article is part of a VB Lab Insights series on AI sponsored by Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nDon\'t miss additional articles in this series providing new industry insights, trends and analysis on how AI is transforming organizations. Find them all here\n\nScaling artificial intelligence (AI) is tough in any industry. And healthcare ranks among the toughest, thanks to highly complex applications, scattered stakeholder networks, stringent licensing and regulations, data privacy and security -- and the life-and-death nature of the industry.\n\n""If you mis-forecast an inventory level because your AI doesn\'t work, that\'s not great, but you\'ll recover,"" says Peter Durlach, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of Nuance Communications, a conversational AI company specializing in healthcare. ""If your clinical AI makes a mistake, like missing a cancerous nodule on an X-ray, that can have more serious consequences.""\n\nEven with the current willingness of many organizations to fund AI initiatives, many healthcare organizations lack the skilled staff, technical know-how and bandwidth to deploy and scale AI into clinical workflows. In fact, it\'s far lower than the average of around 54% for all industries combined.\n\nDespite the difficulties, machine learning (ML) and other forms of AI have impacted a wide range of clinical domains and use cases in hospitals, R&D centers, laboratories and diagnostic centers. In particular, deep learning and computer vision have helped improve accuracy, accelerate interpretation and reduce repetition for radiologists for x-ray, CT, MR, 3D ultrasound and other imaging. With global shortages of radiologists and physicians looming, AI assistance could be a ""game-changer.""\n\nAfter slow growth that has trailed nearly every industry, many analysts forecast that healthcare AI will boom in 2023 and beyond. The global market is expected to exceed $187 billion by 2030, reflecting fast-growing demand.\n\nTo take advantage of investments, enterprises and industry vendors must overcome several technical obstacles to adoption of clinical AI. Chief among them: Lack of standardized, healthcare-specific platforms and integrated development and run-time environments (IDEs and RTEs).\n\nMoreover, current infrastructure often lacks the functionality, workflows and governance to easily create, validate, deploy, monitor and scale -- up, down and out. That makes it difficult to scale up during a morning clinic, then scale down during the evening when demand is lower, for example. Or to easily expand deployment of AI systems and models across organizations.\n\nYet despite (and perhaps because of) these challenges, some of today\'s most innovative and effective approaches for moving AI into production come from healthcare.\n\nWhat follows are conversations VB had separately with two global leaders about leading-edge, cloud-based approaches that might offer blueprints for other industries struggling with scaling automation.\n\nAccelerating creation and deployment of trained models at scale with a secure cloud network service -- a conversation with Peter Durlach, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer at Nuance.\n\nGood news: The growing popularity of foundation and large language approaches is making it easier to create AI models, says Durlach. But the difficulty of deploying and scaling AI models and applications into healthcare workflows models continues to present a formidable challenge.\n\n""About 95% of all models built in-house or by commercial vendors never get deployed, because getting them into clinical workflow is impossible,"" Durlach said. ""If I\'m a client building a model just for myself, it\'s one set of challenges to get that deployed in my own company. But if I\'m a commercial vendor trying to deploy across multiple settings, it\'s a nightmare to integrate from the outside.""\n\nMaking it easier for hospitals, AI developers and others to overcome these obstacles is the goal of a new partnership between Nuance, Nvidia and Microsoft. The aim is to simplify and speed the translation of trained AI imaging models into deployable clinical applications at scale by combining the nationwide Nuance Precision Imaging Network, an AI-powered Azure cloud platform, and MONAI, an open-source and domain-specialized medical-imaging AI framework cofounded and accelerated by Nvidia.\n\nThe latest solution builds on two decades of work by Burlington, Mass.-based Nuance to deploy AI applications at scale. ""We are a commercial AI company,"" Durlach explains. ""If it doesn\'t scale, it has no value."" In these interview highlights, he explains the value of an AI development and deployment service and suggests what to look for in a provider of AI delivery networks and cloud infrastructure.\n\n""People underestimate the complexity of closing the gap from development to deployment to where people actually use the AI application. They think, I put a website up, I have my model, I have a mobile app. Not so much. The activities involved in implementing an AI stretch from R&D through deployment to after-market monitoring and maintenance. In life science, they talk about getting a clinical invention from the bench to the bedside. This is a similar problem.""\n\nKey steps in developing and using AI for medical imaging\n\n""If I\'m a healthcare organization, I want to use AI to drive very specific outcomes. I don\'t want to have to build anything. I just want to deploy an application that solves a specific business problem. Nuance is bringing end-to-end development, from low-level infrastructure and AI tools all the way up to specific deployable applications, so you don\'t have to stitch components together or build anything on top.\n\n""The Nuance Precision Imaging Network runs on Azure and is accessible across more than 12,000 connected facilities across the country. A health system or a commercial vendor can deploy from development to runtime with a single click and be already integrated with 80% percent of the infrastructure in U.S. hospital systems today.\n\nThe new partnership with Nvidia brings specialized ML development frameworks for medical imaging into clinical translation workflows for the first time, which really accelerates innovation and clinical impact. Mass General Brigham is one of the first major medical centers to use the new offering. They\'re defining a unique workflow that links medical-imaging model development, application packaging, deployment and clinical feedback for model refinement.""\n\n""When Nuance was looking for cloud and AI in healthcare, one of the first things we asked was What\'s the company\'s stance on data security and privacy? What are they going to do with the data? The large cloud companies are all great. But if you look closely, there are many questions about what\'s going to happen to the data. One\'s core business is monetizing data in various ways. Another one often uses data to go up the stack and compete with their partners and clients.\n\n""On the technical side, each cloud company has their strengths and weaknesses. If you look at the breadth of the infrastructure, Microsoft is basically a developer platform company that provides tools and resources to third parties to build solutions on top of. They\'re not a search company. They\'re not a pure infrastructure company or a retail company. For us, they have a whole set of tools -- Azure, Azure ML, a bunch of governance models -- and all the development environments around .NET, Visual Studio, and all these things that make it easier, not trivial, to build and deploy AI products. Once you\'re running, you need to look closely at scalability, reliability and global footprint.\n\n""For data security, privacy and comfort with the business model, Microsoft stood out for us. Those were major differentiators.\n\n""Nuance was acquired by Microsoft about 10 months ago. But we were a customer long before that for all these reasons. We continue running and building atop Microsoft, both on-premises and in Azure, with a wide array of Nvidia GPU infrastructure for optimized training and model building.""\n\n""AI technology is only as good as the value it creates. The value it creates is only tied to the impact it drives. The impact only happens if it gets deployed and adopted by the users. Great technical people look at the end-to-end workflow and the metrics.\n\n""Don\'t get lost in the technology weeds. Don\'t just get caught up in looking at one tool set or one annotation tool or one inferencing thing. Instead, ask What is the use case? What are the metrics that the use case is trying to move around cost, revenue? What is required to actually get the model deployed? Getting super rigorous around that and not underestimating and falling in love with building the model. It has almost no value if it doesn\'t end up in the workflow and drive impact.""\n\nBottom line: Taking advantage of an established commercial delivery network and cloud ecosystem lets you focus on developing and refining AI models and applications that deliver clear value and help drive key organizational goals. When choosing a network and cloud provider, look closely at three key areas: how their business models impact data privacy, the completeness of their AI development and delivery environment, and their ability to easily scale as widely as you require.\n\nScaling global R&D infrastructure in the cloud helps make next-gen, AI-powered radiation therapy more accessible and personalized -- a conversation with Rui Lopes, Director of New Technology Assessment at Elekta.\n\nIn 2017, Rui Lopes visited a major radiology conference and noticed a big change. Instead of ""big iron and big software,"" which usually took up most of the floor space, almost half of the trade show was now dedicated to AI. To Lopes, the potential value of AI for cancer diagnosis and for cancer treatment was undeniably clear.\n\n""For clinicians, AI offers an opportunity to spend more time with a patient, to be more care-centric rather than just being the person in the darkroom who looks at a radiograph and tries to figure out if there\'s a disease or not,"" says Lopes, Director of New Technology Assessment for Elekta, a global innovator of precision radiation therapy devices. ""But when you recognize that a computer can eventually do that better at a pixel scale, the physician starts to question, what is my real value in this operation?""\n\nToday, the growing openness of healthcare professionals worldwide to asking that question and to embrace the opportunity of cancer care driven by AI is due in no small part to Elekta. Founded in 1972 by a Swedish neurosurgeon, the company gained international renown for its revolutionary Gamma Knife used in non-invasive radiosurgery for brain disorders and cancer, and most recently its groundbreaking Unity integrated MR and linac (linear accelerator) device.\n\nFor much of the last decade, Elekta has been developing and commercializing ML-powered systems for radiology and radiation therapy. Recently, the Stockholm-based company even created a dedicated radiotherapy AI center in Amsterdam called the POP-AART lab. The company is focusing on harnessing the power of AI to provide more advanced and personalized radiation treatments that can be quickly adapted to accommodate any change in the patient during cancer treatments.\n\nAt the same time, Elekta recently launched its ""Access 2025"" initiative that aims to increase radiotherapy access by 20% worldwide, including in underserved regions. Elekta hopes that by integrating more intelligence into their systems they can help overcome common treatment bottlenecks such as shortages of clinician time, equipment and trained operators, and as a result, ease the strain on patients and healthcare providers.\n\nAlong the way, Elekta has learned valuable lessons about AI and scaling, Lopes says, even as company expertise and practices continue to evolve. In these interview highlights, Lopes shares his experience and key learnings about moving to on-demand cloud infrastructure and services.\n\n""We\'re a global organization, 4,700 employees in over 120 countries, with R&D centers spread across more than a dozen regional hubs. Each center might have a different priority for improving a particular product or business line. These disparate groups all do great work, but traditionally they each did it in a bit of isolation.\n\n""As we considered how to ramp up the speed of our AI innovations, we recognized that a common scalable data infrastructure was key to increasing collaboration across teams. That meant understanding data pipelines and how to manage data in a secure and distributed fashion. We also had to understand the development and operational environment for machine learning and AI activities, and how to scale that.""\n\n""As a company, we have traditionally been very physics-based in our research in radiotherapy. Our data and research scientists were all very on-prem-centric for data management and compute. We invested in large servers through large capital purchases and did data preparation and massaging and other work on these local machines.\n\n""AI has a voracious appetite for data, but because of privacy concerns, it\'s a challenge to get access to large volumes of medical data and medical equipment data required to drive AI development. Luckily, we have very good, very precious partner research relationships around the world, and we employ different techniques to respect and maintain strict privacy requirements. But typically, these were small puddles of data being used to try to drive AI initiatives, which is not the ideal formula.\n\n""One thing we did early was establish a larger-scale pipeline of anonymized medical data that we could use to drive some of these activities. We didn\'t want replication of this data lake across all our distributed global research centers. That would mean people would have different copies and different ways of managing, accessing and potentially even securing this data, which we wanted to keep consistent across the organization. Not to mention that we\'d be paying for duplicate infrastructure for no reason. So, a very big part of the AI infrastructure puzzle for us was the warehousing and the management of data.""\n\n""As we delved more and more into ML and AI, we evaluated the shift from on-prem compute to cloud compute. You do a couple of back-of-the-envelope calculations first: Where are you regionally? What are you paying now? What type of GPUs are you using? As you\'re starting this journey, you\'re not quite sure what you\'re going to do. You\'re basing the decision on your current internal capacity, and what it would cost to replicate that in the cloud. Almost invariably, you end up thinking the cloud is more expensive.\n\n""You need to take a step back and shift your perspective on the problem to realize that it\'s only more expensive if I use [cloud] the way I use my on-prem capacity today. If instead you consider the things you can do in cloud that you can\'t do onsite – like run parallel experiments and multiple scenarios at the same time or scale GPU capacity – the calculus is different. It really is a mind shift you have to make.\n\n""As you think of growth, it becomes obvious that migrating to cloud infrastructure can be extremely advantageous. Like with any migration, you have a learning curve to becoming efficient and managing that infrastructure properly. We may have forgotten to \'turn off the lights\' on capacity a couple of times. but you learn to automate much of the management as well.""\n\n""I mentioned the challenges of accessing medical data. But another part of the challenge is that often the data you need to access is a mix of types and standards or consists of proprietary formats that can change over time. You want any infrastructure you build to have flexibility and growth capabilities to accommodate this.\n\n""When we looked around, there was no off-the shelf product for this, which was surprising and a big \'aha moment\' for us. We quickly recognized this was not a core competence for us – you really need to work with trusted partners to build, design and scale out to the right level.\n\n""We were fortunate to have a global partnership with Microsoft, who really helped us understand how best to create an infrastructure and design it for future scaling. One that would let us internally catalog data the right way, allow our researchers to peruse and select data they needed for developing AI-based solutions – all in a way that is consistent with the access speed and latency we were expecting, and the distributed nature of our worldwide research teams and our security policies.""\n\n""We started limited pilots around 2018 and 2019. Rather than betting the bank on a massive and ambitious project, we started small. We continued our current activities and way of working with the on-premises and non-scalable systems, setting aside a little bit of capacity to do limited experiments and pilots.\n\n""Setting up a small Azure environment allowed us to create virtual compute as well and doing a redundant run of a smaller experiment and asking \'What was that experience?\' This meant getting faster, more frequent small wins instead of risking large-project-fatigue with no short-term tangible benefits. These, in turn, provided the confidence to migrate more and more of our AI activities to the cloud.\n\n""With COVID and everybody holed up at home, the distributed virtual Azure environment was very practical with a level of facility and convenience we didn\'t have before.""\n\n""We recognized that we needed to learn as an organization before really jumping into [cloud-based AI]. Learning from it, too, so that parts of the team were getting exposed, understanding how to operate in the environment, how to use and properly leverage the virtual compute capacity. There\'s operational and knowledge inertia to overcome. People say: \'There\'s my server. That\'s my data.\' You have to bring them over to a new way of doing things.\n\n""Now, we\'re in a different space, where the opportunity is much bigger. You can dream bigger in terms of the scale of the experiment that you might want to do. You might be tempted to try to run a really large learning on a massive dataset or a more complex model. But you must have a bit of discipline, walking before you run.""\n\n""Rather than going out and recruiting boatloads of AI experts and throwing them in there and hoping for the best, we recognized we needed a mix of people with domain knowledge of the physics and radiotherapy.\n\n""We did a few experiments where we brought in some real hardcore AI people. Great people, but they\'re interested in developing the next great model architecture, while we\'re more interested in applying solid architectures to create products to treat patients. For us, the application is more important than the novelty of the tech. At least for now, we feel there has to be organic growth, rather than trying to throw an entire new organization or a new research group at the problem. But it\'s a challenge; we\'re still in the process.""\n\n""I\'m in the R&D department, but we interact with the IT department very closely. We interact with the sales and commercial side very closely, too. Our Head of Cloud, Adam Moore, and I have more and more discussions about sharing learnings across corporate initiatives, including data management and strategy and cloud. Those are strands of the DNA of the company that are going to be intertwined as we move forward, that will keep in lockstep.\n\n""If you\'re lucky, IT is a red thread that can help through all of that. But that\'s not always the case for many companies or entire IT departments. There\'s a competence buildup that needs to happen within an organization, and a maturity level within IT. They\'re the sherpa on this journey that hopefully helps you get to the summit. The better the partner, the better the experience.""\n\n""More centers and physicians are embracing the belief that (AI-assisted radiology) can have a positive impact and allow them to get closer to what\'s most important -- providing the best, personalized care to patients that\'s more than just cookie-cutter care because there\'s no time to do anything but that.\n\n""AI is not only helping with the productivity bottleneck, but with what we call adaptation. Even while the patient is on the table, about to be treated, we can take clinical decisions and dynamically modify things on the fly with really fast algorithms. It can make these hour- or day-long processes happen in minutes. It\'s beyond personalization, and it\'s really exciting.""\n\nBottom line: Focus early on data pipelines and infrastructure. Start small, with smart partners and close partnership between IT and the groups developing AI. Don\'t get sidetracked by ""apples- to-oranges"" cost comparisons between cloud and on-premises environments. Instead, expand your vision to include new capabilities like on-demand parallel processing and HPC. And be prepared to patiently overcome organizational inertia and build up new competencies and attitudes toward data sharing. https://venturebeat.com/ai/can-healthcare-show-the-way-forward-for-scaling-ai/?hsamp_network=TWITTER&hsamp=b2MlJT2FU4yL"

"Walmart chases higher profits powered by warehouse robots and automated claws BROOKSVILLE, Fla. -- At first glance, this warehouse looks like many: Forklifts unload pallets from the back of dozens of tractor-trailers. Canned soup, soda and cleaning supplies whiz by on conveyer belts. Store-bound merchandise gets sorted by department and store aisle before getting stacked high like an elaborate game of Tetris.\n\nThe difference? Tasks are powered by giant automated claws and rolling robots, instead of people. The driver\'s seats on the forklifts are empty.\n\nWelcome to the future of Walmart.\n\nThe big-box retailer at an investor event last week previewed how it plans to use automation to more quickly and cost-effectively manage inventory, stock shelves and keep up with online orders. The company took investors on a tour of an approximately 1.4 million-square-foot facility in Brooksville, Florida -- the first automated distribution center for packaged foods and other shelf-stable household items.\n\nWalmart plans to add that same automation from Symbotic -- a warehouse technology company that Walmart took a majority stake in last year -- to all of its 42 regional distribution centers, though it didn\'t share a timetable for doing so. By the end of January, roughly a third of stores will get distribution from the automated facilities, the company said.\n\nWalmart\'s automation is a piece of a broader plan to drive profits higher. CEO Doug McMillon said in the coming years the retailer\'s revenue will grow about 4% year over year -- a slower growth rate than the approximately 8% it saw in the past three Covid pandemic-fueled years, but still faster than growth of 3.1% and 3.6% the retailer posted in the three years prior to the pandemic.\n\nMcMillon added that he expects profits to grow at a quicker pace than sales over the next five years as Walmart adds automation and grows its higher-margin businesses like advertising, last-mile delivery and fulfillment services.\n\nHe said Walmart has given customers more ways to shop online and get those purchases faster. It offers more general merchandise, including exclusive brands in categories like apparel. And it has more sellers that have joined its third-party marketplace, too.\n\n""We\'re now in a phase that is less about scaling store pickup and delivery, e-commerce assortment, and e-commerce FC [fulfillment center] square footage and more about execution and operating margin improvement,"" he said.\n\nIn three years, Walmart anticipates that about two-thirds of its stores will be serviced by some kind of automation, about 55% of fulfillment center volume will move through automated facilities and that unit cost averages could improve by about 20%. https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/walmart-warehouse-automation-powers-higher-profits.html"

To do this, use the packMap method:\n\nHere is a list of type-specific packing methods:\n\nCheck the ""Custom types"" section below on how to pack custom types.\n\nThe Packer object supports a number of bitmask-based options for fine-tuning the packing process (defaults are in bold):\n\nThe type detection mode (DETECT_STR_BIN/DETECT_ARR_MAP) adds some overhead which can be noticed when you pack large (16- and 32-bit) arrays or strings. However, if you know the value type in advance (for example, you only work with UTF-8 strings or/and associative arrays), you can eliminate this overhead by forcing the packer to use the appropriate type, which will save it from running the auto-detection routine. Another option is to explicitly specify the value type. The library provides 2 auxiliary classes for this, Map and Bin. Check the ""Custom types"" section below for details.\n\nTo unpack data you can either use an instance of a BufferUnpacker:\n\nor call a static method on the MessagePack class:\n\nIf the packed data is received in chunks (e.g. when reading from a stream), use the tryUnpack method, which attempts to unpack data and returns an array of unpacked messages (if any) instead of throwing an InsufficientDataException:\n\nIf you want to unpack from a specific position in a buffer, use seek:\n\nTo skip bytes from the current position, use skip:\n\nTo get the number of remaining (unread) bytes in the buffer:\n\nTo check whether the buffer has unread data:\n\nIf needed, you can remove already read data from the buffer by calling:\n\nWith the read method you can read raw (packed) data:\n\nBesides the above methods BufferUnpacker provides type-specific unpacking methods, namely:\n\nThe BufferUnpacker object supports a number of bitmask-based options for fine-tuning the unpacking process (defaults are in bold):\n\n1. The binary MessagePack format has unsigned 64-bit as its largest integer data type, but PHP does not support such integers, which means that an overflow can occur during unpacking.\n\n2. Make sure the GMP extension is enabled.\n\n3. Make sure the Decimal extension is enabled.\n\nIn addition to the basic types, the library provides functionality to serialize and deserialize arbitrary types. This can be done in several ways, depending on your use case. Let\'s take a look at them.\n\nIf you need to serialize an instance of one of your classes into one of the basic MessagePack types, the best way to do this is to implement the CanBePacked interface in the class. A good example of such a class is the Map type class that comes with the library. This type is useful when you want to explicitly specify that a given PHP array should be packed as a MessagePack map without triggering an automatic type detection routine:\n\nMore type examples can be found in the src/Type directory.\n\nAs with type objects, type transformers are only responsible for serializing values. They should be used when you need to serialize a value that does not implement the CanBePacked interface. Examples of such values could be instances of built-in or third-party classes that you don\'t own, or non-objects such as resources.\n\nA transformer class must implement the CanPack interface. To use a transformer, it must first be registered in the packer. Here is an example of how to serialize PHP streams into the MessagePack bin format type using one of the supplied transformers, StreamTransformer:\n\nMore type transformer examples can be found in the src/TypeTransformer directory.\n\nIn contrast to the cases described above, extensions are intended to handle extension types and are responsible for both serialization and deserialization of values (types).\n\nAn extension class must implement the Extension interface. To use an extension, it must first be registered in the packer and the unpacker.\n\nThe MessagePack specification divides extension types into two groups: predefined and application-specific. Currently, there is only one predefined type in the specification, Timestamp.\n\nThe Timestamp extension type is a predefined type. Support for this type in the library is done through the TimestampExtension class. This class is responsible for handling Timestamp objects, which represent the number of seconds and optional adjustment in nanoseconds:\n\nWhen using the MessagePack class, the Timestamp extension is already registered:\n\nApplication-specific extensions\n\nIn addition, the format can be extended with your own types. For example, to make the built-in PHP DateTime objects first-class citizens in your code, you can create a corresponding extension, as shown in the example. Please note, that custom extensions have to be registered with a unique extension ID (an integer from 0 to 127).\n\nMore extension examples can be found in the examples/MessagePack directory.\n\nTo learn more about how extension types can be useful, check out this article.\n\nIf an error occurs during packing/unpacking, a PackingFailedException or an UnpackingFailedException will be thrown, respectively. In addition, an InsufficientDataException can be thrown during unpacking.\n\nAn InvalidOptionException will be thrown in case an invalid option (or a combination of mutually exclusive options) is used.\n\nRun tests as follows:\n\nAlso, if you already have Docker installed, you can run the tests in a docker container. First, create a container:\n\nThe command above will create a container named msgpack with PHP 8.1 runtime. You may change the default runtime by defining the PHP_IMAGE environment variable:\n\nSee a list of various images here.\n\nThen run the unit tests:\n\nTo ensure that the unpacking works correctly with malformed/semi-malformed data, you can use a testing technique called Fuzzing. The library ships with a help file (target) for PHP-Fuzzer and can be used as follows:\n\nTo check performance, run:\n\nYou may change default benchmark settings by defining the following environment variables:\n\nAnother example, benchmarking both the library and the PECL extension:\n\nNote that the msgpack extension (v2.1.2) doesn\'t support ext, bin and UTF-8 str types.\n\nThe library is released under the MIT License. See the bundled LICENSE file for details.\n\nAuthor: rybakit Source Code: https://github.com/rybakit/msgpack.php License: MIT License https://morioh.com/p/0eb288df7d5e?f=5cb7d89d660c8335951ca454"

"Musk under fire for Twitter's shifting rules on state media Taipei, Taiwan – Scrolling through Twitter during the past few weeks, Sarah Hurst, an independent journalist in the United Kingdom, began noticing changes in the way the platform displayed certain government and media accounts.\n\nHurst, who writes about Russia and Ukraine, started seeing more tweets from Russian government accounts, Russian state media and government mouthpieces in her ""For You"" tab.\n\nTwitter launched the tab in January as the new default view for users, displaying algorithmically-selected tweets along with those from accounts the user follows.\n\n""Previously on your settings, you could choose to have tweets organised by \'top tweets\' or chronologically in your newsfeed. I usually had it on \'top tweets\' so I didn\'t miss the biggest news stories,"" Hurst told Al Jazeera.\n\n""Now, whenever I open \'For You,\' I see a stream of Russian and Chinese government propaganda accounts.""\n\n""I have been campaigning against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin since he annexed Crimea in 2014,"" Hurst added.\n\nWhether by accident or design, Twitter is giving greater prominence to government and state-run media accounts that are often criticised for spreading disinformation, such as Russia\'s RT and China\'s Global Times.\n\nThe changes appear to include subtle boosts to state-affiliated accounts as well as more prominent placement in users\' feeds.\n\nIn a Substack post last month, Wenhao Ma, a reporter for the United States government-funded Voice of America, said the top search results for the name of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and the phrase ""US-China"" were posts from Chinese state media denouncing Tsai and the US government.\n\nThe latest changes at the social media giant, which has undergone significant upheaval since its takeover by billionaire tech leader Elon Musk, have prompted concern among journalists and disinformation scholars – as well as broader debate about what counts as disinformation or propaganda and who gets to decide.\n\nSome analysts argue the apparent changes to Twitter\'s algorithm have troubling implications for the public discourse, democracy and the future of the platform itself.\n\n""It\'s clear the algorithm has changed and what counts as being \'for you\' has changed,"" Darren Linvill, an associate professor at South Carolina\'s Clemson University who researches social media disinformation, told Al Jazeera.\n\n""Historically, Twitter has been really good at giving people only stuff that they\'re vaguely looking for, so I think a normal person would be surprised that most of Twitter is some combination of K-Pop and porn. And it didn\'t give you that. Elon is trying to shake things up and clearly, he\'s messing with an algorithm that they\'ve developed over more than a decade to be successful in giving people what they want.""\n\nTimothy Graham, a senior lecturer in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), said the site\'s recommendations were now ""a bit out of control"" compared with the more curated approach of before.\n\n""Some people are seeing harmful war propaganda relating to the Ukraine war coming from Russia and ministers, or from diplomatic accounts, or from Russia Today,"" Graham said.\n\nPrior to Musk\'s purchase of Twitter last October, the platform had taken steps to reduce the reach of certain state-affiliated accounts.\n\nIn 2020, Twitter introduced the label ""state-affiliated media"", which it defines as ""outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution.""\n\nIn practice, this label was almost exclusively applied to Russian and Chinese government media accounts, although Twitter originally said the label would be rolled out to media from the five countries that sit on the United Nations Security Council – China, Russia, France, the United States and the UK.\n\nThe platform\'s guidelines ultimately excluded outlets like the BBC in the UK and National Public Radio, also known as NPR, in the US, both of which receive government funding but are widely regarded as editorially independent.\n\nThose rules, however, are changing – sometimes on a practically daily basis.\n\nLast week, Musk appeared to change Twitter\'s definition of ""state-affiliated media"" by briefly adding the label to NPR, an outlet that right-leaning Americans often accuse of having a liberal bias.\n\nThe label was removed within days after blowback from critics who defended NPR\'s record of editorial independence and noted that government funding accounts for only 2 percent of the outlet\'s budget, although some US conservatives and Chinese-state media employees welcomed the state media tag.\n\nTwitter added a new ""government-funded media"" label to NPR\'s account in its place.\n\nThe designation, which has also been applied to the BBC, PBS and Voice of America in recent days, refers to ""outlets where the government provides some or all of the outlet\'s funding and may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content"".\n\nThe new label has not been added to some other state-funded media, including Al Jazeera and France 24, which are funded by the Qatari and French governments, respectively.\n\nTwitter did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Musk said: ""We want it as truthful and accurate as possible – we\'re adjusting the label to ""[the BBC being] publicly funded – we\'ll try to be accurate.""\n\nEarlier this week, Musk was quoted telling one of NPR\'s reporters: ""If you really think that the government has no influence on the entity they\'re funding then you\'ve been marinating in the Kool-Aid for too long.""\n\nTaken together, the changes at Twitter make it easier to spread propaganda and ""fake news"" about current events, including major conflicts like the war in Ukraine, said Graham, the QUT lecturer.\n\n""Some of them are conspiracy theories about neo-Nazis taking over Ukraine. All of them are trying to justify and provide this narrative justification for what Russia is doing, and all of them are trying to appeal to audiences who will amplify them in one way or another,"" he said.\n\n""It\'s not this kind of hypodermic needle model as if they inject you with false information, and then you believe it and start spreading it,"" Graham added.\n\n""But it\'s more than like we get into a situation where these false and misleading narratives that pollute and just cause chaos …[and] get oxygenated by the rest of the media ecosystem.

"20 Ways Small Businesses Can Ramp Up Their IT It's no secret that living in today's modern world means small businesses everywhere must take advantage of technology to have a competitive edge. The trouble is that many of those firms need to catch up with the latest tech innovations.\n\nYou're likely reading this article today because you own or manage a small business and are still determining whether it's making the best use of its tech resources or, indeed, if you even have the right tools for each job!\n\nThe following twenty ideas, concepts, and tips will help you ramp up your firm's IT and use the best cutting-edge technology, resulting in a smoother, more streamlined, and more productive operation. Take a look:\n\nDevising an IT roadmap for your firm makes perfect sense because it can help you plan and implement technology solutions that align with your business goals and sustain your growth. Your roadmap should include the following points:\n\nThese days, more businesses like yours realize the potential that cloud computing has to offer.\n\nFrom running complex mathematical tasks with computer power provided by an Internet server to cloud workspace solutions that don't require expensive local hardware, there's something for everyone in the cloud.\n\nWhy else should you embrace cloud computing? The biggest reason is the cost savings, and equally important is the ease of scalability.\n\nMore small businesses are depending on automation to scale up their IT processes. For example, using robotics to carry out repetitive work means that employees can utilize their skills in other areas or support different operational requirements.\n\nEmbracing automation in your organization is an excellent way to ramp up your IT because it offers numerous benefits, such as increased efficiency, better accuracy, and lower operational costs.\n\nIt's no secret that many employees always keep their mobile devices within eye contact. For example, a study by Udemy concluded that 87% of workers have their devices where they can see them. Surveys by other sources also report similar statistics.\n\nExpanding your firm's use of mobile technology will be beneficial in so many ways:\n\nAccording to Verizon's data breach investigations report, 43% of cybercrime victims were small businesses. Moreover, cybercriminals typically target them because of inferior security measures.\n\nThat's why it makes sense to have a firm IT cybersecurity policy in place as part of your efforts to ramp up your business's IT. Having such a policy means your firm can better protect sensitive data and minimize the risk of financial losses.\n\nAnother way to ramp up your IT processes is by gaining insight into your business data.\n\nDoing so will help you identify areas for improvement, such as upgrading systems and Internet connections if your outdated infrastructure is causing your business to operate inefficiently.\n\nBusiness data insight can also help you identify trends and patterns, enabling you to make better financial and operational decisions.\n\nIt might not seem like it, but leasing your IT equipment instead of buying it makes perfect business sense and helps you ramp up your IT infrastructure in many ways.\n\nA study by ELFA (Equipment Leasing and Finance Association) suggests that leasing helps businesses save 30% on IT equipment costs. There are also maintenance, support, and tax benefits compared to outright purchases.\n\nWhether you lease or buy your IT equipment, having an upgrade plan in place is a good idea. Doing so ensures that you keep productivity at high levels, bolster security, and decrease the risk of equipment breakdowns.\n\nAlso, it's worth remembering that consumers are more likely to have confidence in small businesses that invest in modern and reliable IT equipment.\n\nEvery business, regardless of size, should have a disaster recovery plan:\n\nIf your small business's IT operations are 20 years behind its competitors, one way to bring them into the 21st century is by selling your products and services online.\n\nE-commerce offers many advantages to firms, such as increased reach, consumer convenience, lower costs, and a 24/7 storefront.\n\nYou will find that many e-commerce solutions can connect to internal IT systems for seamless order processing and credit control functions.\n\nIs your small business guilty of being inefficient? If so, one way to combat that problem is by having your teams use collaboration tools.\n\nSuch solutions ensure there is no risk of duplication, staff will make fewer mistakes, and they can work together on projects from different sites or locations. One example of a popular collaboration tool is Microsoft Teams.\n\nSome small businesses waste time and money on offline marketing ideas and projects. A better use of those resources is with digital marketing, and plenty of IT solutions exist to help meet individual needs.\n\nFor instance, you could use tools like SEMRush to handle your online reach or an outsourced marketing agency to manage social media marketing and SEO (search engine optimization).\n\nCRM is an acronym for Customer Relationship Management.\n\nA CRM helps small businesses like yours manage their interactions with new and existing customers. It includes contact and lead management, data analytics, and forecasting tools, among other valuable features.\n\nUsing a CRM will help you ramp up your IT by streamlining how you deal with customers and make business decisions based on what they buy.\n\nYour small business likely deals with projects for specific customers. IT can be very beneficial in helping with project management for several reasons:\n\nHaving the latest equipment at your premises is undoubtedly one way to ramp up your IT, but only if people fully understand how to operate them! That's why you must have a clear and consistent training program for all employees.\n\nConsider partnering with an external training provider to deliver the proper training to your staff.\n\nIf organizing your firm's IT infrastructure, support, and maintenance fills you with fear and dread, outsourcing those tasks to an external IT provider is a good idea.\n\nThankfully, you can leave your business's IT needs in the capable hands of a professional that will save you time, money, and stress!\n\nThere's no denying that COVID-19 has changed how small businesses operate in today's modern world. COVID-19 is still at the forefront of people's minds, as is ensuring safe working practices.\n\nOne way to ease your team's minds is by encouraging COVID-safe virtual meetings using online tools like Skype.\n\nEveryone wants to lead greener lifestyles and help the environment as much as possible, and businesses must be more eco-friendly these days. Did you know sustainable technology is an excellent way to achieve that goal?\n\nFor example, cloud computing reduces the need for in-house IT resources, and many data centers are carbon-neutral.\n\nWhat IT equipment do you have? How old is each device? When were they last maintained? If you don't know the answers to basic questions like those, you need to put in place a regular IT audit at your small business.\n\nDoing so will significantly improve your firm's IT operations and positively impact other areas, such as productivity, efficiency, and cost.\n\nConsider implementing a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy at your workplace. You could incentivize workers to use their mobile phones and laptops, such as offering extra paid holidays or other perks, while lowering your IT costs and maintenance requirements. https://thefutureofthings.com/18658-20-ways-small-businesses-can-ramp-up-their-it/"

"Debunking Popular Web Development Myths: What You Need to Know for a Successful Project Every organization, its employees, clients, partners, and users derive meaning from the different ways different organizations approach the development process. The work style influences perceptions, presumptions, and the types of web development projects being handled.\n\nWeb development constantly evolves, with new technologies and techniques being introduced daily. Unfortunately, this also means many misconceptions about web development can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. This article will look at some of the most common misconceptions surrounding web development and how they can be addressed.\n\nMany businesses have been hesitant to go online due to the myths they have heard about web development. Many things need to be clarified out there that can make it difficult for businesses to make an informed decision when developing a website. This article will debunk some of the most common myths about web development that keep companies from going online. We will discuss why these myths are untrue and how businesses can benefit from having a website.\n\nWeb development is often thought of as a cheap and easy process that anyone can do. However, this is far from the truth. Creating a website can be daunting for many people, as the cost and time involved can be intimidating.\n\nWeb development requires extensive knowledge of coding languages, design principles, and user experience to create attractive and functional websites. Additionally, web development costs can vary depending on the complexity of the project and the resources needed to complete it. While it is true that building an expansive e-commerce site or an enterprise web application can be expensive, basic websites can be relatively inexpensive. When a website\'s content/layout is appealing, 38% of users will continue engaging. (Source:Bluecorona.com)\n\nFor example, many website-building platforms offer packages that start at around $5 a month. In addition, many web developers provide services at very competitive rates. Therefore, it is important to understand all aspects of web development before making any assumptions about its cost or ease.\n\nThere are many differences between the various website platforms available today, and it\'s important to understand these differences to make an informed decision about which platform is best for your needs. Brand differentiation is a priority for 73% of companies. (Source:.Bluecorona.com)\n\nA website platform is a software application or set of tools that enables users to build and manage a website. Venues provide users with various features, such as content management systems, user accounts, and e-commerce functionality. Users can choose from multiple templates and designs to create their ideal website, depending on the platform type.\n\nDid you know that 48% of people rate a company\'s credibility based on its website design ? (Source:.Bluecorona.com)\n\nThe creation of a website does not make someone a web developer. Although web development does not require formal qualifications, it does require knowledge of coding languages, databases, and web servers, as well as an understanding of how to design and build websites. Creating a website may be part of a web developer\'s job description, but it is not the only task they do. The top web development companies in the United States have a deep understanding of the technologies involved in web development and the ability to create functional and visually appealing websites.\n\nDepending on the specific needs of a project, there may be different technologies or software that are more suitable to ensure the website functions properly and efficiently. Every website is different and requires a tailored approach. Depending on the user requirements, some websites may require more complex technologies or software than others. Therefore, staying up to date on the latest trends is important to remain competitive.\n\nCybersecurity is an important issue for any website owner. While not worrying about it may seem appealing, it\'s important to understand that cyber security basics should be implemented to protect your site from hackers and malicious software. This article will discuss the importance of cyber security basics for websites and how you can secure your site from potential threats.\n\nRegular upkeep of websites is essential for their success and longevity. Without proper maintenance and updates, a website can become outdated quickly, leading to decreased performance and potential security risks.\n\nThe cost of updating a website depends on the complexity of the changes and the frequency of the updates. Making small changes to an existing website is relatively inexpensive, but larger updates may require more time and resources. Therefore, it\'s important to factor in the cost of updates when creating a budget for any website project.\n\nThe responsive web design allows desktop webpages to be resized to fit other devices. Besides having a beautiful website, it is also necessary to ensure that the pages look the same on different devices. In today\'s market, it is imperative. Additionally, Google now penalizes websites that aren\'t responsive.\n\nWhile writing code is a crucial part of the web development process, it\'s only one aspect of a much larger and more complex discipline. Web development involves many skills and responsibilities, including project management, user experience design, quality assurance, and ongoing maintenance and optimization.\n\nIn addition, web developers must be able to understand and translate the needs and goals of their clients into effective and user-friendly websites. Effective communication, problem-solving skills, and understanding of the latest technologies and trends are also essential for success in web development.\n\nThus, while writing code is an important part of the job, web development is more than just writing code. It\'s a complex and multi-disciplinary field that requires a wide range of skills and expertise to succeed.\n\nIn reality, web development involves various skills and technologies, and proficiency in multiple programming languages is often necessary. For example, a web developer may use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and a server-side language like PHP or Ruby for dynamic content and database integration.\n\nIn addition, web developers must be familiar with databases, version control systems, and other tools used in the web development process. While it\'s possible for a web developer to specialize in a single language, having a broad knowledge base and being proficient in multiple languages is often more desirable, as it allows for greater flexibility and the ability to tackle a wider range of projects.\n\nThus, being a successful web developer requires a commitment to ongoing learning and development as the field constantly evolves and new technologies emerge.\n\nLaunching a website is just the beginning of the journey. To be truly successful, a website requires ongoing effort and attention. This may include marketing and promotion to attract visitors, ongoing optimization to improve user experience and search engine rankings, and regular updates and improvements to keep the site relevant and engaging.\n\nIn addition, websites must be monitored for technical issues and security vulnerabilities, and any necessary changes must be made promptly. A website left to ""run itself"" will likely become outdated and lose traffic over time. A successful website results from a long-term commitment to continuous improvement and a dedication to meeting the evolving needs of users and customers.\n\nWhile web developers need to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field, blindly following the latest trends and technologies can lead to poor decision-making and subpar results. Instead, it\'s more important to consider each project\'s specific goals and needs carefully and use the technologies and trends that best meet those needs.\n\nFor example, using the latest JavaScript framework may not be necessary or even appropriate for a simple brochure website, but it may be essential for a complex web application. By being strategic and thoughtful in their use of technology, web developers can create websites that are effective, efficient, and meet the specific needs of their clients.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly digital and connected, the demand for web development skills and e-commerce web development skills is continously growing. The internet has become an essential part of our daily lives. Businesses and organizations of all sizes rely on websites to reach customers, share information, and sell products and services.\n\nThe ongoing development of new technologies, such as b2b ecommerce website development, mobile devices and the Internet of Things, will only increase the demand for web development skills in the years to come.

"Bali searches for answers after unusual whale strandings Bali, Indonesia – An unusual series of whale strandings have raised concern in Indonesia, with three of the massive mammals beached on Bali since the start of April.\n\nIt all began when the rotting carcass of an 11-metre-long (36 feet) Bryde\'s whale was found on a beach on Bali\'s southwest coast on April 1.\n\nThen, last Wednesday a live sperm whale measuring 18 metres (59 ft) was found stranded on a beach in the southeast. Locals managed to push it back out to sea but hours later it was stranded on another beach, where it died.\n\nThe most recent event took place over the weekend when the carcass of a 17-metre-long (56 ft) sperm whale – a deep-sea species that does not commonly become stranded – was discovered on Bali\'s southwest coast.\n\nThe events are part of a wider phenomenon that has seen 21 unexplained whale strandings across Indonesia since the start of the year, according to the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Affairs. They include the partial carcass of a 10-metre (32 ft) sperm whale that washed ashore on Bali\'s southern coast on January 19 and the remains of a 10 metre (32 ft) sperm whale found floating off the coast of the Kangean Islands, a small archipelago 120km (75 miles) north of Bali, on Monday.\n\nPermana Yudiarso, who has coordinated government responses for marine mammal strandings in Bali since 2012, said the frequency of recent strandings on the island was abnormal.\n\n""Last year, we had nine incidents in Indonesia. Normally we have less than 20 every year. But three cases in a week only in Bali – it\'s quite concerning,"" Yudiarso, who is the head of the Bali office for coastal resource management at the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Affairs, told Al Jazeera.\n\nPost-mortem examinations are being conducted on samples taken from two of the three whales found on the island. But even when the results are made public later this month, they are unlikely to provide a definitive answer for the spate of incidents.\n\nSome wildlife campaigners point the finger at plastics. Indonesia is the world\'s second-largest source of marine plastic pollution after China, according to Indonesia\'s Coordinating Ministry of Maritime Affairs.\n\n""Plastic pollution, when plastic is found inside whale stomachs, and noise pollution, when sonar the whales use for navigation is harmed by underwater noise and they get confused and beach themselves, are two of the leading causes of death,"" said Femke den Haas, a wildlife paramedic and co-founder of the Jakarta Animal Network.\n\nIn 2018, a sperm whale was found dead in the waters of Wakatobi National Marine Park some 1,000km (621 miles) northeast of Bali with 115 plastic cups, 25 plastic bags, four plastic bottles and two sandals in its stomach.\n\nA smaller amount of plastic was also found inside the stomach of one of the sperm whales that beached itself in west Bali earlier this month. ""We still cannot say if the cause of death was plastic. It could be disease,"" Yudiarso said.\n\nStill, he noted there was something of a pattern in the strandings, which tend to be more common in the transition period between the wet and dry seasons.\n\n""We are in the middle of that period now,"" Yudiarso said. ""It could be related to the tropical storm we had in Java last month or a more recent storm north of Australia in the Timor Sea. We also can\'t rule out the effects of underwater earthquakes – we have them all the time in Bali. On Monday morning, there were two earthquakes and that might have disturbed the whales\' sonar.""\n\nSumarsono, the head of the conservation section for the Bali Natural Resources Conservation Agency, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name, shared an alternate theory.\n\n""The south of Bali has many steep sloping tidal flats where the difference between high tide and low tide is extreme, creating a natural trap,"" Sumarsono explained.\n\n""Many marine creatures get trapped close to the shore and by the time they realise something is wrong, it is too late for them to return to the deep ocean. Bali is in the middle of the migratory route between Indonesia and East Timor, so getting trapped is a more likely cause of death than disease. It\'s statistically improbable that three whales would die of disease in one week.""\n\nThen there is the issue of rising sea temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels and the associated depletion of oxygen levels in the ocean from soaking up carbon dioxide.\n\nA study, published in 2019 in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change, warned the warming oceans were driving extinction risks higher and marine biological richness lower. ""Multiple regions in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans are particularly vulnerable to marine heatwave intensification due to the co-existence of high levels of biodiversity,"" the study said. It identified the waters of Indonesia as one of the five worst affected areas.\n\nOcean heat hit a record high in 2022.\n\nKaren Stockin, a professor of marine biology at Massey University in New Zealand, said it was important to differentiate between climate change and regular marine heat waves – periods of abnormally high ocean temperatures relative to the average seasonal temperature caused by short-term weather phenomena like El Niño events.\n\n""They are quite different but they both have the potential to change the distribution of prey like squid, and that runs the risk of predators like whales that are dependent on squids to change their distribution in response,"" she said. ""If changes in distribution bring whales closer to shore, that can potentially increase their risk of stranding.""\n\nSumarsono noted that two of three whales that most recently beached in Bali had large amounts of squid inside their stomachs.\n\nBut that is not necessarily a smoking gun, according to Stockin.\n\n""The important thing to consider in strandings like these is that the causes are quite complex. It\'s rarely easy to put your finger on any singular cause. In most cases, strandings are caused most often by a multitude of factors.""\n\nVanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist who has studied whale beachings extensively in the Australian state of Tasmania, an island that like Bali has been described as a natural ""whale trap"", said the phenomenon remained largely a mystery.\n\n""What makes the recent strandings in Bali even more interesting is the two very different species which have stranded: sperm whales have teeth and use high-frequency sonar to communicate and navigate, and Bryde\'s whales, which are toothless and use low-frequency sonar. So each stranding event might be completely independent and occurred due to a variety of different reasons,"" she told Al Jazeera.\n\n""They may be connected or they may have just been a bizarre week of coincidences where three whales have stranded on one island. Maybe something spooked them. Maybe one of them died of old age or was ill but it\'s far too soon to make that call. The results of the post-mortem examinations may help understand the causes and identify a link, but that\'s not a given. In short, we will probably never know what caused their deaths. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/bali-searches-for-answers-after-unusual-whale-strandings"

"Kwame Brathwaite, 85, Photographer With a Lens on Black Pride, Is Dead Kwame Brathwaite, a photographer whose visceral, often elegiac pictures of cultural figures like Muhammad Ali and James Brown, along with Black fashion models and ordinary citizens, were hailed as a catalyst of the ""Black is beautiful"" movement of the 1960s and beyond, died on April 1. He was 85.\n\nHis death, in a Manhattan hospital, was confirmed by his son Kwame S. Brathwaite Jr.\n\nAs a freelance photojournalist for Black publications like The New York Amsterdam News, The City Sun and Essence magazine, Mr. Brathwaite chronicled the struggles of the civil rights era in his native New York. But he also traveled the world to file dispatches from the front lines in the battle for Pan-African unity.\n\nIn 1972, he captured Wattstax, the music festival in Los Angeles that has been called the Black Woodstock, with headliners like the Staples Singers and Isaac Hayes. In 1974, he traveled to Africa to shoot the brutal glory of the heavyweight boxing championship match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. That same year, he accompanied the Jackson 5 on their first trip to Africa.\n\nTanisha C. Ford, a historian at the University of Delaware, wrote of Mr. Brathwaite in the photography magazine Aperture in 2017, ""His images, carefully calibrated to reflect a moment precisely, made Black beautiful for those who lived in the 1960s, and continue to do so for a generation today who might only now be discovering his work. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/12/arts/kwame-brathwaite-dead.html"

"Creative Class: The Hunt For The Next Generation Of Web3 And AI Creative Talent Gathers Momentum SYKY Collective graphic\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Outlier Ventures X Farfetch Dream Assembly Base Camp accelerator program for Web3 technical start-ups comes a raft of initiatives geared more towards fostering the digital and artificial intelligence (AI) creative talent of the future.\n\nLatest is The SYKY Collective luxury fashion incubator for digital fashion designers. It\'s been created by luxury fashion platform SYKY which was founded last year by former Ralph Lauren chief digital and content officer Alice Delahunt with a mission to bridge the gap between traditional luxury fashion and the emerging Web3 universe. The incubator is the next step towards the realization of this goal.\n\n""We believe that the next generation of major luxury houses are designing in digital worlds today and that the SYKY Collective will be the launchpad of many of these next generation luxury fashion houses,"" said Delahunt in a statement.\n\nParticipants will receive mentorship from industry leaders hailing from both the world of traditional luxury fashion and the Web3 universe. They include Caroline Rush, CEO of the British Fashion Council (BFC), Jonathan Bottomley CMO of Calvin Klein, Mark Guiducci creative editorial Director of Vogue and Red DAO Founder Megan Kaspar.\n\nHowever, that\'s just the start. They will also benefit from a year-long proprietary curriculum to produce graduates with the skills they need to launch their own luxury digital fashion houses both in terms of technical and design capabilities and more strategic ones such as how to scale a business and distribute product.\n\nProgram participants will also get access to the curriculum provided by the BFC to its member designers to its own emerging designers -- alumni include Phoebe Philo, Johnathan Anderson and Simone Rocha. Additional benefits involve access to traditional fashion industry and calendar events, the ability to showcase their genesis collection on the SYKY platform and eligibility for partnerships with traditional luxury brands.\n\nEach year The SYKY Collective will onboard a new cohort of digital designers. The inaugural cohort will number 10. Applications are now open and close May 2 with successful applicants announced in early June. The program will commence at the end of June.\n\nSuch initiatives don\'t just go one way. Enter the Monnier Paris Fashion Prize for Web3 Creators launched over Metaverse Fashion Week by French e-commerce platform Monnier Paris in partnership with with Decentraland and digital fashion brand Republiq. Finalists will have their submission turned into a real life bag via 3D printing technology and sold on Monnier Paris with an accompanying NFT.\n\nFive finalists will be selected by a jury whose number includes Pierre Nicolas Hurstel CEO of Arianee, Xavier Romatet Managing Director at Institut Français de la Mode and Quentin Staes Polet Managing Director of Epic Games\' Unreal Engine, with the final winner determined by public vote in September.\n\nAccording to Monnier Paris CEO Diaa Elyaacoubi-Bouriez, the aim is to spotlight digital talent and create a bridge with the real world. ""We are convinced that they will massively shape the luxury fashion industry of the future,"" she said in an interview.\n\nOn the Artificial Intelligence side, comes AI Fashion Week, backed by Spring Studios and e-commerce platform Revolve Group. Commencing 20 April the project will showcase collections by 30 emerging AI designers selected from around 350 submissions. Each submitted 15 to 30 looks and accessories created using AI tools such as Mid Journey and Stable Diffusion.\n\nA competition element will see 1o finalists selected by public vote from which a panel that includes Celine head of men\'s casting Natalie Hazzout, Erika Wykes-Sneyd, VP of Adidas\'s Three Stripes Studio; Vogue Japan head of editorial content Tiffany Godoy, Matthew Drinkwater, head of London College of Fashion\'s Innovation Agency and Revolve CEO Michael Mente will determine the three winners in May. Winners will have physical pieces produced by Revolve which will take care of everything from sampling to branding said Cyril Foiret in an interview. Foiret is the founder of AI creative studio Maison Meta, which is producing AI Fashion Week.\n\nThe idea, he said, is to ""gather together a digital fashion community that currently just lives online and give them a chance to potentially become a (physical) fashion designer.""\n\nInterestingly, 70% of competitors are female with ages ranging from 16 to 68. They hail from different backgrounds he revealed.

But, you know, you might be dangerous, too, according to the FBI. And you don\'t even have to be an angry parent at a school board meeting.\n\nYou just have to use words.

There\'s extremists out there who might say they\'ve been red pilled, but some of them also play soccer. It\'s the mistake the media loves to play, and now the FBI does, too.

"Bangladesh receives first gasoil delivery via new India-Bangladesh pipeline Bangladesh received in the second half of March around 9,000 mt of 0.005% sulfur gasoil from India via the new India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline which connects the two countries, a senior official at state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation told S&P Global Commodity Insights April 11.\n\nReceive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\n\nIndia\'s Numaligarh Refinery Ltd transported the oil from its Shiliguri marketing terminal via the pipeline to Bangladesh\'s Parbatipur depot, the official said.\n\nOf the total imports, around 6,800 mt of gasoil remained in the pipeline, the official said, adding that some gasoil was required to remain in the pipeline to ensure a smooth supply of fuel.\n\nBangladesh will continue importing gasoil via this pipeline in phases depending on the country\'s needs, especially for its northern districts which are located far from sea ports.\n\n""It will take only two to three days for Indian gasoil to reach Bangladesh districts through this pipeline,"" the BPC official said.\n\nThe Indian Rupee 3.77 billion ($45.86 million) project was inaugurated on March 21 and is a part of an energy sector cooperation between the two neighbors through which Bangladesh will import gasoil from India.\n\nThe pipeline stretches 125 km through Bangladesh and 5 km through India, passing through Panchagarh, Nilphamari and Dinajpur before reaching the Parbatipur oil storage facility in Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh, however, will not be able to tap the full potential of the newly built pipeline until it completes the construction of oil storage tanks with capacities amounting to 29,000 mt at the Parbatipur depot. The tanks are currently under construction and expected to be completed within the next several months, BPC chairman ABM Azad said.\n\nIndian piped gasoil will be consumed by the northern agricultural region, where gasoil demand stands at around 1.1 million mt/year, representing around one-fifth of Bangladesh\'s total gasoil requirements.\n\nThe pipeline has the capacity to import around 80,000 mt of gasoil monthly, Azad said, adding that imports via the pipeline will be cheaper and more efficient than rail supplies.\n\nBPC has been purchasing 0.005% gasoil from NRL for 15 years at a negotiated premium of $5.50/b to the Mean of Platts Arab Gulf gasoil assessments on a CFR basis, he said.\n\nInitially, the pipeline is likely to carry around 250,000 mt/year of gasoil under the agreement between the two countries, BPC\'s senior official said. The volume will gradually increase to 400,000 mt/year during the first five years and may subsequently increase to around 1 million mt/year, Azad said.\n\nThe volume may also be adjusted periodically based on demand, and imports may be extended beyond the agreed 15 years subject to mutual discussion, he added.\n\nBangladesh\'s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said this development plays a vital role in ensuring the country\'s fuel security at a time when the world was facing a serious energy crisis due to the Ukraine war.\n\n""Apart from ensuring fuel security, the pipeline will increase economic growth,"" she said.\n\nHasina said the time and expenditure for importing diesel from India will be reduced significantly by this pipeline.\n\nBPC started receiving refined petroleum products from India\'s state-owned Indian Oil Corp in March after a three-year hiatus.\n\nState-run BPC inked a deal with state-owned Indian Oil Corp to supply around 333,000 mt of 0.005% sulfur gasoil, 40,000 mt of jet A-1 fuel and 20,000 mt of 95 RON gasoline until December 2023, the BPC official said. The oil products will be supplied via waterborne vessels.\n\nPrior to the launch of the cross-country pipeline, Bangladesh was solely dependent on coastal tankers, railways and lorries to transport refined oils to end-users after imports from global suppliers reached tanks at Chattogram, which has no major oil-carrying pipeline.\n\nSmall, mostly private-owned barges carried petroleum products on river routes for BPC, Azad added. https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/041223-bangladesh-receives-first-gasoil-delivery-via-new-india-bangladesh-pipeline"

"Leaked classified intelligence suggests US is pessimistic that Ukraine can end war quickly. Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week which purport to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThe videos appear to be of separate events – one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer.\n\nThe first video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8. It was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle.\n\nIn the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker\'s identification.\n\n""(The armoured vehicle) got f**ked by a mine,"" the voice, speaking Russian, says.\n\nApparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, ""They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.""\n\nThe dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.\n\nRussian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war\'s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video\'s location.\n\nThe second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began.\n\nShortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: ""There will be an accountability for everything. https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-04-12-23/index.html"
"Asian refiners back OPEC  cut but fret over regional oil demand on weak macroeconomics Refiners across East Asia have been supportive of the latest OPEC  decision to cut production to some extent as the move aimed to inject some stability to the sharp downtrend in benchmark crude prices seen in March, but middle distillate marketers are concerned that a new price uptrend would be detrimental to regional oil demand amid Asia\'s fragile consumer confidence and high inflation.\n\nReceive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\n\nAsian refiners share the same sentiment with major OPEC  crude producers to the extent that they do not like seeing any sharp and rapid decline in prices, which would often incur hefty inventory losses, according to trading and fuel marketing sources at various regional refiners, including PTT, SK Innovation, Cosmo Oil and CPC Taiwan over April 6-12. Refiners would also wish to avoid having to sell their refined products at much lower outright prices than what they paid for their feedstock crude in prior months, they added.\n\n""If prices fall or trend lower gradually, it is much easier to hedge and protect the value of our inventory barrels, while margins for the prompt and forward month [refined product] export cargoes would generally be maintained,"" a trading and marketing manager at a Japanese refiner said.\n\n""It\'s a complete different story if [benchmark crude] prices fall $10/b or more within a matter of a few days or weeks,"" a middle distillate sales and marketing source at a major South Korean refiner based in Incheon said. People would generally assume that refiners would always prefer lower crude prices so they can buy their feedstock cheaper, but highly export-oriented South Korean refiners are extremely sensitive to a decline in outright oil product prices as well, the South Korean marketing source added.\n\nIn terms of the overall economic picture, however, a fresh upward momentum in oil prices following the OPEC  production cut decision April 2 would hurt Asian consumer spending and confidence, which has been extremely fragile amid high inflation, weak local currencies and tepid economic growth, middle distillate marketers at South Korean, Japanese and Thai refiners said.\n\nA further uptick in benchmark oil prices above $90/b, on top of the US dollar\'s strength against the basket of Asian currencies, would lead to tighter private and middle-income household spending, putting severe pressure on Asia-wide transportation and industrial fuel sales, according to oil product marketers at Thai and Japanese refiners and a senior market research analyst at Korea Petroleum Association based in Seoul.\n\nAlthough Thailand\'s tourism has been staging a gradual recovery over the past year, the road to full pre-pandemic level recovery in tourist arrivals appears far-fetched. A rise in inflation driven by higher oil and overall energy prices could typically dampen the overseas travel desire of young consumers and middle-income families in advanced Asian economies such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, a middle distillate marketer and a regional oil demand analyst at PTT said.\n\nTourist arrivals play a significant role in Thailand\'s domestic automotive and jet fuel sales. The country\'s tourism sector faces headwinds when consumer confidence in major tourist sources such as South Korea and Japan falters, putting pressure on PTT\'s typical annual domestic oil product sales of around 1 million b/d, the analyst at the state-run Thai oil company said.\n\nThe number of international tourist arrivals in Thailand reached 11.15 million in 2022, sharply above 430,000 in 2021 but still far below the 2019 peak of 39.8 million, indicating considerable room for improvement.\n\nWith international borders opening up after COVID-19 restrictions, cross-border travel has gained some momentum. However, private spending and consumer sentiment in South Korea are extremely fragile, as higher oil and gas prices have led to a sharp jump in utility bills and pump prices, the KPA analyst said. This means overseas travel is the last thing on South Korean consumers\' minds, the analyst added.\n\nWith the Japanese yen hovering around a 24-year low and the South Korean won changing hands at around a decade-low against the US dollar, consumers are generally expected to limit overseas traveling during the late spring and peak summer holiday periods. Refiners are focusing more on domestic sales than exports, according to diesel and gasoline sales strategists at major South Korean and Japanese refiners.\n\nMassive hikes in costs of living are driving Japanese households to save on gasoline to kerosene, causing downward pressure on oil product sales in Asia\'s third-biggest oil-consuming nation, S&P Global Commodity Insights reported previously.\n\nWeak demand has negative consequences on the prices of oil products. The monthly average of Japan\'s gasoline and gasoil assessments fell for three consecutive months until March from the previous year, while the kerosene assessment decreased for two consecutive months, according to S&P Global.\n\nAlthough annual headline inflation in Tokyo cooled a little bit to 3.3% in March from 3.4% in February, the core inflation -- which strips away energy and fresh food prices -- accelerated for fourteen consecutive months to 3.4%, a 33-year high since January 1990, according to government data.\n\nThe current administration led by prime minister Fumio Kishida plans to spend more than Yen 2 trillion ($15.3 billion) as part of its effort to cushion the impact of inflation. The package includes cash handouts to low-income families and subsidies to liquified petroleum gas users in rural areas. https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/041223-asian-refiners-back-opec-cut-but-fret-over-regional-oil-demand-on-weak-macroeconomics"
"Most plastic eaten by city vultures comes straight from food outlets Since the 1950s, humanity has produced an estimated 8.3 billion tons of plastic, adding a further 380 million tons to this amount each year. Only 9% of this gets recycled. The inevitable result is that plastic is everywhere, from the depths of the oceans to the summit of Everest--and notoriously, inside the tissues of humans and other organisms.\n\nThe long-term effects of ingested plastic on people aren\'t yet known. But in rodents, ingested microplastics can impair the function of the liver, intestines, and exocrine and reproductive organs.\n\nEspecially at risk of ingesting plastic are scavenging birds. For example, New World vultures regularly forage at landfills, and have been observed to leisurely pick at synthetic materials such as boat seats, rubber seals, and roofs.\n\nNow, researchers from the U.S. have shown that the amount of plastic ingested by black and turkey vultures (Coragyps atratus and Cathartes aura) can be predicted from their location on suburban and exurban maps. This isn\'t just a distinction between country versus city birds; the amount ingested depends on the local density of human commerce within urbanized landscapes. These findings are published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.\n\n""Here we show that black vultures and turkey vultures in areas with more urban development and a greater density of commercial food providers ingest more plastic,"" said Hannah Partridge, a doctoral student at the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and the study\'s first author.\n\n""It\'s possible that they eat some of this plastic on purpose rather than exclusively by accident, as is typically believed.""\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Partridge et al. studied eight communal roosts shared by black and turkey vultures across the Charlotte Metropolitan Area (human population 2.8 million and growing). Roosts typically host between 20 and 500 vultures. Beneath the roosts, they collected a total of 1,087 pellets of undigested material vomited up by the vultures.\n\nOf these pellets, 60% were found to contain plastic, making up 2.7% of the total mass on average. Other components included vegetation, dirt, rocks, animal remains, metal, fabric, paper, wood, and glass. The authors could identify the types of plastic material with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The most commonly found were silicone rubber (7.5% of samples analyzed), high density polyethylene (7.0%), polyethylene (6.4%), and silicate bio polyethylene (5.3%).\n\nThe researchers then searched for associations between the amount of plastic within pellets and four measures of human development within increasing distances--from 400 meters to 20 kilometers as the vulture flies--from the roost. These were the density of commercial food providers (from mom-and-pop stores and food trucks to supermarkets and restaurants), the density of livestock and game producers, the amount of developed landcover, and the distance to the nearest landfill.\n\nExploratory statistical analyses showed that the proportion of pellet mass composed of plastic strongly increased with increasing urban landcover and increasing density of food providers within 20 kilometers. From these results and direct observations, the authors concluded that especially black vultures in the Charlotte Metropolitan Area might be primarily ingesting plastics directly at dumpsters belonging to food providers.\n\n""Black vultures will often roost overnight on a transmission tower next to a fast food restaurant and fly straight to the dumpster first thing in the morning,"" observed Partridge. ""Turkey vultures do this less often; they prefer more rural areas and natural food sources.""\n\nBut do the vultures eat all this plastic on purpose or by accident? The researchers hypothesized that vultures might commonly mistake plastic for nutritious bone fragments, which they would normally get from carrion.\n\n""Vultures are curious and always looking for new food sources, so they may ingest plastic thinking it\'s food,"" said Partridge. ""But they may also sometimes ingest plastic intentionally, to collect bulk to help vomit up indigestible parts of carrion like hair.""\n\nSo what can we do to prevent plastic from being eaten by vultures and other vulnerable animals?\n\n""Food providers such as restaurants and grocery stores can ensure that their garbage is properly bagged, that trash makes it to the dumpster, and that the dumpster is closed and secured. We can also work towards banning single-use plastics to protect vultures and other species from harm,"" advised senior author Dr. Sara Gagné, an associate professor in the same department.\n\nMore information: Vultures in the southeastern United States ingest more plastic in landscapes with more developed landcover, Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution (2023).

"After 25 Years of Peace in Northern Ireland, Some Still Wait for Prosperity The two neighborhoods -- one mostly Roman Catholic, the other mostly Protestant -- have been divided for generations, split by the religious and political lines in Northern Ireland that fueled the decades-long conflict known as the Troubles and, even with 25 years of a peace deal, have not fully gone away.\n\nBut last week, on Good Friday, the residents took part in a gesture of unity that would have been unthinkable a generation ago: They joined hands to create a human chain stretching across their two neighborhoods.\n\nAs Northern Ireland celebrates the 25th anniversary of the peace deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement, the display in West Belfast was a signal not just of the progress that has been made, but also of how the two communities have a surprising amount in common, especially nowadays.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Biden touched down in Northern Ireland for a visit to honor the anniversary of the agreement and to meet the leaders of Northern Ireland's five political parties.

"During Ramadan, Palestinians Picnic in Aqsa Compound to Break Fast On Wednesday, Israeli police raided the compound, arresting hundreds of Palestinian worshipers who had barricaded themselves inside the Qibli Mosque, one of two main prayer halls in the compound, in an effort to stay there overnight.\n\nThe raid outraged Palestinians and Muslims across the Middle East and prompted armed groups in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon to fire rockets at Israel. Israel launched airstrikes it said targeted the armed groups in southern Lebanon as well as at Hamas military sites in Gaza.\n\nJews revere the compound as the Temple Mount, the location of two ancient temples, considering it the holiest site in Judaism.

"High stock valuations suggest investors think the US economy will avoid recession, but expecting more equity gains is a stretch, Barclays says The S&P 500 is up about 18% from its October lows, getting close to reach bull-market status.\n\nBut Barclays says ""the bull case for equities, like valuations, is still a stretch.""\n\nEarnings estimates are still high for an economy that\'s unlikely to skirt a recession, the bank says.\n\nThe benchmark for the largest stocks in the US is knocking on the door of a bull market, hoisted from lows in part by investors optimistic about prospects for the economy. But Barclays says the case for a sustainable new bear market is a stretch for now.\n\nThe S&P 500 has crept up nearly 18% since hitting a low of 3,491.58 in October when investors shoved the index further into a bear market, shaken largely by the Federal Reserve\'s rapid rate hikes. It\'s gained more than 7% in 2023, fronted by a surge in the communications services, tech and consumer discretionary sectors.\n\n""Equities have thus far leapfrogged an improbable list of pitfalls, and every cleared hurdle may serve as another reason to risk buying a head fake if it means not missing the first step,"" Venu Krishna, head of US equities strategy at Barclays, wrote to clients in a research note published Monday.\n\n""However, we think we still have a ways to go before seeing the trough,"" he continued. ""Valuations can remain irrational for a time but earnings cannot, and if the history of recessionary bear markets (particularly high-inflationary ones) is a guide, both sides of the P/E multiple remain exposed to asymmetric downside risks.""\n\nStocks have pushed through stubborn inflation, the Fed\'s aggressive policy tightening, and -- so far -- the banking crisis that erupted out of last month\'s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. That sparked an indiscriminate flight to quality and market breadth deterioration, said Krishna.\n\nBut Barclays sees valuations as ""too optimistic"" relative to its base case for a shallow recession and $200 in per-share earnings collectively for S&P 500 companies in 2023.\n\nThere\'s a bull case to be made considering the S&P 500 is trading greater than 18.5 times consensus of 2023 per-share earnings and roughly 21 times the estimate held at Barclays, it said.\n\nInvestors are looking through an earnings contraction this year to an implied rebound in 2024 and positioning is making it ""far more punitive"" to be late than early. Mutual funds and hedge funds, for example, were caught sharply underweight the tech sector ahead of the recent flight-to-quality moves.\n\nBut with a recession looming, Barclays said it\'s confident the majority of cuts in next twelve months earnings estimates are still on the way.\n\nMeanwhile, the market is still pricing in a ""no landing"" scenario, an outlook that sees the Fed bringing inflation to or near its 2% target while the economy skirts a recession and recovers strongly next year.\n\n""This is the outcome that best supports current consensus, and we just don\'t see it,"" said Krishna.\n\n""Ultimately, we think the bull case for equities, like valuations, is still a stretch,"" he said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-stock-valuations-suggest-investors-040423878.html"

"Analysis: Louisville bodycam footage shows the tragic and brutal reality of policing in America This is what it means to serve and protect in a nation awash in guns.\n\nHarrowing, yet humbling, body camera footage of two Louisville officers who rushed into gunfire in Kentucky on Monday shows the demands placed upon police who respond to America\'s proliferating mass shootings and the terrible price they may pay.\n\nVideo of what is effectively a street battle more akin to a foreign war zone than a US city basking in the morning sunshine offers a visceral antidote to the collective national shoulder shrug that often follows gun massacres.\n\nThis is a raw, frightening scene, laced with courage and heroism. It offers a reality check about what unfolds in moments of terror and leaves the regular post-massacre political rituals of ""thoughts and prayers"" and doomed calls for gun reform looking empty by comparison.\n\nSome might question the need for Americans to see this disturbing footage. But it offers context to the bitter and often futile public debate about to how to stop mass shootings and helps the public understand the horror they involve.\n\nThe breathtaking video shows rookie Officer Nickolas Wilt driving up to the scene with his training officer, Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. After they take fire coming from inside the bank, Wilt slams the car into reverse before getting out with his handgun. Galloway races to the trunk to retrieve his service rifle. Then, without hesitating, they both advance up a set of steps – despite having no idea where the shooter, who turned out to be lying in wait, actually was. Suddenly, Galloway is down on the ground, with a minor gunshot wound after a deafening burst of fire. Wilt, who is blurred in the footage, lies shot in the head – another victim of the weapons of war that are often the preferred choice of mass killers. He is a good guy with a gun who was outgunned by a bad guy with a more powerful weapon.\n\nGalloway scrambles for some cover, and then is heard talking to other officers as they try to get a fix on the shooter\'s position – behind the glare of glass that means he can see them but they can\'t see him. Galloway, focused and in command, strategizes on how to challenge the shooter again and how to aid the fallen Wilt.\n\nActing quickly is critical. And in a volley of shots, the shooter makes a fatal error, breaking a window in the bank, where four victims already lay dead and one mortally wounded. This gives Galloway a sightline. He shoots and yells, ""I think he\'s down … get the officer!"" referring to Wilt, his trainee, who was shot on only his fourth time out on patrol. He\'s in the hospital in critical condition.\n\n""What you saw in that video was absolutely amazing. It\'s tragic but it\'s absolutely amazing,"" Deputy Louisville Police Chief Paul Humphrey said, when he released the video.\n\n""There\'s only a few people in this country that can do what they did. Not everybody can do that.""\n\nAn urgent response\n\nThe Louisville footage was aired two weeks after police in Nashville showed video of police rushing into a school in a courageous effort to stop a shooter who had killed six people, including three nine-year-olds. Both sequences from these recent mass shootings contrasted with footage of police at a mass shooting in a school in Uvalde, Texas, last year where 19 children and two adults died.\n\nWhile the circumstances aren\'t directly comparable, the picture in Nashville and Louisville was of urgency and a need to take down the assailant before more people died – in line with police training for such situations. In Texas last year, the footage showed poor communication, confusion and delay among officers in an operation since criticized by parents and authorities.\n\nAs long as America\'s incessant cycle of mass shootings goes on – and there\'s no sign it\'s ending – police will be called to respond. The political system is deadlocked on the issue. Calls for more investment in mental health after such killings never seem to materialize on a scale that might stop the tragedies. And many gun enthusiasts seem to prioritize their right to bear arms over the life and liberty of people gunned down by high-powered firearms.\n\nThe inability of politicians to act is a contrast to the courage of those two officers in Louisville.\n\n""It\'s just a tragic and brutal aspect of law enforcement in America. Officer Wilt tries to do his job and he is struck down in the course of trying to protect others,"" former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told CNN\'s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday.\n\n""It\'s remarkable, heart-pounding, terrifying video to watch. But once again, we have seen an act of incredible heroism that likely saved many lives.""\n\nThere is increasing frustration among some police leaders about the risks their officers face while national and state leaders resist changes to gun laws.\n\nThen-Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2022, ""We are out outgunned, we\'re outmanned, we\'re out-staffed, we do need responsible gun legislation.""\n\nAnd Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told CNN why his officers have to continue to train for active shooter situations. ""We don\'t want it to happen. Statistics tell us it will happen,"" he said. ""And this is where we do challenge our leaders at a national level, to do more about guns, to do more about mental health so that we don\'t have to do this over and over.""\n\nA contrasting picture of police bodycam footage\n\nThe images that have emerged in recent weeks of brave police officers selflessly rushing into danger are different from what Americans may be used to seeing on TV. The police bodycam footage that\'s often gained the most attention has shown just the opposite – with scenes of police brutality. For example, the release of horrific officer and surveillance footage from the January arrest of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten by Memphis police officers and died later in the hospital, triggered national outrage.\n\nThe split screen is a reminder that while partisan politics often paints a simple impression of the state of policing in America, heroism and cruelty co-exist and reality is nuanced.\n\nFormer Philadelphia and Washington, DC, police chief Charles Ramsey told CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer that authorities had learned about the need to show the public what happened from camera footage as quickly as possible. ""I think that things have definitely changed in policing,"" he said.\n\nOf course, this was a situation that presented police in a positive light, so they had every reason to release it.\n\nBut the footage formed a heroic counterpoint to the depraved behavior of the shooter in Louisville, who live streamed on social media his rampage inside the bank.\n\nReferring to the bodycam footage, Humphrey said: ""I think you can see the tension in that video, you can understand the stress that those officers are going through. (The) response wasn\'t perfect, but it was exactly the response we needed.""\n\n""I think I would love to have either one of those officers ride with me any day. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/bodycam-footage-police-louisville-shooting/index.html"
"MBS Is to Blame for Saudi Arabia's Shame in Yemen It has taken eight years, cost more than 200,000 lives and drained the exchequer of tens of billions of dollars, but Mohammed bin Salman is hoping nobody will notice that his first foray into foreign policy has been an utter failure. As he seeks a peace with Yemen's Houthi militia, Saudi Arabia's crown prince and de facto ruler would prefer that we all pay attention to his growing stature as a player in international affairs.\n\nIn the Saudi telling of the tale, the prince is merely getting out of a minor entanglement, the better to engage with great-power geopolitics. Why spar with Shiite rebels over control of the kingdom's impoverished southern neighbor, when he can apply himself to matters of worldwide import, such as setting the price of oil and playing the US, China and Russia off each other? https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-12/mbs-is-to-blame-for-saudi-arabia-s-shame-in-yemen"
"The Xi-Macron Summit's Unexpected Payoff The most important diplomatic encounter in quite a while -- between President Emmanuel Macron of France and China\'s president, Xi Jinping -- turned out to be far less important than either side had hoped. Fortunately, it doesn\'t seem to have led to the sort of damage many in the US had feared.\n\nLast week\'s visit was billed as a potential diplomatic breakthrough, in which the charismatic Frenchman would charm the Chinese leader into pushing his ""no limits"" friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, into peace negotiations over the war in Ukraine. Xi, on the other hand, likely hoped to create division in the Western alliance and build a much stronger bilateral relationship with France. Yet the visit appears to have yielded nothing substantial, and left a number of unanswered questions in its wake. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-12/xi-macron-summit-china-didn-t-divide-the-pro-ukraine-alliance"
"Central Bank Hawks Had Better Hope the IMF Is Wrong About Rates The International Monetary Fund has caused some consternation with the long-range forecasts in its April World Economic Outlook. It predicts that once the current bout of nasty global inflation abates, interest rates will return close to zero.

"Silicon Valley VCs tour Middle East in hunt for funding Silicon Valley investors are touring the Middle East, seeking to build long-term ties with sovereign wealth funds during the worst funding crunch for venture capital firms in almost a decade.\n\nTop technology VCs such as Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global and IVP have jetted teams of executives to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the trips.\n\nThese visits come after their traditional North American and European backers contend with an economic downturn that has forced them to rein in private investments.\n\nVCs are, in turn, being encouraged to come to the region, as Gulf officials and young royals seek to diversify their economy away from petrochemicals with investments into hot tech sectors such as artificial intelligence.\n\nThat has also meant that some VCs have quietly reversed earlier decisions to refuse meetings with, or cash from, politically controversial nations such as Saudi Arabia.\n\n""We came to San Francisco looking for them in 2017. Now . . . everyone is coming to [us],"" said Ibrahim Ajami, head of ventures at Mubadala Capital, a $6bn arm of Abu Dhabi\'s $790bn sovereign wealth fund. ""The tech correction has humbled the industry.""\n\nThe Financial Times interviewed more than a dozen Silicon Valley VCs who control tens of billions of dollars between them, as well as a string of advisers and bankers. They describe a new love affair between US venture funds and Middle Eastern cash.\n\nA group of Silicon Valley executives received a personal invite from the office of Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of PIF, the $620bn Saudi sovereign wealth fund, to be his guest at last month\'s Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jeddah, according to a person with knowledge of the calls.\n\nAmong the attendees, according to the person, was Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz -- the veteran financier\'s second trip to Saudi Arabia in less than six months. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment.\n\nPIF\'s venture arm Sanabil recently disclosed its partnerships with nearly 40 US venture firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue Management, David Sacks\' Craft Ventures, Insight Partners and 9Yards Capital, where former UK chancellor George Osborne is a managing partner. The sums invested in the firms were not revealed.\n\nHorowitz, whose San Francisco-based firm raised just over $14bn last year, in particular has become a vocal supporter of Saudi interest in tech innovation.\n\nIn October, he spoke at the ""Davos in the desert"" conference in Riyadh and had lunch with Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, the Saudi ambassador to the US. At a conference organised by PIF last month in Miami, he praised the kingdom as a ""start-up country"" and likened its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to a company founder.\n\nA year ago, Horowitz\'s trips to Saudi Arabia would have been an anomaly among VCs flush with cash and keen to avoid the moral predicament of dealing with states with poor human rights records. Now the Middle East is buzzing with US start-up investors, according to several people who have visited there this year.\n\n""The Four Seasons in Riyadh is basically Palo Alto,"" said a partner at one large Silicon Valley venture fund.\n\nThat willingness to do business in the region has led to some criticism. Founders Fund partner Keith Rabois, who said in 2018 that Silicon Valley had been hypocritical for accepting Saudi money, said, ""I don\'t change my values and principles because a funding environment is difficult.""\n\nBut Lead Edge founder Mitchell Green, who made venture investments in Alibaba and Uber, said he had spent the past few weeks ""building long-term relationships"" with people and companies in the Middle East. ""We think it will become an increasingly important area of the world over the next decade. It reminds us of going to China in 2003.""\n\nTiger Global partner Scott Shleifer also spoke at the Riyadh conference in October, and the firm has been pursuing investment from the kingdom as part of its latest $6bn fundraising, according to people familiar with the matter. A team from IVP, one of Silicon Valley\'s oldest venture firms, led by partner Somesh Dash, went on a tour of the region, according to one person with knowledge of the trip. IVP declined to comment.\n\nUS venture capital has exploded in size in recent years, in part fuelled by a boom in tech valuations during the coronavirus pandemic. Marquee funds that once prized exclusivity, such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, have raised funds of as much as $5bn and sometimes as large as $9bn. That shift has been intensified by large entrants to the market, such as Japan\'s SoftBank and Tiger Global, which have deployed tens of billions of dollars into start-ups.\n\n""These guys have built their models on high-volume, high-velocity investors -- now they are a prisoner to the capital cycle,"" said a partner at a venture fund with more than $4bn under management.\n\nDealing with nations such as Saudi Arabia is the ""Faustian bargain these firms have made by scaling up"", the partner added. ""They went for ubiquity and market share and gave up on scarcity, and because of that they have to play the game of selling themselves. Venture capital went from being the Hermès Birkin bag of investing to Target.""\n\nPIF, in particular, has gradually permeated US tech through its investments over the past decade. It contributed $45bn to the $100bn SoftBank Vision Fund in 2016. It has made large direct investments in US tech companies, including a $3.5bn investment in Uber in 2016 and more than $1bn in electric-car maker Lucid Motors in 2018. That same year, Elon Musk said he was in talks with PIF to help him fund a $72bn deal to take Tesla private, although a deal did not materialise.\n\nIn the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives in late 2018, a number of high-profile western businesses, including many tech investors, stopped publicly working with the country.\n\nThat continued until the recent economic downturn, which has meant pools of capital available for venture funds at large western institutions have dried up. Fundraising by venture capital firms hit a nine-year low at the end of 2022, according to research firm Preqin.\n\nVCs are sitting on a record $300bn of ""dry powder"" -- money raised that has not yet been deployed. But many are struggling to find lucrative investments in start-ups and will be unable to raise a new venture fund.\n\nCash that VCs put into start-ups has plunged more than 50 per cent over the past 12 months, according to data provider Crunchbase.\n\nAs a result, many have been lured back to the Middle East, which ""is the most liquid place on the planet right now"", according to the head of a $1bn venture fund.\n\n""This is a unique opportunity for funds like Mubadala to really take a leading role in the development of technology over the next 20 years,"" Ajami said.

""The US is buying oil from Saudi, we\'re selling them drones, where do you draw the line?"" said one venture capitalist, who admitted they had shifted from a stance of never accepting Saudi money to being more open to it as fundraising had dried up.\n\nFor others, particularly those who control smaller funds and therefore have still been able to tap up western pension and endowment funds, the issue is more black and white.\n\n""I\'ve been in the Valley for 20 years and I\'m increasingly disappointed with the way we behave,"" said one senior banker who handles deals for venture firms.

"As the west tries to limit TikTok's reach, what about China's other apps? As TikTok, the world\'s most popular app, comes under increasing scrutiny in response to data privacy and security concerns, lawmakers in the west may soon set their sights on other Chinese platforms that have gone global.\n\nTikTok was built by ByteDance as a foreign version of its popular domestic video-sharing platform, Douyin. But it is far from being ByteDance\'s only overseas moneymaker. The Chinese company owns dozens of apps that are available overseas, many of them English-language versions of Chinese offerings.\n\nCapCut is a video-editing app that is used by TikTok creators, while Lark is a workplace collaboration platform. Other apps, particularly e-commerce platforms such as Shein, have become hugely popular in the US and the UK.\n\nThe US Congress is now considering the introduction of the Restrict Act, which would give the commerce department the power to ban TikTok and other apps that pose national security risks. Because the main concern about Chinese apps is that they are subject to interference from the Chinese Communist party, many household names could soon be in the line of fire.\n\nCapCut is the Chinese version of ByteDance\'s JianYing. It was the fourth-most downloaded app globally in 2022, behind TikTok, Instagram and WhatsApp, according to Statista, which analyses market and consumer data.\n\nDespite the security concerns over TikTok, governments have said little about CapCut. India\'s government is an outlier, banning the app in 2020 along with a host of others made by Chinese companies.\n\nFirst released in April 2020, CapCut has been downloaded more than 500m times on the Google Play store globally. On Apple devices, it was downloaded 25m times just last month, according to data analysts Sensor Tower. At times in 2021, CapCut was the most downloaded free app in the US.\n\nLark, a workplace collaboration platform, launched in 2019. Its Chinese version is called Feishu, but the two platforms operate and store data separately, with Lark being managed from Singapore.\n\nIt has already launched in the US, south-east Asia and Japan, and has plans to expand into Europe. Its target audience is multinational companies that work with China, or Chinese companies working overseas.\n\nLark combines elements of Slack, Dropbox, Google Docs and Skype. It is a minnow compared with ByteDance\'s other products, but is part of a strategy to diversify the company\'s offering.\n\nNow, however, Lark\'s future looks uncertain. It explicitly deals with the kind of proprietary data that western lawmakers and companies would want to keep secure. Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst who previously worked for tech firm Alibaba, said that, for years, Chinese apps pursued a strategy of developing ""under the radar"" before being discovered more widely. But, Yang said, ""that trajectory has to shift because the American government doesn\'t allow them to do that any more"".\n\nTencent\'s WeChat – which has more than 1.1 billion users – is overwhelmingly used in China, where the all-encompassing app is essential for communications, bookings, finances, and even health monitoring during the pandemic.\n\nBut it is popular in other countries, too, particularly for diaspora communities wanting to keep in touch with friends and family back in China. Disinformation is particularly rife on WeChat, in part because news spreads in private chat groups rather than on public feeds, so is harder to monitor.\n\nIn 2022, it was downloaded more than 66m times in China, about 2.1m times in both the US and Indonesia, and more than 1m times in Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.\n\nIn September 2020, the then US president, Donald Trump, sought to ban WeChat and TikTok outright. This led to lawsuits and court-ordered stays on the ban, and in 2021 his successor, Joe Biden, withdrew Trump\'s executive orders. Biden\'s administration also launched national security reviews of apps created by companies with links to adversarial foreign governments such as China.\n\nWeChat is a Chinese-made app also used in the west, unlike TikTok, CapCut and others, which are western versions of Chinese apps. In 2021, WeChat said it had separated processes for its domestic Chinese users and those who log in with a foreign phone number.\n\nBut in September last year, overseas users received pop-up messages warning them that ""personal data [including] likes, comments, browsing and search history, content uploads, etc"" would be stored on Chinese servers.\n\nShein, pronounced ""shee-in"", is the world\'s largest fashion retailer. Founded in 2008 in Nanjing, last year it was the most-downloaded fashion and beauty app in the US, with more than 27m downloads, according to Statista.\n\nSign up to TechScape\n\nAlex Hern\'s weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nConsumers are turning to Shein because it is cheap. But, said Yang, it is also ""a lot more fun"". Chinese e-commerce apps are ""a lot more engaging"", with pop-ups offering discounts and deals to gamify the shopping experience.\n\nDespite the cheap prices, its revenues are huge. In 2022, it raked in $22.7bn (£18.2bn), putting it in the same league as established behemoths such as H&M and Zara. Rui Ma, a China tech analyst and investor, said that Shein\'s core advantage was its supply chain. Unlike other fashion companies, Shein works directly with the material suppliers and factories, so it has a detailed understanding of its own pipeline. Ma said Shein\'s inventory waste ""is one-10th that of the industry average"", which allowed it to keep prices down.\n\nTemu only launched in the US in September 2022, but by January this year it was the most popular app in the country. The e-commerce platform sells everything from wireless earphones for $5.09 to a cat\'s toothbrush for $0.44.\n\nIts inventory is a core part of its business model: it prioritises lightweight products to reduce cargo costs, and ships to consumers directly from factories in China. This allows it to offer rock-bottom prices. It also requires vendors to offer products that are not available on other platforms.\n\nIt is a subsidiary of PDD Holdings Inc, a Chinese company that also owns the Chinese internet retailer Pinduoduo. Pinduoduo is the dark horse of the Chinese e-commerce market. Despite being much younger than Alibaba and JD.com, which dominate the industry, Pinduoduo has about 15% of the market share. Ma said PDD had ""a team that is really good at execution, and they\'re taking a lot of the Chinese advantages, and their knowhow, into expanding abroad"".\n\nYang also notes that with US consumers being increasingly cash-strapped, they are willing to wait longer – Temu\'s delivery times can be one to two weeks – for cheaper products. That is a challenge for US giants such as Amazon, which have prioritised speed of delivery above all else.\n\nLast year AliExpress, the online marketplace of the tech giant Alibaba, was the third-most popular marketplace app in the UK, with 1m downloads, behind Amazon and eBay. Rather than working directly with factories, it connects small businesses in China with consumers around the world to sell cheap products, often in bulk.\n\nHowever, despite being backed by China\'s leading e-commerce platform, AliExpress has failed to catch on in the west as successfully as newer rivals such as Temu and Shein. Yang said part of the reason for this was that it didn\'t have the ""laser focus"" of its competitors. Yang said that AliExpress ""was never really under pressure to thrive"" in the west because Alibaba already had so many arms to its business, including Taobao, for shopping, and Alipay, a mobile payments system that is ubiquitous in China.\n\nIn theory, many of the accusations that have been levelled against TikTok – such as that it is bad for children\'s mental health or engages in censorship of political topics – should be less applicable to other Chinese apps that are popular in the west. Fast fashion and cheap cosmetics are less controversial than algorithmically delivered content that is seen as shaping young minds. And shopping apps like Temu and Shein are dependent on physical supply chains, so they are less able to change or mask their Chinese links.\n\nBut US lawmakers have warned that any Chinese-owned apps could be vulnerable to data privacy breaches or interference from the Chinese Communist party.\n\nSome analysts have pointed out that the US does not have comprehensive data privacy laws, meaning that users of any apps have little control over how their data is used.\n\nMa said: ""It doesn\'t make much sense to me that a shopping app is going to be put on the same level [of scrutiny] as a media app. But my view is that it\'s not going to stop anyone from trying. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/12/tiktok-china-apps-national-security-wechat-shein"

"Trump dismisses criticisms about Biden's age, saying when people 'do the age thing' they're coming after him as well Former President Donald Trump downplayed concerns about age during an interview -- the first since his historic arraignment last week -- that aired Tuesday saying President Joe Biden, who\'s less than four years older than him, has other problems.\n\nTrump, who is 76, told Fox News host Tucker Carlson plenty of people in their 80s and 90s are sharp, noting Sen. Bernie Sanders, the 81-year-old progressive from Vermont.\n\n""Bernie\'s older than Biden. Whether you like him or not, he\'s 100% sharp,"" Trump said of his fellow 2016 presidential candidate, adding ""so it\'s not an age thing.""\n\nThe former president also complimented Bernie Marcus -- the conservative co-founder of Home Depot who claimed ""nobody works"" anymore because of socialism -- by saying ""he was 100%"" while pointing his own head.\n\nTrump also levied criticisms at President Joe Biden, saying he could not see Biden running for president in 2024 -- but made clear that he did not think what was ""wrong"" with Biden had anything to do with him being 80 years old.\n\n""I think they do the age thing because I\'m 4-5 years behind. They say \'this is a way of getting Trump,\'"" he said.\n\nAs voters look to see if Biden -- the oldest sitting president -- will run for a second presidential term, his age has been brought up as a way to question whether he is fit to serve in public office.\n\nPast polls have found that a majority of Americans think both Biden and Trump are too old to seek reelection -- although Trump is doing just that with his 2024 presidential bid.\n\nIn October, Biden addressed the concerns, saying they were ""legitimate"" but said that voters should judge him not by his age, but by his health.\n\n""I think the best way to make the judgment is to watch me. Am I slowing up? Am I going at the same pace?"" Biden told MSNBC\'s Jonathan Capehart.\n\nRepresentatives for Sanders and the White House did not immediately respond to Insider\'s request for comment. https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-downplays-age-issues-calls-bernie-sanders-bernie-marcus-sharp-2023-4"

"AI imagines Renaissance Architecture as Footwear to create absolutely stunning new styles - Yanko Design Putting soul and sole together…\n\nWith the kind of attention to detail that only AI can come up with, these shoes are an avant-garde combination of two industries that have very little of an overlap. Envisioned by AI-artist Str4ngeThing, the footwear, which range in a variety of styles, capture architectural and artistic expressions and details from Renaissance Architecture. The results are absolutely stunning, even though impractical. They are, however, ""a testament to the power of design and innovation using AI,"" according to the designer.\n\nDesigner: Str4ngeThing\n\nThese heels use a combination of floral motifs and traditional Renaissance spires and towers\n\nLooking like it\'s made using a combination of thin-sliced wood veneer or cork, these shoes have an immense amount of detail in them. While footwear design usually sticks to a ""less is more"" agenda, these shoes are the absolute antithesis to the fact. Chuck Taylors are iconic for their simplicity, so are Crocs, and Christian Louboutins… but these Renaissance Footwear concepts aren\'t. Every shoe compresses an entire era of iconic architecture into its small \'footprint\'. Sure, the AI loses some crucial details and makes a few assumptions while generating the images, but the results look marvelous no less.\n\nA classic interpretation of the Italian Renaissance, this mocassin features arched windows like the ones seen in Roman architecture\n\nSome shoes go a step further by including sculptural elements in their details like the one above. The tongue of the shoe, right near the shin, looks like a grotesque – a key element of Renaissance and even medieval architecture. The midsole area has some wonderful detailing, while the entire shoe looks like it was carved from sandstone. The shoe concept below is a stunning example of grandiosity, with an entire relief mural \'carved\' into the side of the stone. The top of the shoe is an interpretation of the highly detailed Corinthian-style orders seen at the top of architectural columns. Is it practical? Absolutely not. Is it awe-striking? Undeniably.\n\n""This collection is also a true testament to the importance of creativity and innovation in the world of fashion. It demonstrates that with a forward-thinking approach and a commitment to excellence, it is possible to create something truly exceptional,"" says designer Str4ngeThing.\n\nNot all footwear designs get the balance between different aesthetic elements right, though… like the proportions between architecture and human sculpture.\n\nThe shoe concept above goes way beyond architecture and builds an entire diorama on the footwear body. Although it isn\'t perfect, you can see the Roman columns, the angled roofs of the Pantheon-style building, and the environments around it. The footwear below feels like a fresco brought to life, almost like Michelangelo made the footwear himself.\n\nThe AI has a long way to go in making concepts that are feasible, but at least in its current stage, Midjourney\'s images are about as stunningly hyperrealistic as they can be. ""I\'m excited to see how this collection will inspire and influence the world of fashion, and I\'m proud to have played a part in bringing it to life,"" Str4ngeThing mentions in his Instagram post. https://www.yankodesign.com/2023/04/11/ai-imagines-renaissance-architecture-as-footwear-to-create-absolutely-stunning-new-styles/"

"Everything you need to know about BabyAGI - TechStory In recent months, we have seen the emergence and proliferation of several artificial intelligence systems worldwide, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Google's Bard. Microsoft's new Bing and Baidu's Ernie Bot have also entered the scene. Joining this group of AI systems is a newcomer known as BabyAGI.\n\nBabyAGI is an innovative AI platform designed to train and evaluate various AI agents in a simulated environment. The AI is a pared-down version of the original Task-Driven Autonomous Agent developed and launched by VC and AI expert Yohei Nakajima.\n\nWhat sets Baby AGI apart from other AI tools is its advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, which have the potential to outperform existing AI offerings, including those developed by Google and OpenAI.\n\nThe democratization of AI technology, the versatility of Baby AGI in various industries, and its role in accelerating the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) further underscore its significance in the AI world.\n\nBabyAGI is an open-source platform that draws inspiration from the cognitive development of human infants to facilitate research in various fields, including reinforcement learning, language learning, and cognitive development.\n\nThe platform aims to train and evaluate various AI agents in a simulated environment and test their ability to learn and perform complex tasks. The significance of reinforcement learning and cognitive development is high in this AI system as it is designed to test and improve the performance of AI agents.\n\nWoah!@yoheinakajima's just open-sourced his  Baby #AGI  project, a powerful  Task-Driven Autonomous Agent  leveraging #GPT4, @Pinecone's Vector Search, and @LangChainAI to autonomously create & perform tasks in   100 lines of code!  \n\nCheck out the link to the repos below   pic.twitter.com/tEMniFgYQV\n\n-- DataChazGPT   (not a bot) (@DataChaz) April 3, 2023\n\nThe system uses powerful technologies such as GPT-4, LangChain's chain and agent capabilities, OpenAI's API, and Pinecone to enable efficient task completion, generation of new tasks, prioritization of tasks, and storage of task results. With its focus on reinforcement learning, language\n\nThe system employs OpenAI's GPT-4 language model, which is responsible for completing tasks, generating new tasks based on completed results, and prioritizing tasks in real-time. This powerful text-based LLM (Language Model) forms the core of the system.\n\nThe system also utilizes Pinecone, a vector search platform, to efficiently store and retrieve task-related data such as task descriptions, constraints, and results. Pinecone's storage capabilities are critical for the system's efficient reinforcement learning capacity.\n\nTo enhance Baby AGI's capabilities, the system integrates the LangChain framework, which allows the AI agent to be data-aware and interact with its environment. This interaction results in a more powerful and differentiated system, particularly in task completion and agent-based decision-making processes.\n\nBaby AGI's task management is crucial for the system's functioning. The system maintains a task list represented by a deque (double-ended queue) data structure. The task list is used to manage and prioritize tasks, and the system autonomously creates new tasks based on completed results. The system reprioritizes the task list accordingly to ensure efficient task completion.\n\nThe BabyAGI script runs in an infinite loop, constantly pulling tasks from a task list, executing them, enriching the results, and creating new tasks based on the objective and the result of the previous task. The script's workflow can be divided into four main steps: task execution, result enrichment, task creation, and task prioritization.\n\nThis is the first step of the BabyAGI workflow. In this step, the execution agent function sends a task to OpenAI's API, which completes the task based on the context. The execution agent function takes two parameters: the objective and the task.\n\nIt then sends a prompt to OpenAI's API, which returns the result of the task as a string. This step is significant because it allows the system to complete tasks and gather data that will inform the creation of new tasks and the prioritization of existing tasks.\n\nIn the result enrichment step, the previous task's outcome is enhanced and saved in Pinecone, a useful tool for storing and retrieving task results for contextual reference. The script sets up a Pinecone index based on the table name defined in the YOUR_TABLE_NAME variable.\n\nUsing Pinecone, the script saves the task outcome in the index, including the task name and any other relevant metadata. This step is essential because it enables the system to learn from previous experiences and continuously enhance its performance. By keeping track of past outcomes and their associated metadata, BabyAGI can identify patterns, learn from mistakes, and optimize its performance in subsequent tasks.\n\nThe third step of the BabyAGI workflow is task creation, which involves the task creation agent function utilizing OpenAI's API to create new tasks based on the objective and the outcome of the previous task.\n\nBy providing four parameters, including the objective, result of the previous task, task description, and current task list, the function sends a prompt to OpenAI's API, which returns a list of new tasks as strings. The new tasks are then returned as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the name of the task.\n\nThis step is significant as it enables the system to continuously adapt to evolving objectives and contexts by generating new tasks. This also ensures that the system does not become stagnant and is consistently challenged to improve its performance.\n\nTask prioritization –\n\nThe final step in the BabyAGI workflow is task prioritization. Here, the prioritization agent function employs OpenAI's API to prioritize the task list. The function accepts the ID of the current task as a parameter.\n\nUpon sending a prompt to OpenAI's API, the function receives a numbered list of reprioritized tasks. This step plays a crucial role in ensuring that the system continually focuses on tasks that are important and relevant to the objective.\n\nBaby-AGI by @yoheinakajima is taking the world by storm\n\nHere's an implementation within the @LangChainAI framework, allowing you to easily substitute in other vectorstores and other LLMs\n\nDocs: https://t.co/LK7juyVLYg pic.twitter.com/QUfmfagaNx\n\n-- Harrison Chase (@hwchase17) April 10, 2023\n\nHow to install Baby AGI\n\nAs AI systems continue to evolve, the emergence of BabyAGI is poised to have a significant impact on the development and research of generative artificial intelligence systems. The continued development and improvement of BabyAGI will undoubtedly spur further advancements in the field of AI, with wide-ranging applications in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, among others. https://techstory.in/everything-you-need-to-know-about-babyagi/"
"Brains trust: Aussie and US scientists combine smarts to tackle global challenges - CSIRO 20 February 2023 News Release\n\nClimate change, clean energy and sustainability, building low emissions technologies and developing ethical artificial intelligence are some of the challenges being tackled by CSIRO, Australia\'s national science agency, and the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) under a multi-million-dollar partnership.\n\nThe recently established partnership between the two leading science organisations is aiming to accelerate joint research and initiatives in areas of mutual priority between Australia and the United States.\n\nCSIRO Chief Executive Larry Marshall said the two leading science organisations have already enabled a number of opportunities across the two countries in only a year, launching this month an AUD$100 million Global Centers initiative, partnering in the areas of responsible and ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) and developing sustainable materials for global challenges.\n\n""As national science agencies, CSIRO and the NSF are working together to build international bridges for national benefit, strengthening our science and innovation to improve lives around the world,"" Dr Marshall said.\n\n""As the world races towards new applications for technologies like AI, it will take global collaboration to champion responsible and ethical applications that embrace the full potential of technological advances and drive healthy competitive advantages.\n\n""CSIRO is proud to stand side-by-side with the NSF, committed to responsible and ethical AI not only through our own research, but by catalysing new opportunities across the ecosystem,"" he said.\n\nThree Australia-US teams were announced today as beneficiaries of the responsible and ethical AI grants totalling US$1.8 million from NSF and AUD$2.3 million from CSIRO, with the projects aligned to CSIRO\'s Missions, including:\n\nNSF Director, Sethuraman Panchanathan, currently meeting researchers in Australia, said the CSIRO-NSF partnership was already showing early impact.\n\n""Through this collaboration we\'re building a platform to mobilise the resources and capabilities of the research communities across the United States and Australia to address things which are a priority for both our counties but also the world, like climate resilience and unbiased AI-powered technologies,"" Dr Panchanathan said.\n\n""With this collaboration also comes the opportunity to unlock our \'missing millions\' – the untapped resource of those who are yet to be engaged for the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce who can provide diverse thinking and ideas,"" he said.\n\nCSIRO, this month, joined as an anchor partner in the NSF Global Centres in Climate Change and Clean Energy, involving the United States (NSF); Canada (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada); the United Kingdom (UK Research and Innovation); and Australia (CSIRO).\n\nThe Global Centres, with combined funding of more than AUD$100 million across the four partner countries, are supporting international, interdisciplinary collaborative research centres to bring together the brightest minds from across the globe to address the most pressing challenges the world faces today.

"The frequency architecture of brain and brain body oscillations: an analysis - PMC Research on brain oscillations has brought up a picture of coupled oscillators. Some of the most important questions that will be analyzed are, how many frequencies are there, what are the coupling principles, what their functional meaning is, and whether body oscillations follow similar coupling principles. It is argued that physiologically, two basic coupling principles govern brain as well as body oscillations: (i) amplitude (envelope) modulation between any frequencies m and n, where the phase of the slower frequency m modulates the envelope of the faster frequency n, and (ii) phase coupling between m and n, where the frequency of n is a harmonic multiple of m. An analysis of the center frequency of traditional frequency bands and their coupling principles suggest a binary hierarchy of frequencies. This principle leads to the foundation of the binary hierarchy brain body oscillation theory. Its central hypotheses are that the frequencies of body oscillations can be predicted from brain oscillations and that brain and body oscillations are aligned to each other. The empirical evaluation of the predicted frequencies for body oscillations is discussed on the basis of findings for heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing frequencies, fluctuations in the BOLD signal, and other body oscillations. The conclusion is that brain and many body oscillations can be described by a single system, where the cross talk – reflecting communication – within and between brain and body oscillations is governed by m : n phase to envelope and phase to phase coupling. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6668003/"
"How Alexandr Wang Turned An Army Of Clickworkers Into A $7.3 Billion AI Unicorn IN2018, ON A TRIP to his ancestral homeland, Alexandr Wang listened as China\'s brightest engineers gave impressive presentations on artificial intelligence. He found it odd that the researchers conspicuously avoided any mention of how AI might be used. Wang, whose immigrant parents were nuclear physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where the first atomic bombs were designed, was unsettled.\n\n""They were really dodgy on what the use cases were. You could tell it was for no good,"" recalls Wang, the cofounder of Scale AI, who has no second ""e"" in his first name so that it has eight characters, a number associated with good fortune in Chinese culture. Scale was then an up-and-coming startup providing data services primarily to self-driving auto-makers. But Wang began to worry that AI might soon upend a world order that, excepting the fall of the Soviet Union, has remained mostly stable since World War II. ""If you think about the history of humanity, it\'s mostly been punctuated by war except the last 80 or so years, which have been unusually peaceful,"" he says from Scale\'s sixth-floor headquarters in downtown San Francisco, as the occasional (partly) self-driving car zips by below. ""A lot of that has been because of American leadership in the world.""\n\nAt first glance, Wang, 26, exudes the skittish energy of a fresh college graduate. He listens to ""sad girl"" musicians like Gracie Abrams and Billie Eilish and dresses ""gorpcore,"" an in-vogue style of fashionable hiking clothes. He posts Instagram photos with actor Kiernan Shipka of Mad Men fame and spouts pithy nuggets on Twitter: ""The best problems can only be solved by blood, sweat, tears, spirit and an overwhelming sense of purpose,"" he wrote in one February tweet. At bars, he still gets carded regularly.\n\nNone of that matters in Silicon Valley and D.C., where he\'s already a power player. His rise began with a bet he made in 2016 to ""label"" the mass of data required to power AI, primarily for self-driving cars. Someone needed to train the AI to know the difference between a paper bag and a pedestrian. He cornered that market and put Scale in a good position in another sector: generative AI. It was a prescient move that helped him garner a client list that includes the biggest names in AI--and the U.S. government.\n\nYoung and Younger   Wang was just 19 when he started Scale. His cofounder, Lucy Guo, was 21. ""It definitely made it harder to hire,"" Wang says. ""There was somebody who asked me, \'Explain to me why I should entrust my career to you.\' ""\n\n""We\'re the picks and shovels in the generative AI gold rush,"" he says. It has quickly become a lucrative business for Scale, which says it pulled in $250 million in revenue last year, at a time when many AI startups aren\'t yet making a cent. Its tech has been used by the government to analyze satellite imagery in Ukraine and by OpenAI to create ChatGPT, the bot that rocked the world with its ability to answer trivia and write poetry. Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of cloud software giant Salesforce, likens Scale\'s rise to that of cloud computing darlings Snowflake and Datadog. Former Amazon consumer boss Jeff Wilke, one of Wang\'s most trusted advisors, takes an even more enthusiastic view: Scale could become the Amazon Web Services of AI.\n\nInvestors awarded Scale a $7.3 billion valuation in 2021, making Wang the latest Silicon Valley insta-billionaire. But his fortune wasn\'t built entirely on silicon. It was also built with a vast outsourced workforce that performs a rudimentary task crucial to AI: labeling the data used to train it. Those people--some 240,000 of them in countries including Kenya, the Philippines and Venezuela--work for Remotasks, a subsidiary Scale doesn\'t mention in public marketing materials. In other words, if AI does someday liberate humans from mundane workplace tasks, it will have done so using a legion of workers in the Global South, many of whom are paid less than $1 an hour.\n\n""They\'re very, very important to the process of building powerful AI systems,"" Wang says of his Remotasks workers.\n\nScale was conceived as a one-stop shop for supplying human labor to perform tasks that could not be done by algorithms--essentially, the antithesis of AI.\n\nThey\'re also, increasingly, an ethical concern, with worries emerging about substandard working conditions and low pay. Meanwhile, competitors see Scale as a house of cards that has suffered layoffs and declining value on secondary markets in the past year that has stripped Wang of billionaire status. (Those markets now value his 15% stake at $630 million. Scale argues it\'s worth closer to $890 million.) ""Scale markets itself as a technology company,"" says Manu Sharma, cofounder of rival startup Labelbox. ""For us, they\'re no different than any business-process outsourcing company."" Tech upstarts think they can do what Scale does better, while traditional outsourcers think they can do it cheaper.\n\n""I would say that we\'ve been working on this problem longer and have built more technology than anyone else,"" Wang counters. He\'s trying to follow Amazon\'s playbook of managing the entire chain, from warehouses to shipping. For Scale, that means both the machines--which are increasingly automating the data work--and the human army, which is growing ever larger. ""We\'re always going to want a human in the loop,"" he says.\n\nBEFORE COLLEGE, Wang moved to the Bay Area to work for internet startup Quora, where CEO Adam D\'Angelo gave him a crucial piece of advice: Four years of college is overrated, two is underrated. In the end, Wang spent just one year at MIT before heading to storied startup accelerator Y Combinator. There he teamed up with Quora alum Lucy Guo, another dropout, to start Scale in 2016. He remembers being ""ridiculously young"" at the time, just 19. ""But I was just like, \'Yeah, I know how to code. We\'re going to go do this thing.\' ""\n\nAs it was first conceived, Scale was to be a one-stop shop for supplying human labor to perform tasks that could not be done by algorithms--essentially, the antithesis of AI. Accel partner Dan Levine was early to see its potential, offering the pair a seed investment of $4.5 million (and his basement as temporary headquarters) in July 2016. Within months, Wang and Guo realized Scale was a viable solution to a problem plaguing the self-driving car companies at AI\'s then-frontier: They had millions of miles of on-the-road driving footage with which to train their autonomous vehicle AI, and not nearly enough people to review and label it. Scale could fill that need.\n\nIn 2018, Wang and Guo were named to Forbes\' 30 Under 30 list in enterprise technology. Guo subsequently left the company ""due to differences in product vision and road map,"" she says. ""I think Alex has done a great job continuing to run the company."" Guo otherwise declined to comment for this story, and Wang declined to speak about their split.\n\nInvestor Mike Volpi first heard Scale\'s name during a 2018 board meeting for autonomous vehicle (AV) startup Aurora. ""Who?"" he remembers asking. Scale\'s data labeling service had become crucial for Aurora, he learned, just as it had for Uber and for General Motors\' self-driving subsidiary, Cruise. Volpi persuaded his firm, Index Ventures, to lead an $18 million investment in Scale that August, when its revenue was still shy of $3 million.\n\nThe AV wager was becoming a cash cow. Scale\'s client list now included major international auto manufacturers such as Toyota and Honda, as well as Silicon Valley behemoths like Google AV subsidiary Waymo, according to a June 2019 fundraising pitch deck seen by Forbes. An account with Apple\'s secretive self-driving unit alone was bringing in more than $10 million, the document said, putting annual revenue on track to surpass $40 million. (Scale declined to comment on the deck.)\n\nWhen Peter Thiel\'s Founders Fund made a $100 million investment that minted Scale as a Silicon Valley unicorn in August 2019, it kicked off a 20-month, $580 million fundraising spree, the final round of which valued the company north of $7 billion. It had taken Wang, then 24, just five years to become the youngest self-made billionaire in the world.\n\n""There is pretty much zero accountability for those working conditions.""\n\nBY THE TIME Scale dominated the data labeling market for self-driving car companies, its name had become something of an irony. The more it scaled, the harder it became to keep up with the demand for human labor. Wang first turned to outsourcing agencies to fill gaps, but costs quickly spiraled. Gross margins, which hovered at about 65% in early 2018, approached a mere 30% by the fourth quarter. Wang needed to stanch the bleeding while still capturing both the human and machine sides of the AI data training supply chain.\n\nEnter Remotasks, Scale\'s in-house outsourcing agency. Created in 2017, Remotasks soon became a priority as the company\'s AV business skyrocketed. In need of cheap labor, Scale set up a dozen-plus facilities in Southeast Asia and Africa to train thousands of data labelers. By mid-2019, Scale\'s margins had recovered to 69%, according to the deck.\n\nScale has been careful to position Remotasks as a separate brand. Its website makes no mention of Remotasks; the reverse is also true. Early employees say this was done to make Scale\'s strategy less obvious to competitors and shield the company from scrutiny. Scale told Forbes it separated the two brands for client confidentiality.\n\nIn a 2022 study into working conditions on 15 digital labor platforms, University of Oxford researchers concluded Remotasks met the ""minimum standards of fair work"" in just two of 10 criteria, flunking equitable pay--which early employees say is pennies per hour on average--and fair representation. They noted that the ""obfuscation"" of its association with Scale creates confusion that ""can contribute to workers\' vulnerability to exploitation."" Lead researcher Kelle Howson compared data labelers on digital labor services like Remotasks to garment factory workers in many of the same countries. ""There is pretty much zero accountability for those working conditions,"" she added. Scale says it is committed to paying workers ""a living wage.""\n\nBeyond the ethical considerations, there are business questions, too. What Scale is doing with Remotasks isn\'t hard to replicate. Kevin Guo, cofounder of Hive, a startup that once fielded its own Remotasks rival before shuttering it due to tough margins, contends that the sort of data labeling Scale does is a commodity business. ""Anyone who puts up a team can compete with you, and it comes down to price really quickly,"" he says.\n\nWHILE REMOTASKS\' huge overseas workforce is critical to Scale\'s private sector success, it\'s a nonstarter for the company\'s other focus: defense contracts with the U.S. government, which is unlikely to share classified data with foreign labelers. Wang is therefore building a much more expensive domestic AI army. Last year, Scale opened an office in St. Louis and announced plans to hire 200 people, many as data labelers.\n\n""There\'s two things I deeply believe,"" Wang says. ""One, AI is a huge force for good, and it needs to be applied as broadly as possible. Two, we need to make sure that America is in a leadership position.""\n\nTrain a custom AI model on live data from America\'s 1.3 million active service personnel and you might just change the nature of war.\n\nSo far Scale has made $60.6 million from such contracts, according to a government database. The company touted a $249 million award in a press release last year--but read the fine print and Scale has so far received one contract capped at $15 million. No payouts have materialized yet. The lion\'s share of government spending on AI is still going to the likes of Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, not Silicon Valley upstarts.\n\n""Those companies, they\'re really not that cutting-edge when it comes to understanding generative AI,"" Wang says. For him, government partnership is a long game. The U.S. government has already used Scale\'s expertise to make strategic sense of satellite imagery in Ukraine. And that\'s just the beginning. Generative AI, he says, could someday be used more comprehensively. Train a custom AI model on live data from America\'s 1.3 million active service personnel and you might just change the nature of war.\n\nBut it won\'t be easy to get there. Generative AI models require far more complex training than their precursors. They too need additional human help, but instead of simply labeling data harvested from the internet, people need to create it. For AI to explain why puppies are cute in a way that sounds right to the human ear, you need people to train it using natural phrasing. ""Human-annotated data turns out to be extraordinarily impactful to model performance,"" says Aidan Gomez, cofounder of Cohere, a Toronto-based OpenAI competitor that counts Scale as its primary custom data provider.\n\nNot all AI companies are sold on Scale. OpenAI, for example, relies on Scale\'s human labelers but opts to use its own software to manage the data, says cofounder Wojciech Zaremba. Three engineering leaders who used Scale at prominent AI startups told Forbes confidentially that they have concerns about the quality of its human-made AI training data. One described a text-based generative AI model that was hampered by the labelers\' poor English. ""Their data quality can be high, but also that\'s not a given,"" said another. Said a Scale spokesperson: ""We stand behind our products and [their] results.""\n\n""Wang didn\'t get to where he is because he\'s a boy genius--MIT pumps out a lot of teenage dropouts. He has an absolutely insane work ethic.""\n\nAlternatives are emerging. San Francisco–based Surge AI, which debuted in 2020, offers data labeling tools and specifically targets AI companies. OpenAI, along with upcoming AI heavies Cohere and Adept, use both Scale and Surge. Then there are billion-dollar Bay Area labeling startups Labelbox and Snorkel AI, which focus on bringing AI to non-tech enterprises.\n\nIn January, Scale slashed 20% of its full-time staff. Wang cited ""uncertainty"" in market conditions. ""We increased head count assuming the massive growth would continue,"" he wrote in a blog post. Shares of the company are currently trading on private secondary markets at a 42% discount to the last funding round in July 2021.\n\nScale\'s stakeholders remain confident Wang can keep the company ahead of its rivals. ""He didn\'t get to where he is because he\'s a boy genius--MIT pumps out a lot of teenage dropouts,"" says William Hockey, the billionaire cofounder of $13 billion fintech Plaid, who sits on Scale\'s board. ""He has an absolutely insane work ethic like nobody I\'ve ever met.""\n\nScale recently signed a strategic partnership with consulting giant Accenture, which plans to use its services to help hundreds of companies build custom AI apps and models. And with nearly a quarter-million human labelers, Remotasks is still growing, Wang confirms. All this growth comes down to what he views as Scale\'s ultimate purpose: playing a role in maintaining America\'s AI supremacy.\n\n""We\'re in an era of great power competition,"" he says. ""American leadership--I don\'t want to say it\'s at risk, but it\'s never been more important for us to retain that.""\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated to clarify the nature of Scale\'s usage in Ukraine and the details of a government contract. https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/04/11/how-alexandr-wang-turned-an-army-of-clickworkers-into-a-73-billion-ai-unicorn/"

Now, robotics is very much in vogue and has mass use across industries. One of the key reasons to deploy these programmable machines is their high efficiency and the ability to work for longer hours than humans without getting tired.\n\nHowever, a video has surfaced showing a robot placing plastic containers on a conveyor belt. The video is in a time-lapse, suggesting that the robot has been on the job for hours and the last few frames show the real-time where the machine picks up a container and as soon as it lifts it, it collapses.\n\nThe video is shared on Twitter by Videos that will surprise you   @moistonig with the caption, ""Video of a robot collapsing in a scene that seemed to fall from tiredness after a long day\'s work…""\n\nVideo of a robot collapsing in a scene that seemed to fall from tiredness after a long day\'s work… pic.twitter.com/EFw8giecrM\n\n-- Videos that will surprise you   (@moistonig) April 11, 2023\n\nSometime back we shared a similar video that showed a robot assigned the task of placing a box into a plastic container. Not only did it fail to accomplish the task but it falls face down.\n\nAbout 5-6 decades back we toyed around with the idea of manufacturing electronic humans, i.e., robots who would be made of metal and perform tasks just like human beings. Then we had a plethora of sci-fi movies and TV serials depicting the robots doing exactly as ordered.

"AI as your investment manager in future? Investing has long been a complex and often overwhelming process, requiring extensive research, analysis, and decision-making. However, with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been growing interest in using AI algorithms to manage investments. Can AI be the investment manager of the future? Let\'s explore the research and real-time experiments to find out.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Banking and Finance in 2020, robo-advisors, or AI-powered investment management services, can provide cost-effective and personalized investment advice to clients, particularly for those with limited investment knowledge or smaller portfolios. The study found that robo-advisors can achieve similar or better returns than traditional investment managers.\n\nOne such real-time experiment is conducted by wealth management firm, Morgan Stanley. The firm is using AI algorithms to analyze market trends and make investment decisions for its clients. According to Business Insider, Morgan Stanley\'s AI algorithm, called ""Next Best Action,"" can suggest investment ideas to human advisors by scanning through market trends and past investment decisions.\n\nAnother experiment is being conducted by BlackRock, the world\'s largest asset manager. BlackRock has been using AI and machine learning to analyze market data and make investment decisions. According to a report by Forbes, BlackRock\'s AI algorithms have been able to identify market trends and make investment decisions more quickly and accurately than human investors.\n\nHowever, there are still concerns around using AI as an investment manager. One potential issue is the lack of transparency in some AI algorithms, which can make it difficult to understand how investment decisions are being made. There is also the risk of ""black box"" models, where the algorithm makes decisions without providing any explanation or justification for its actions.\n\nTo address these concerns, some companies are working on developing more transparent AI algorithms. For example, the wealth management firm Wealthfront has developed a ""PassivePlus"" investment strategy that uses a transparent, rules-based approach to investing. The algorithm behind PassivePlus has been designed to be easy to understand and explain, providing investors with more transparency and control over their investments.\n\nIn conclusion, AI-powered investment management services show promise for the future of investing. Real-time experiments and research have shown that AI algorithms can identify market trends and make investment decisions more quickly and accurately than human investors. However, there are still concerns around transparency and the potential risks of using AI as an investment manager. As such, it\'s important for investors to do their research and consider the specific algorithms and models used, as well as the fees and risks involved. Diversification of investments and considering a range of investment strategies are also important. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-your-investment-manager-future-stallion-virtual-nft-arts"

"Developer Creates 'Self-Healing' Programs That Fix Themselves Thanks To AI An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Debugging a faulty program can be frustrating, so why not let AI do it for you? That\'s what a developer that goes by ""BioBootloader"" did by creating Wolverine, a program that can give Python programs ""regenerative healing abilities,"" reports Hackaday. (Yep, just like the Marvel superhero.) ""Run your scripts with it and when they crash, GPT-4 edits them and explains what went wrong,"" wrote BioBootloader in a tweet that accompanied a demonstration video. ""Even if you have many bugs it\'ll repeatedly rerun until everything is fixed."" In the demo video for Wolverine, BioBootloader shows a side-by-side window display, with Python code on the left and Wolverine results on the right in a terminal. He loads a custom calculator script in which he adds a few bugs on purpose, then executes it. ""It runs it, it sees the crash, but then it goes and talks to GPT-4 to try to figure out how to fix it,"" he says. GPT-4 returns an explanation for the program\'s errors, shows the changes that it tries to make, then re-runs the program. Upon seeing new errors, GPT-4 fixes the code again, and then it runs correctly. In the end, the original Python file contains the changes added by GPT-4. https://developers.slashdot.org/story/23/04/11/2247218/developer-creates-self-healing-programs-that-fix-themselves-thanks-to-ai"
"Around 40% of domestic tasks could be automated in 10 years, study finds A group of researchers has found that 4 in 10 hours allocated to domestic tasks today may be automated within the decade.\n\nResearchers from Ochanomizu University and the University of Oxford found that an average of around 40% of domestic work involving unpaid housework or the caring for family members could become automated in the next 10 years.\n\nGrocery shopping was the household task that would most likely become automated, with 59% of it considered possible to automate in the coming decade. The study found that 52% of tasks involving the use of services such as banking transactions would be susceptible to automation, while 50% of shopping for nongrocery items could be automated in the next 10 years.\n\nThis could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.\n\nPlease add japantimes.co.jp and piano.io to your list of allowed sites.\n\nIf this does not resolve the issue or you are unable to add the domains to your allowlist, please see this FAQ.\n\nWe humbly apologize for the inconvenience. https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/04/12/national/domestic-tasks-automation-study/"
"Learn Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing Now - KDnuggets There are all sorts of options for learning modern natural language processing, notably those options with neural networks techniques. For example, there is freely-available course material from world class universities such as Stanford's Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, among others. There are also courses, paid and otherwise, from independent non-university sources such as Coursera and fast.ai. There is a wide variety of quality books that have been published over the recent few years which are topical and up-to-date.\n\nToday, if you want to learn modern natural language processing techniques, there is no excuse for not doing so.\n\nShould none of the aforementioned resources not be to your liking, check out Neural Networks for NLP, a very recent offering from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Taught by Graham Neubig, with co-instructor Pengfei Liu, this course sets the stage for itself as such:\n\nNeural networks provide powerful new tools for modeling language, and have been used both to improve the state-of-the-art in a number of tasks and to tackle new problems that were not easy in the past. This class will start with a brief overview of neural networks, then spend the majority of the class demonstrating how to apply neural networks to natural language problems. Each section will introduce a particular problem or phenomenon in natural language, describe why it is difficult to model, and demonstrate several models that were designed to tackle this problem. In the process of doing so, the class will cover different techniques that are useful in creating neural network models, including handling variably sized and structured sentences, efficient handling of large data, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, structured prediction, and multilingual modeling.\n\nAvailable resources includes videos, slides, readings, projects, assignments, code.\n\nYou can find a direct link to the course lecture videos here.\n\nBrowsing the class schedule will give you an idea of what to expect from the course.\n\nLooking for introductory concepts such as neural networks basics? This course has got you covered.\n\nLooking for neural networks training tips and tricks? Again, covered.\n\nWant to cover modern breakthrough concepts such as contextual word representations, sequence to sequence models, adversarial methods for text, and attention? You've come to the right place.\n\nThis course is actually running right now, and so is very up-to-date. As of the time of this writing, the course has only a single class left, however, and so now is a great time to start learning from freely-available notes, videos, codes, and more. As COVID has impacted learning, this course was actually designed to be taught asynchronously at a distance, and so the materials are optimized for others, like you, to use remotely.\n\nIt should be mentioned that while access to much of the material is freely-available to non-students, there are no credentials offered for non-students who decide to learn from it. This is stated explicitly in case it is not obvious to the reader.\n\nClick on the link to the class and check out its description, class schedule, and the video playlist, and see if the CMU Neural Networks for NLP class if the one you've been waiting for to learn contemporary NLP. Don't let these valuable, and freely-available resources slip past you. https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/04/learn-neural-networks-natural-language-processing-now.html"
"Videos purport to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week which purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThe videos appear to be of separate events – one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer.\n\nThe first video, which was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle.\n\nIn the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker\'s identification.\n\n""(The armored vehicle) got f**ked by a mine,"" the voice, speaking Russian, says.\n\nApparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, ""They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.""\n\nThe dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.\n\nRussian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war\'s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video\'s location.\n\nThe second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began.\n\nShortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted, ""There will be an accountability for everything."" An official Ukrainian government Telegram channel said the tweet was a direct reference to ""another execution video published by Russians.""\n\nOn Monday, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Wagner was ""reportedly continuing to commit war crimes by beheading Ukrainian servicemen in Bakhmut,"" referencing a photo shared on pro-Russian social media sites showing what appeared to be a severed head, which they claimed belonged to a Ukrainian soldier, mounted on a spike.\n\nThe ISW has reported similar incidents in Popasna, in the Luhansk region, where Wagner troops were also operating earlier in the war.\n\nSome pro-Russian social media accounts have suggested Ukrainian forces were responsible for the beheadings in an effort to conceal identification. This echoes a similar claim made by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in January after his fighters apparently found bodies with severed hands and heads near Bakhmut. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/11/europe/beheading-videos-ukraine-intl-hnk-ml/index.html"
"Australia's big emitters explore investment in carbon projects as compliance looms Australia\'s biggest polluters are exploring investments in carbon credit projects to lower costs related to fulfilling offset compliance requirements under the country\'s strengthened emissions reductions scheme.\n\nReceive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience.\n\nThe Australian parliament passed legislation on March 30 to strengthen the country\'s emissions compliance scheme, called Safeguard Mechanism. The scheme covers 219 industrial facilities that produce over 100,000 mt/year of greenhouse gases and account for about 28% of Australia\'s total emissions.\n\nUnder the scheme, the facilities are given emissions limits and those exceeding the limits need to offset the emissions through Australian carbon credit units, or ACCUs.\n\n""Unlike in the European compliance market, you can access credits at a much lower cost [in Australia] if you get involved at the early stage,"" a carbon project analyst from a major energy company told S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\nThe new legislation mandates that the emissions limits will fall 4.9% annually starting from fiscal year 2023-24 (July-June), with an aim to cap total emissions from the scheme to 100 million mt by 2030 compared with a projected 143 million mt in FY 2022-23.\n\nThe new requirements are expected to increase the demand for ACCUs from big emitters, which included coal and gas projects, and steel and aluminum plants.\n\n""Big emitters are looking to invest in this if they have a huge exposure to lower that cost base essentially. It is a big obligation for an Australian company that they have never faced before,"" the analyst said.\n\nA compliance manager from a major transportation company with significant exposure to Safeguard Mechanism under new reforms said that ACCUs were expected to play a major role in fulfilling their compliance requirements.\n\n""We are certainly approaching opportunities with project developers,"" the manager said, adding that the company was also open to buying ACCUs from the spot market.\n\nMeanwhile, the spot market price of ACCUs has been rising, especially since the government proposed the reforms in 2022.\n\nPlatts assessed the price of Generic ACCUs at A$38.50/mtCO2e ($25.62/mtCO2e) and Human Induced Regeneration, or HIR ACCUs at A$38.75/mtCO2e on April 11, S&P Global Commodity Insights data showed.\n\nWhile Generic ACCUs are generated by avoided emissions-based projects, such as landfill gas, HIR ACCUs are generated by projects that store carbon by regenerating permanent native forests through alternative land management practices.\n\n""The trajectory of the market would suggest that makes sense for the larger players to do to hedge against future risk by owning your own project in terms of price risk,"" said Kyle Hamilton, associate director, markets, at Reputex, a Melbourne-based carbon research provider.\n\nSome companies have already taken the lead by acquiring or investing in carbon project developers.\n\nOil and gas company Shell Australia bought a major Australian project developer, Select Carbon, in 2020, while industrial conglomerate Mitsui acquired a 33.7% stake in another major project developer, Climate Friendly, in 2022.\n\nHIR projects were being seen as the most popular among the investors due to lower costs, followed by more capital-intensive environmental plantings, or EP.\n\n""EP is also very attractive because it is a carbon removal process, which is very much less criticized,"" the analyst added.\n\nThe ACCU market came under strong criticism in 2022 from academics, who alleged lack of integrity within the project methods.\n\nHowever, a government-backed panel, called Chubb Review, mostly upheld the integrity of the market, especially the HIR method, in its report published in January.\n\nThe review recommended some changes such as tightening of credit supply to landfill gas, discontinuation of avoided deforestation method and demanding more evidence for HIR projects.\n\nWhile the project developers accepted the findings as bullish for the carbon market, some buyers are still not convinced.\n\n""There is still a bit of uncertainty about which ACCUs you should go after and 5-6 years down the line, are you going to get penalized because you used some ACCU back here that has now lost favor or is now not viewed appropriately,"" the manager said. https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/041223-australias-big-emitters-explore-investment-in-carbon-projects-as-compliance-looms"
"Michael Jordan's 1998 NBA Finals sneakers sell for a record $2.2 million Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n\nThis story was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction.\n\nIn 1998, Michael Jordan laced up a pair of his iconic black and red Air Jordan 13s to bring home a Bulls victory during Game 2 of his final NBA championship -- and now they are the most expensive sneakers ever to sell at auction. The game-winning sneakers sold for $2.2 million at Sotheby\'s in New York on Tuesday, smashing the sneaker auction record of $1.47 million, set in 2021 by a pair of Nike Air Ships that Jordan wore earlier in his career.\n\nRemember when Dennis Rodman put on a wedding dress and claimed to marry himself?\n\nThe sale arrives during ""Jordan Year"" -- a reference to the NBA star player\'s iconic jersey number 23. In January, Air Jordan partnered with Sotheby\'s to auction off 13 pairs of retro sneakers that were designed in memory of The Notorious B.I.G. All lots outsold their high estimates of $5,000 by multiples, with the highest selling for more than $32,000.\n\nLast year, Jordan\'s Game 1 jersey, also from the 1998 finals, became the most expensive item of worn sports memorabilia to sell at auction when it fetched $10.1 million at a Sotheby\'s sale.\n\nJordan\'s farewell run with the Chicago Bulls is often referred to as ""The Last Dance,"" after the title of an ESPN and Netflix documentary that chronicled the season. Jordan announced his (second) retirement weeks before the finals, leading to the six-game series against the Utah Jazz becoming the most-watched in NBA history, based on Nielsen TV ratings. (Jordan would later return from 2001 to 2003 to play with the Washington Wizards, but did not win another championship).\n\nMichael Jordan pictured wearing the record-breaking sneakers during the NBA Finals at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, on June 05, 1998. Credit: Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\n""Michael Jordan game-worn sports memorabilia has proven time and time again to be the most elite and coveted items on the market,"" said Brahm Wachter, Sotheby\'s head of streetwear and modern collectables, in a press release prior to the sale. ""However, items from his \'Last Dance\' season are of a greater scale and magnitude as seen with our record-breaking sale of his Game 1 jersey in 2022.""\n\nThe pair of sneakers sold Tuesday were worn during Game 2, in Salt Lake City, which the Bulls won 93-88 after losing Game 1, with Jordan scoring 37 points. They are the last pair of black and red Air Jordan 13s that Jordan ever wore on the court for an NBA game, a press release from Sotheby\'s noted.\n\n13 of the best menswear looks from Oscars history\n\nFollowing Game 2, Jordan signed and gifted the set of worn shoes to the ball boy in the visitor\'s locker room, as he was known to do, according to Sotheby\'s.\n\nThe Air Jordan 13 sneakers starred in a sports memorabilia sale called ""Victoriam,"" which featured items worn by athletes including Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant and Roger Federer. Several other Jordan items were included in the two-part auction, with a game-worn 1998 Bulls jersey and a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s fetching $508,000 and $127,000 respectively.\n\nOther top lots included one of Kobe Bryant\'s LA Lakers shooting shirts, which sold for over $406,000, and a soccer jersey, worn by the late Pelé on his debut for the New York Cosmos in 1975, that sold fetched over $177,000. https://www.cnn.com/style/article/michael-jordan-sneakers-1998-finals-sothebys-auction-record/index.html"

"Massachusetts State Police Fail (Twice) To Redact Troopers' Birthdates In Public Records Response To err is human. To forgive is beyond me. Sorry. That\'s just the way it is. If we\'re paying outsized portions of local budgets to law enforcement agencies more interested in selective enforcement, rights violations, complete abdication of personal/professional responsibility, and seeing what hot war kit they can acquire via 1033.gov, it behooves us to punch up, even if that occasionally means kicking them when they\'re down.\n\nEnter the Massachusetts State Police. These troopers may be generally capable and not completely terrible at all times, but they\'ve still managed to rack up headlines at non-cop-focused sites as far-flung as Techdirt.com. Remember the time when the MSP accidentally exposed its surveillance of police critics with some poorly cropped photos of their cop shop workstations? Or how about the time a citizen complaint about a trooper triggered an investigation resulting in a bunch of troopers being fired for time card fraud? Or maybe you recall the MSP saying some nice things about dialing back its use of no-knock warrants before immediately violating the just-invoked policy changes?\n\nYeah, I hear you, unnamed critic who thinks these are relatively mild misconduct instances. I mean, that\'s just what we\'re told we\'re obliged to accept. Things could always be worse, say reps for agencies with only mild misconduct problems. In comparison (gestures broadly at US law enforcement in general) we\'re doing pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. We\'re asked to treat near-competence as excellence by cops and their reps. Pretty disgusting, especially when plenty of cop defenders pretend it\'s our subpar educational system making life unbearable for them at the moment.\n\nWell, we don\'t get what we pay for, that\'s for sure. Premium payments. Somewhat tolerable service. Even the small things are done poorly far too often. Public records enthusiast Andrew Quemere was recently on the receiving end of some subprime service from the Massachusetts State Police -- something that began with an extended delay entirely the fault of the MSP.\n\nThe Mass Dump requested the use-of-force data on March 29, 2022, and the internal affairs data on April 20, 2022. State law requires all state agencies to respond to public records requests in writing within 10 business days and provide records within 15 business days.\n\nHowever, the commonwealth\'s largest law-enforcement agency acted as though it was above the law for 11 months.\n\nWhen the Mass Dump first submitted the requests, the State Police simply ignored them. In both cases, the Mass Dump filed an appeal with the Public Records Division of the Secretary of the Commonwealth\'s Office shortly after the State Police failed to respond within 10 business days.\n\nThe State Police had eleven months to get this right. And the MSP still screwed it up. It didn\'t take the State Police another eleven months to realize it had failed to redact some information in this release to Quemere, however. MSP reps were right on top of that. Within a day of publication, Quemere was contacted by the MSP\'s chief legal counsel, Jennifer Staples.\n\n""Unfortunately, the information we provided did not have the dates of birth of the troopers redacted, that information should have been redacted pursuant to the privacy exemption to the public records law,"" Staples said in an email on Tuesday night.\n\nShe added: ""We are concerned because publishing the dates of birth of troopers poses a very serious safety risk for the troopers and their families. As such, we are requesting that you remove the information immediately.""\n\nStaples didn\'t bother to explain how publication of cops\' birth dates created a ""serious safety risk,"" but obviously the data can help ID fraudsters do their thing, so not an entirely unreasonable request. Oh no, wait. The other thing. There\'s no legal precedent for this demand to redact the information the MSP failed to redact over the eleven months it spent jerking Quemere around.\n\nThe following day, the MSP\'s lawyer sent a ""new"" version of the misconduct/use of force data to ""replace"" the one with the birth dates left exposed. Once again, Staples reiterated that troopers\' lives were at stake, although she once again failed to provide any explanation for this assumption.\n\nBut this version of the data left the data intact, too.\n\n[W]hoever created this ""redacted"" spreadsheet fell victim to one of the classic blunders. Instead of deleting the data, this person simply changed the background color of the cells with the birthdates to black to match the color of the text.\n\nIf you change the background color to white or to another color, all the dates become visible again. It\'s also possible to view the date in a cell by highlighting it and looking at the formula bar in Excel, Google Sheets, or another spreadsheet program.\n\nRather than keep being hassled by the lawyer, Quemere did for free what a $411 million/year agency couldn\'t do twice: properly redacted the ""unsafe"" birth dates. That\'s very generous, considering the MSP still owes him $180 in public records processing fees -- fees it collected and kept despite ultimately refusing to hand over anything Quemere requested. Work that can\'t be done right by the people being paid handsomely to do it shouldn\'t be performed for free by people who need the financial assistance of readers to continue to perform this much more useful public service.\n\nFiled Under: massachusetts, massachusetts state police, msp, public records, redaction failure, transparency, use of force data https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/11/massachusetts-state-police-fail-twice-to-redact-troopers-birthdates-in-public-records-response/"

"China reports first human death due to H3N8 bird flu A 56-year-old woman in southern China has died after testing positive for H3N8 avian influenza, marking the first human death from that strain of bird flu, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nWhile H3N8 is ""one of the most frequently found"" subtypes of flu in birds, it had not been detected in humans before two cases emerged in April and May last year, both in China.\n\nIn a statement, the WHO said the woman, who had pre-existing medical conditions including cancer, had been admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia after falling ill in February.

No close contacts of the case developed an infection or symptoms of illness at the time of reporting,"" WHO said in its statement on Monday.\n\nAll three people who contracted H3N8 in China are thought to have been exposed to the virus at live poultry markets. The United Nations health agency said the Chinese government had stepped up monitoring for the strain and that the risk of more infections was low.\n\n""However, due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virologic, epidemiologic and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health,"" it said.\n\nThe H3N8 infection is unrelated to the H5N1 bird flu pandemic, which has devastated poultry and wild birds around the world in the last 18 months and has spread to mammals including foxes, bears and domestic cats.\n\nTo infect humans, the H5N1 virus has to attach itself to receptors in the lungs, which the virus lacks the ability to readily bond with, William Schaffner, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University\'s Division of Infectious Diseases, told Al Jazeera in February.\n\nForced adaptation to replicating in the lungs is why only poultry workers, who breathe in contaminated faecal dust, are typically infected, Schaffner added.\n\nThe H3N8 virus is less dangerous for both wild birds and domestic poultry than H5N1, and is known to have been circulating since 2002 after first emerging in North American waterfowl.\n\nIt is also known to infect horses, dogs and seals. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/china-reports-first-human-death-due-to-h3n8-bird-flu"

"Louisville Bank Shooting: What We Know Five people were killed and eight others wounded on Monday after a 25-year-old man opened fire at a bank in downtown Louisville, Ky., where he worked. The gunman, who used an AR-15-style rifle and livestreamed the attack, was killed by the police after exchanging fire with them.\n\nThe shooter, identified by the police as Connor Sturgeon, had told at least one person that he was suicidal before the rampage at Old National Bank, and he legally purchased the rifle at a local dealership last week. The authorities have not given a motive.\n\nThe police released body camera footage on Tuesday showing two officers pulling up in their squad car outside the bank on Monday morning. The footage shows a quick initial gun battle and a rookie officer being shot before his training officer kills the assailant.\n\nSeveral officials, including Mayor Craig Greenberg, made emotional pleas to address the gun violence epidemic gripping the country and Louisville, where they said 40 people had died this year in shootings.

"Indiana recycling plant fire forces evacuation orders for thousands as it emits toxic smoke, officials say. And it could burn for days A fire that started Tuesday afternoon at a recycling plant in the eastern Indiana city of Richmond was emitting toxic smoke and has forced evacuation orders for about 2,000 people – and it is expected to burn for days, officials said.\n\nPlastics were among the items burning at the plant, and the smoke – a thick, black column rose from the site Tuesday – is ""definitely toxic,"" Indiana State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said in a news briefing.\n\n""There is a host of different chemicals that plastics give off when they\'re on fire, and it\'s concerning and we want to make for sure we give people heads-up on an evacuation,"" Jones said Tuesday evening, adding he expects the fire to burn for days.\n\nFirefighters responded to the facility Tuesday to find a semi-trailer behind one of the plant\'s building engulfed in flames, Richmond Fire Chief Tim Brown said. The trailer was loaded with an ""unknown type of plastics,"" and the fire spread to other piles of plastics around the trailer and eventually to the building, Brown said.\n\nDetails about what started the fire at the semi-trailer weren\'t immediately available.\n\nAn evacuation order was put in place for residents within a half-mile of the fire, but authorities could change the order if the direction of the wind shifts, Jones said. Residents outside of the evacuation zone but downwind of it – to the east and northeast – were being encouraged to shelter in place and bring pets inside.\n\n""We do not expect the evacuation order to be lifted tonight,"" Richmond Mayor Dave Snow said Tuesday. ""A bus will remain in place if needed and shelters are ready to accept citizens from the area.""\n\nThe evacuation order affected about 2,000 residents, the Wayne County emergency management agency told CNN.\n\nOne firefighter was injured after falling and hurting his ankle, and has since been treated and released from a hospital, Brown said.\n\nNo other injuries were reported. Everyone who was said to be working at the building when crews responding to the scene have been accounted for, Brown said.\n\n""It\'s a big enough fire that it\'s just not gonna be tonight. It\'s going to burn a while,"" Jones said.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management were on site ""evaluating any potential hazards resulting from the fire,"" Snow said in a Facebook post.\n\nFirefighters have had trouble getting access to the facility, with piles of plastic blocking access roads, Brown said. ""It creates quite a challenge because we only have access to one side of the building,"" he added.\n\n""Once the fire got out of control, it darkened down on us, (and) we backed out real quick and then went into defensive mode,"" Brown said.\n\nThe flames spread to several buildings at the site, but crews managed to stop the fire\'s spread before it could jump into residential areas, Brown said.\n\n""It\'s probably the largest fire I\'ve seen in my career,"" Brown said. https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/11/us/richmond-indiana-recycling-plant-fire/index.html"
"Drinking is killing Russian troops, according to UK intel. Widespread alcoholism during the first Crimean War 150 years ago resulted in Russia's defeat. Almost exactly 15o years ago, in a battle against the Ottoman Empire, Russia suffered a catastrophic defeat in the Crimean War -- in part due to the drinking habits taken up by the military during the fighting.\n\nMark Lawrence Schrad, director of Russian Area Studies at Villanova University and author of Vodka Politics: Alcohol, Autocracy, and the Secret History of the Russian State, wrote in 2014 that drunkenness plagued the Russian army under Tsar Nicholas I, from the lowly rank and file soldiers to the high command military leaders, as they stumbled their way through battles, only to lose 100,000 soldiers and the war itself.\n\nSchrad, in the book, details instances of befuddled Russian armies left to fight without commanders, hospitals drenched in the scent of vodka, and soldiers complaining after being deprived of their vodka rations.\n\nThe Crimean War would become another example of the county\'s war drinking problem cataloged in the annals of Russian history. Another example Schrad writes about includes the Russo-Japanese War, which Japan won despite being heavily outnumbered. Schrad cites a St. Petersburg newspaper writing, ""the Japanese found several thousand Russian soldiers so dead drunk that they were able to bayonet them like so many pigs.""\n\nAlthough not the sole reason that these wars were lost, Schrad argues that vodka played a significant part in Russia\'s failures.\n\nDuring World War I, the Tsar instituted Prohibition that lasted until Joseph Stalin took power, but Schrad writes of riots over conscription and looting of liquor stores, warehouses, and distilleries.\n\nDrinking and military history have always been entwined -- the practice fueled by myths that drinking would grant soldiers courage -- but Schrad argues that Russia has a particularly unique history with drinking that follows many through lines, particularly the country\'s history dominating the vodka trade, and the Russian conscription system, a relic of the 17th-century ruler Peter the Great.\n\nWhy does it matter now? A recent UK defense ministry intelligence update reported that many Russian troops are dying in Ukraine due to non-combat issues such as alcohol consumption, among other things. The death toll among Russian troops is now two times that of their opponents, estimates from leaked US intelligence documents reveal.\n\nSchrad told Insider that he doesn\'t want to make ""direct analogies with stuff that happened 150 years ago,"" but the parallels are there.\n\n""The alcohol angles are interesting. I don\'t think it\'s nearly as important nowadays, as it was during the Russo-Japanese War or World War One, but it\'s significant, right?"" Schrad told Insider. ""It\'s not something that you can just kind of brush aside either, right? You\'ve got a demoralized Russian army and they\'re going up against a very enthusiastic Ukrainian fighting force that\'s there to defend their homeland defend their turf.""\n\nIn an interview with Insider, Schrad expanded on the history of Russian drinking during wartime.\n\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nI read one of your articles from last year and you had basically -- I don\'t know if I want to say called it -- but you used historical precedent to predict that alcohol would play a role in the war. I want to hear from you why you felt that this was going to be an issue coming into the Ukrainian war.\n\nA lot of it is the consequence of my research topic, which has been alcohol and Russian history. It\'s been my bread and butter for ages. And a lot of it kind of revolved around my book ""Vodka Politics."" The thesis of the book was ""Why do Russians drink so much?"" Yes, there are cultural stereotypes. But the explanation I came up with was that it wasn\'t so much some sort of cultural or genetic trait, as much as it was the consequence of generations of autocratic decision-making that put the interest of the Russian state ahead of the health and well-being of the Russian people.\n\nHistorically, the thing that was most profitable to the Russian state was vodka. The monopolization of alcohol and tavern trade in Russia, going back to the czars, constituted 1/3 of all the income of the Russian state under the czars, and then even into the Soviet era, one-quarter of all revenue came from selling vodka to their own people. I think a lot of where it comes from. The book traced this thread of alcohol through all sorts of different things, including war-fighting, and you find that every time that Russia goes to war, there is this alcohol calamity. The Crimean War, the Russo-Japanese War, World War I, in particular, were all drunken fiascos.\n\nAnd so as that gets into sort of the current scenario with Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainians inherited a lot of that legacy as well -- I suppose, a kind of societal alcoholism -- but has also moved in a lot of ways towards more European systems, not only when it comes to alcohol use, but also regulation.\n\nWhen the war started, on the Ukrainian side, they instituted kind of a blanket prohibition during the first months of the war. The idea was that alcohol wasn\'t necessary to maintain discipline and morale in a time of crisis.\n\nObviously, on the Russian side, you had just the opposite. You had people stumbling into the war, completely drunk. You have a lot of these reports coming out of Ukraine from survivors of Russians committing mass atrocities, oftentimes while drunk, which is another consistent theme of history.\n\nWhen Russia started later on in 2022, with mass conscription, it was the same thing as what we saw in 1904-1905 or 1914 with World War I -- that people would show up half drunk and get into fights with the draft officers and continued the drinking straight through till they get on the battlefield.\n\nOne thing that in history we\'ve seen is there have been a lot of cultures that drink during wartime. What circumstances make Russia\'s current drinking problem unique?\n\nWhat\'s fascinating is that Russia becomes the first Prohibition country after World War I because it learned its lesson after the Russo-Japanese war, and that kind of became the cult of military sobriety. All countries that got involved in World War I were restricting availability to alcohol because all these militaries around the world learned their lesson, like Russia did, that whether you have a good fighting force or a drunken fighting force can really make the difference between victory and defeat. So I would say since World War I there has been more of an international consensus towards limiting alcohol in the ranks, especially when it comes to warfighting.\n\nI think when it comes to especially more modern forces, Russia is still very much stuck in the past of having that pervasiveness of alcohol whereas a more modern army might not have that. Russia\'s armies in a lot of ways are kind of a relic of the past. It\'s still pretty much a conscript army. It\'s not a modern volunteer army. And so you\'ve got a lot of those holdovers from the past, and I think that that might be part of it as well. But the fact is that you\'re getting people in wartime positions, who really didn\'t sign up for this, as opposed to American soldiers or British soldiers who choose this lifestyle right for one reason or another.\n\nYou know, the last time that we had a draft in the United States, during Vietnam, there was a lot of drug abuse and alcoholism that came with that as well. That could be part of the dynamic, too.\n\nIt seems like Russia is aware of this. Why does Russia continue to hold on to this conscription system despite evidence that it could lead to drinking issues among servicemen?\n\nI think it\'s been hard to reform for one. But then, more importantly, Russia has also, in more recent years, been undergoing something of a demographic crisis. When the Soviet Union falls apart in the early 1990s, there was just, economic decay, disorder, and depression. In Russia, they had sort of a baby bust from the \'90s through the mid-2000s. That\'s the generation now that would be coming up for military service, and there are just not enough people there.\n\nWhen it comes to this demographic crisis that\'s plagued Russia for a long time the military has been sort of the most astute at this. They\'ve been sort of raising alarm bells for the last 20 years, in terms of wanting to reform and make a more modern army, but also recognizing that they needed to sort of maintain conscription just because if they were to give it up, they wouldn\'t have enough warm bodies to man all the turrets and field all the positions that they need. https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-vodka-historian-sees-parallels-between-now-and-past-wars-2023-4"
